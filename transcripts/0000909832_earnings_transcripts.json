If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time.\nAnd thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Costco's Q4 2025 Earnings Call. I'd like to start by reminding you that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.\nThe risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nComparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Before we dive into our financial results, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is once again joining me for today's call. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you, Gary. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we wrap up fiscal year 2025, I'll make a few brief comments on some of the highlights. In Q4, we opened 10 new warehouses, including a relocation in Canada, our 20th warehouse in Korea, our second warehouse in Sweden, and five net new locations in the US. For the fiscal year, we opened 27 new warehouses, including three relocations, for a total of 24 net new buildings. This brings our total warehouse count to 914 worldwide.\nWe plan to open another 35 warehouses in fiscal year 2026, of which five are relocations. We continue to see significant opportunities for expansion both domestically and internationally across the markets where we currently operate. Gary will go into details about the quarter results, but a few highlights for the fiscal year.\nNet sales came in just under $270 billion, an increase of over 8% versus last year, and e-commerce sales exceeded $19.6 billion, increasing over 15%. We had a record year for gas volumes, which benefited from longer gas station hours, new gas stations, and expansions of existing gas stations as well. We also recently celebrated a few milestones, including the 40th anniversary of our $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. Fittingly, we have just completed the rollout of Coca-Cola, the original soda partner from the 1985 inception of the iconic combo, to all food courts worldwide.\nOur private label Kirkland Signature reached its 30th year anniversary this year. Kirkland Signature sales penetration continues to increase, bringing even more high-quality value to our members while offsetting potentially inflationary impacts from tariffs.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are continuing to look at opportunities to move more KS product sourcing into the countries and regions where the items are sold, and this is helping to lower costs as well as reduce emissions from transporting goods around the world. To increase value and convenience for our members, on 30 June 2025, we added Executive Member-exclusive operating hours in the mornings and an additional hour on Saturday evenings for all members in our US warehouses. We estimate these incremental hours have added about 1% to weekly US sales since implementation. This has been very well received by our members.\nIn addition to the early opening hours for Executive Members, we also introduced a $10 credit per month on Instacart purchases greater than $150. Since announcing these new executive benefits, we've seen the meaningful increase in upgrades from Gold Star members to Executive Membership.\nAnother way we are improving the member experience is through the rollout of enhanced checkout technology in all US warehouses. This is speeding up the checkout process by allowing our employees to scan small and medium-sized transactions while the member is still in line. So upon reaching the cashier, nothing has to be removed from the cart, only payment is needed. We also continue to make progress with our technology roadmap for digital and e-commerce.\nEnhancements this quarter included using data augmentation to improve search effectiveness, adding passwordless sign-in to our mobile app, and creating a waiting room for high-velocity items such as Pokémon cards. These waiting rooms reduce the traffic from bots, increase the opportunity for members to purchase high-demand items, while improving the speed and the stability of the site during peak traffic periods.\nReflecting on fiscal year 2025 overall, our merchandising and operations team did a fantastic job delivering strong financial results while also investing in our employees and improving value and convenience for our members. Our merchants adjusted their plans to mitigate tariff impacts and source items that our members need while delivering the lowest price at the best value.\nOur operators quickly and efficiently adapted to pay raises in March 2024, July 2024, and again March 2025 that brought our average hourly US wage to over $31 per hour, and most recently, to the expansion of our operating hours. Their focus on efficiency and improving productivity allowed us to absorb these significant investments with minimal impact to our SG&A rate.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal year 2026, despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in our ability to grow market share by continuing to deliver exciting, high-quality items at the best value for our members. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back in during Q&A to field some questions.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for Q4 of fiscal year 2025, the 16 weeks ended 31 August 2025. As usual, we've published a slide deck under events and presentations on our investor website with supplemental information to support today's press release. Net income for Q4 came in at $2.61 billion, or $5.87 per diluted share, up 11% from $2.35 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share in Q4 last year.\nLast year's results included a non-recurring tax benefit of $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Excluding this tax item, net income and earnings per diluted share both grew 14%. Net sales for Q4 were $84.43 billion, an increase of 8% from $78.18 billion in Q4 last year. Comparable sales were 5.7%, or 6.4% adjusted for gas deflation and FX.\nE-commerce comparable sales were 13.6%, or 13.5% adjusted for FX. Our segment breakout of comparable sales is disclosed in both our earnings release and the supplemental slide deck. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, FX positively impacted sales by approximately 0.2%, while gas price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.9%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.7% worldwide. Our average transaction or ticket was up 1.9% worldwide. This includes the impacts from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, ticket would have been up 2.6% worldwide.\nMoving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.72 billion, an increase of $212 million, or 14% year-over-year. Adjusting for FX, the increase was 13.6%. Last September's US and Canada membership fee increase accounted for a little less than half of the membership fee income growth in the quarter.\nExcluding the membership fee increase and FX, membership income grew 7% year-over-year. This was driven by continued growth in our membership base and increased upgrades from Gold Star to Executive Membership. At Q4 end, we had 38.7 million paid Executive Memberships, up 9.3% versus last year. Executive members represented 47.7% of paid members and 74.2% of worldwide sales. As Ron mentioned earlier, we have recently seen a lift in upgrades in the US after we announced our Executive Member exclusive hours and other benefits.\nNew member sign-ups continue to be strong, and we ended the fiscal year with 81 million total paid members, up 6.3% versus last year, and 145.2 million cardholders, up 6.1% year-over-year. In terms of renewal rates at Q4 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.3%, and the worldwide rate came in at 89.8%.\nThe decline in renewal rates was largely attributable to a higher number of online sign-ups entering the renewal rate, and this quarter included a large Groupon campaign in December 2023 entering the calculation. Overall, we view the growth in online sign-ups as a net positive, as they are helping to grow our overall membership base and membership revenue, and are also introducing younger members to Costco. Almost half of our new member sign-ups are now under the age of 40.\nAs we've previously shared, new online members renew at a slightly lower rate on average, and they have grown as a percentage of our sign-ups over recent years. We would therefore expect to continue to see a small decline in our renewal rate as this change in membership mix gets fully reflected in our renewal rate calculation.\nThat being said, through a focus on auto-renewal and targeted digital communications, our goal is to improve the renewal rate for this cohort of new members in the future. Turning to gross margin, our reported rate in Q4 was higher year-over-year by 13 basis points, coming in at 11.13% compared to 11% last year. Gross margin was up 3 basis points excluding gas deflation. Core was higher by 30 basis points and higher by 22 basis points without gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 29 basis points. This increase was broad-based with fresh, foods and sundries, and non-foods all up year-over-year.\nSupply chain improvements and an increase in KS penetration benefited margins in all categories, while fresh further benefited from lower spoilage and labor efficiencies.\nAncillary and other businesses' gross margin was lower by 11 basis points, and 13 basis points without gas deflation. Gas was the main driver of the decrease. LIFO negatively impacted the gross margin rate by 6 basis points. We had a $43 million LIFO charge in Q4 this year compared to an $8 million credit in Q4 last year. This charge was essentially in line with the estimate we provided last quarter, as overall inflation remained consistent with Q3.\nMoving on to SG&A, our reported SG&A rate in Q4 was higher or worse year-over-year by 17 basis points, coming in at 9.21% compared to last year's 9.04%. SG&A was higher or worse by 9 basis points adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher or worse by 15 basis points, and 8 basis points without gas deflation.\nThis increase was partly due to our investment in employee wages. As noted last quarter, the incremental year-over-year impact from this year's March employee agreement was mid-single-digit basis points, and the off-cycle wage increase in July 2024, which affected the year-over-year rate comparison for the first 10 weeks of Q4, was mid- to high single-digit basis points. An increase in general liability charges and reserves also negatively impacted SG&A this quarter by approximately 5 basis points. To partially offset these headwinds, our operators continue to do a great job leveraging strong top-line sales and improving labor productivity.\nNotably, following the change in warehouse hours on 30 June 2024, our operators were able to minimize any impact to the SG&A rate. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $46 million versus $49 million last year, and interest income was $169 million versus $138 million last year.\nFX and other was a $46 million gain in Q4 this year versus an $18 million loss last year. In terms of income taxes, our Q4 tax rate was 25.6% compared to 24.4% last year. As a reminder, last year's tax rate included a non-recurring benefit of $63 million related to a transfer pricing settlement and true-ups of tax reserves. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. Capital expenditure in Q4 was approximately $1.97 billion, and for the full year was a little under $5.5 billion. We made some additional investments in Q4 to support accelerated warehouse growth, including the 35 planned openings in fiscal year 2026 that Ron mentioned earlier.\nAdditionally, we increased our pace of spend on remodels to ensure that we continue to offer our members a best-in-class experience across all of our warehouses.\nLand purchases for future depot expansions and investments in our manufacturing facilities for expanded hot dog production and a new coffee roasting facility also contributed to the increased spend. A few fun sales facts as we wrap up our fiscal year. While our members love the treasure hunt items that they find in our warehouses and online, our everyday value items are also extremely important to them, especially in times of economic uncertainty. There are no better examples of this than our hot dog combo, rotisserie chicken, and KS bath tissue.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we sold over 245 million hot dog combos, over 157 million rotisserie chickens, and enough bath tissue to reach the moon and back over 200 times. Now taking a look at core merchandising sales in the quarter. Fresh sales were up high single digits, led by double-digit growth in meat.\nWe continue to see strong unit growth across the department due to the quality and value we offer on both premium and lower-cost proteins. Wagyu and grass-fed beef performed well in the quarter, and lower-cost proteins like poultry, pork, and ground beef also saw very strong unit growth. Non-foods had comp sales in the high single digits. Our buyers continue to do an excellent job finding new and exciting items at great values, which are resonating well with members, even as they remain very choiceful in their spending on discretionary items.\nIn the quarter, gold and jewelry, gift cards, majors, toys, and men's apparel were all up double digits. While gold was less of a year-over-year tailwind than earlier in the year, as we have now started to lap sales from a year ago, it continues to perform well.\nStrength in gift cards was driven by Disney, Uber, and DoorDash, and majors were up high teens, with consumer electronics leading the way. We also added a number of new high-quality national brand partnerships across a broad range of non-food categories, including Fabletics, True Classic, Aura, and La-Z-Boy. Food and sundries had mid to high single-digit comps, with cola and candy showing the strongest results.\nNew Kirkland Signature offerings allow us to continue to deliver greater value to members and are high-quality alternatives to some tariff-impacted goods. KS items typically offer members 15% to 20% value compared to the national brand alternative, with equal or better quality. In Q4, we launched over 30 new KS items, including grass-fed beef sticks, organic extra firm tofu, and various apparel items, in addition to our latest food court offering, the Combo Calzone.\nWithin ancillary businesses, pharmacy, optical, and hearing aids all had strong quarters. While gas volumes were positive low single digits in the quarter, gas comps were negative mid to high single digits due to a lower average price per gallon. Turning to inflation, overall inflation remained in the low to mid single digit range. Fresh and food and sundries were relatively similar to last quarter, with higher inflation in key commodities like beef, coffee, sugar, and corn, partially offset by lower inflation in produce, eggs, butter, and cocoa.\nIn non-foods, we saw inflation return for the second consecutive quarter, primarily driven by imported items. This inflation drove the $43 million LIFO charge for the quarter, which is calculated by comparing the net landing cost of inventory at the beginning of the fiscal year with the net landing cost of inventory on hand at the end of the fiscal year.\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers to find ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including moving the country of production where it makes sense and consolidating our buying efforts globally to lower the cost of goods across all our markets. Additionally, we are changing item assortment where appropriate. This includes leaning into KS items and increasing domestically sourced goods. Examples include an increased emphasis on items in health and beauty, live goods, tires, and mattresses.\nWe believe our expertise in buying and the flexibility afforded by our limited SKU count give us greater agility to navigate the current environment and minimize the impact of tariffs. Our ultimate goal is to increase our member values compared to the market. From a supply chain perspective, we haven't seen any major changes since last quarter. Overall, supply remains relatively stable with no notable issues.\nLooking ahead to the holiday season, our merchants feel good about our inventory position. While the product mix will look a little different from years past, we will have a strong assortment of high-quality items that bring meaningful value, seasonal themes, and exciting newness to our members.\nTurning now to digital, e-commerce site traffic was up 27%, and sales were led by gold and jewelry, housewares, apparel, tires, sporting goods, majors, small electrics, lawn and garden, and domestics, all of which grew double digits year-over-year. We continue to grow share in big and bulky items sold online, powered by our investments in Costco Logistics. The combination of great values and the delivery experience that includes installation and haulaway of old items is resonating extremely well with members and resulted in a 13% increase in items delivered in the quarter.\nQ4 fiscal year 2025 marked the 15th consecutive quarter of improved member experience scores on Costco Logistics deliveries. A key focus of our digital strategy is to deliver a seamless experience and more personalized and relevant communications to our members. This is a multi-year journey, and as we complete the foundational elements of our plan, we are able to launch new experiences for members. For example, during Q4, we launched more relevant messaging on the costco.com homepage, highlighting different offers depending on the individual's membership type and co-brand credit card status.\nExecutive Members are shown information about executive benefits, while Gold Star members are encouraged to upgrade their membership, and non-members are shown information about becoming members. Co-brand card holders will be shown offers associated with ongoing spend campaigns, while non-card holders will be shown acquisition offers.\nThese digital capabilities are also a key enabler for retail media, as they allow us to target specific ads that deliver greater value for both members and suppliers, while always honoring the privacy choices of our members. As an example, we recently executed a series of targeted MVM amplification campaigns with Kimberly-Clark on third-party websites. This resulted in a strong return on ad spend of 14 to 1, drove a 22% increase in traffic to the product details pages, and a 45% increase in digital sales of the promoted items.\nAs we continue to execute our digital and technology roadmap, we are excited about the opportunities this creates to further enhance the member experience and drive top-line sales. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 5 October 2025, on Wednesday, 8 October 2025, after market close.\nBased on feedback received from investors, starting with our September sales release, we'll be changing our e-commerce comparable sales metric to now report digitally enabled comparable sales. This measure will incorporate all sales that originated online, including our same-day delivery service fulfilled by Instacart, Uber Eats, and DoorDash, Costco Travel, Business Center delivery, and a few other smaller direct-to-member businesses. We believe this change aligns our reporting more closely with how our retail peers disclose this metric. For fiscal year 2025, our digitally enabled sales totaled more than $27 billion.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And if you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one a second time. If you're called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue.\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nBroadlines and Hardlines Retail Analyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks. Good evening. So my question has to do with the extended member hours. To what extent do you think that your members are actually aware of these extended hours? Was the 30 June 2025 a soft launch, and you made a harder launch as you came into the fall? And how do you think about that 1% comp lift in terms of it becoming much larger? Thanks very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I think that this is Ron. I think the communication, we have done a good job informing our members, both with signage at the warehouse along with emails to our Executive Members. So we saw we really based that success based on the traffic we saw when we initially began these additional hours. The 1% is after we've analyzed the business compared to the prior months and to see how much we've picked up both on the additional Saturday night hour along with the early morning hours as well.\nSo we feel that the word is out there. We feel that we continue to communicate the Executive Member benefits as we continue to add to that suite of services that they get, and that is inclusive of the hour that they get as well.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nChris, I think as well, just to completely agree with Ron's comments, it's one of those things that obviously it's a little bit difficult to predict exactly how the change flows through in terms of impact of member shopping behavior. To Ron's point, we did a lot of communication. When we made changes before around, so some of our warehouses had longer hours before, it probably took a little bit longer than the first month or so for the full impact to show through in terms of member shopping behavior. But with that being said, I think because this was a national launch, we did get more visibility and more social media exposure to it as well. So I think we've been pleased with the response we've seen, but there's certainly probably more time to unfold to see exactly how it plays out.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nBroadlines and Hardlines Retail Analyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. You mentioned that you would expect your renewal rate to continue to fall as some of the digital sign-ups are traded out of the base. How far do you expect to see the membership rate decline? If we look back in the pre-COVID and in 2018, Costco regularly had a worldwide renewal rate in the mid- to high-80% range. Is it realistic for it to go back to that? And if it did, what actions would Costco take in order to stabilize or improve that? And how is this all going to impact the financial performance? Thank you very much.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah, thanks, Michael. Appreciate the question. I think we take a little bit of a broader step back on the membership metrics because, to your point, we certainly look at the renewal rate, and it's an important measure for us. I'll talk a little bit more about how we view the opportunity to improve that metric over time as well. I do think when we look at our overall metrics for membership, we were pleased with how the quarter played out.\nI think you heard us say in the prepared remarks that we're seeing a continued increase in sign-ups, and that's also reflecting a growing number of younger members flowing into the base as well. We saw an acceleration in upgrades, particularly towards the end of the quarter after we announced the extended hours and the Instacart $10 benefit per month if you spend $150 on the basket.\nAnd we also saw overall household growth grow by greater than 6% and Executive Members up by over 9% because of the acceleration in upgrades. And then on membership fee income, actually our membership fee income was a little bit ahead of where we'd have budgeted at the start of the year. So looking at sort of the overall impact of the membership fee increase and the way that members were behaving overall, we're actually ahead of where we'd have budgeted based on everything we knew at that point.\nSo I think it's important just to take that bigger picture step back because overall, we think the membership base, the renewal rate is very strong overall, and the results that we're seeing in growth in our overall membership engagement is also very strong.\nNow, with all that being said, as I mentioned a moment ago, we do view the membership renewal rate as an important measure, and we've analyzed it very closely, as you might imagine, because it's something that we take pride in, the overall level of membership renewal that we see. When we analyze it, it really is essentially the vast majority of it is attributable to this higher number of online sign-ups.\nAnd if you look at what's happened really since COVID, we've seen in the last three or four years a significant growth in the number of members and the proportion of members that are signing up online. And that's bringing in newer members. It's helping to grow everything I just mentioned around membership fee income and overall membership base, but they do renew at a slightly lower rate.\nAs you think about how our membership renewal rate works and how it lags the effect of some of those changes, we're really sort of flowing through the impact of that into a sort of changing mix, if you like, of the overall base. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do think we'll see a few more quarters of a similar type of impact that we saw in this quarter with the 40 basis point decline.\nThat being said, as we learn more about how to engage with those newer digital members, we're really investing in the opportunities to improve the auto-renewal with that member group, increase the amount of digital communication, and more relevant communication for those members who are joining Costco starting online rather than starting in the warehouse.\nSo we have to think about how we can help really get them to experience more of the great value that we offer in a broader relationship. So we think there's opportunities to improve that measure, but overall, we like where we are with the membership metrics in total because of the overall growth it's driving in our membership income.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGood afternoon. Can we dive into your core margins a little bit, up 29 basis points year-over-year, how that spans across categories? And then, more broad`ly, curious any notable observations on price increases you've taken recently, and I guess what unit velocity you're observing in those product categories? And then just the last question, just on the holiday, you called out how the product mix might be different than years past. Can we just double-click on that comment? I guess what might be different in terms of, particularly, in the general merchandise part of the business? Thanks.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Chuck. I'll cover the first couple of parts around margin and tariffs, and then Ron will talk a little bit more about assortment for the holidays. On the gross margin rate, so yeah, I talked a little bit about it in the prepared comments, but overall, I think our focus was on the gross margin rate, which overall grew by three basis points excluding gas.\nAnd when we think about the job our buyers did and merchants did to navigate tariffs and make sure we were still delivering tremendous value for our members, then we feel that was a really good outcome, and we were pleased with the way in which the team was able to manage staying true to who we are as a company and delivering value while also being able to deliver an overall slight improvement in the gross margin rate.\nThe core on core margin was definitely the strength area. That was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly widespread across all three of our main categories. So fresh, food and sundries, and non-foods all saw a slight improvement in the core on core margin. But it was really in our merchants and operators focusing on how can we offset some of the impacts that we're seeing in the business through tariffs. So a lot of the improvement came from supply chain efficiency with improvements by the operators in our depots, and also gas prices helping us there as well.\nWe also saw some mixed benefits with Kirkland Signature penetration improving. And then similar to last quarter, in fresh in particular, the teams did a great job of reducing spoilage or shrink, as some retailers call it, and improving our labor efficiency in the fresh departments.\nSo those were all, I think, tailwinds in the quarter that helped us offset some of the headwinds that we saw in gas margins in particular during the quarter and also the impact that we saw on the LIFO charge with the higher inflation in the back half of the year. I think in terms of thinking about it for the future, I would say really we tend not to focus on individual quarters because our goal obviously is to manage the business in the long term, I should say, and manage the business holistically. And so I think it's probably more relevant to look at the performance over a number of years and how we've been able to continue to grow the business and see a slight improvement in gross margin.\nAnd really, we look at the quarter and, as I mentioned earlier, of how we were able to balance the impact of tariffs and supporting our members while also maintaining a steady gross margin rate as well. I'll maybe let Ron talk a little bit about the assortment and what we're seeing there with some of the changes.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you, Gary. Exactly. It's not going to be a marked change in what you'll see in a Costco. Our buyers, when we were booking for this holiday season, really had to evaluate all the discretionary items, the toys, the trim, the decorations, and those kind of things, and made decisions based on the necessities and what they felt they needed to be in Christmas trees. But we really thinned down that whole category, and we thinned down a lot of the additional seasonal areas as well. What that provided us was the opportunity to bring in categories that we don't traditionally carry during that time of year.\nAnd so we're seeing some of that already when we're bringing in backyard sheds in the fall, which are doing very, very well for us, but we never had the ability to do that due to space restrictions.\nWe're bringing in saunas for your garage or your home who are also performing very well. High-ticket goods that are very relevant to the time of year, but not reflective of the traditional Costco set you'll see. You'll see some more furniture in the warehouses that we normally didn't do any furniture that time of year, but it says great opportunities for top-line sales.\nSo I feel really good about the way the buyers have pivoted on the discretionary items and said, \"Okay, how can we still be relevant in the time of year but with some new categories that we had not done before due to space limitations?\" So I still see it as a very exciting holiday season with some new goods that we haven't carried in prior years.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zihan Ma with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the membership fee side where you, I think Gary mentioned it's 7% growth excluding the price increase and FX. How sustainable do you think that trend is going to be, especially in the US and Canada where you're opening some of the fill-in stores in markets where the penetration may already be fairly high? Is there a risk of the membership fee income growth slowing down from here? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. You know we still remain very excited about the opportunities for continued growth in the membership base. We're obviously opening new warehouses every year, and Ron talked about that earlier in terms of the opportunity that creates to create a broader coverage of the geographies that we're operating in and driving new membership engagement.\nThe positive and opportunity side of the comments we made earlier about membership renewal rate with that younger generation of members now also experiencing Costco, we think creates continued opportunity to drive new member engagement in a broader range of the potential member base than we've historically seen prior to COVID.\nIf we look at the maturity of our warehouses and some of the warehouses that have been opened in recent years, and particularly in some of our international markets, generally speaking, we see continued growth in the number of members in those locations as those businesses and those warehouses mature over time as well.\nAnd of course, we're adding new member benefits all the time with the extended opening hours that Ron mentioned in the earlier comments, the Instacart benefits, and the 5% gas rewards on the credit card that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago. So we generally don't talk about sort of future projections, but I think we feel very positive about the opportunity to continue to grow the membership base.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nShervin Zand\n\nEquity Research Associate, Truist Securities\n\nHi, thank you. This is Shervin on for Scot. Kind of a piggyback on the memberships question. With it growing 6% in the quarter, is it possible that we're seeing the delayed benefits of people affected by the membership sharing like crackdowns, and can we see an acceleration from here? And outside of the existing memberships, are you seeing the new Executive Membership benefits driving a more favorable mix for new incoming members?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah, I think to the first part of the question, there's nothing we would see in the data that would say there's anything sort of happening relative to the change you referred to. And again, that was something that we found.\nCertainly during COVID, there was some change in behavior, and as we introduced the communication around the entry to the warehouse, that helped sort of make sure that our members were able to renew and update their memberships in an appropriate way. And that's been something that's really been flowing through now for some considerable time. So I wouldn't say there's anything that we point to in the volume of member sign-ups that we're seeing that we would believe is related to that particular activity that you mentioned.\nI think we have been really encouraged and pleased with the member reaction to the continued value that we're adding to the membership, the extended opening hours, and the Instacart benefits that we referenced earlier. And certainly with the growth that we've seen in the Executive Membership profile, typically what we see over time is those members are more engaged and they shop more frequently, and our goal is always to demonstrate more value for the member and encourage them to keep upgrading and getting more value from the membership from the Costco membership.\nSo in that regard, I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing, and it was part of the goal that we had when we introduced those benefits.\n\nShervin Zand\n\nEquity Research Associate, Truist Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you so much. That's very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline, and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Ron. Hey, Gary. My question is on e-commerce and specifically grocery. So there was this announcement from Amazon in the quarter around increased fulfillment capabilities. Can you talk about if you've seen a spike in your Instacart-driven traffic since then? I know you've added some benefits, so maybe it's hard to parse it out. And then can I ask if Costco has what you think is an optimal capability to meet what is increasing online grocery demand? Thanks.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. I mean, like you said, it's very tough to tell. The Instacart and Uber businesses continue to really do a very good business for us. It continues to grow at a good rate. And so we have seen the additional Executive Membership benefit be accretive to that. It's definitely helped it out quite a bit. We're very aware of new competition into this space, and we continue to watch that very closely. It comes down to the Costco items that are being delivered as well, too, which is a big driver from the consumer out there, is that they want the goods that we have at their home.\nIt may be a different way to deliver to them as opposed to coming into the warehouse, but there still is the desire for the fresh foods, which is a big driver for us in the food and sundry business that we have out there. So very aware of it. We're very happy with the growth of the business there, and we are seeing some strong growth in the back half of the year, and it's hard to tell exactly what that's coming from.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nAnd Simeon, you may have heard me mention at the end of the prepared remarks that we are going to include now those sales in our definition of e-commerce-enabled and digitally-enabled sales. So going forward from next month's monthly sales, you'll see those. You won't see those numbers called out, but those numbers will be included within our overall growth in e-commerce and digital.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline, and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOh, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of on the unit growth, the 30 for this year, 20 in the US, just curious the sustainability of that pace of growth. How long do you think you can kind of sustain that level of growth here? And where do you think you can get the international growth, unit growth, to over the next few years? And kind of related to that, maybe a sense for what the CapEx plan is for next year. I apologize if we missed that, but curious kind of what the spend plan is for next year in terms of total CapEx. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nAs far as the future growth, I'll touch on that part. Yes, we do see some runway. We've made an investment in our real estate group to make sure that we're looking at all the opportunities as our geographical footprint continues to broaden around the world. We want to make sure that we are indeed looking at these opportunities.\nFor a few reasons, we feel very good. The right opportunities have come both in existing markets to increase capacity and where we feel we can better serve those markets. We continue to still find in North America and internationally opportunities in new markets where we're doing very well. So we do see some runway as far as this 30 warehouses opening a year. We don't strive for a number. I mean, we're not going to make any bad decisions on opening warehouses to get to any set number.\nIt could ebb and flow. In some of the international countries, it takes us a little bit longer. You'll see some swings back and forth year to year when things come to fruition. Some projects could take us three years internationally where we have things that can turn much quicker in North America. Overall, I think we feel some good runway is out in front of us as far as growth goes. We have people ready to expand the company, and our operators have done a very good job dealing with the cannibalization we've dealt with in the existing markets we're in.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThen maybe to answer the question on capital expenditure, I'll just maybe take a step back on that as well and provide a bit more context on what we saw in fiscal year 2025 and how we think about 2026 as well for you. So I think generally when you look back at capital expenditure for us over the last few years, we've seen it grow. When you look at the compounded growth rate over the years, it's generally grown in line with sales. We did see in 2025, when you look at the total capital expenditure for the year, we grew capital expenditure at a faster pace than sales for the first time, actually, for a while for us.\nThat was really for the areas that we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks around the number of warehouses that we're looking to open in 2026, the remodel work that we're doing, the preparation of the depots for the expansion in warehouse sales and also e-commerce, and also some manufacturing opportunities to improve the value in Kirkland Signature. I would say as we think about future growth in 2026, those areas we think are opportunities for us looking forward as well.\nWe've already talked about the warehouse growth, but we do think with remodels, the opportunity to keep expanding our capacity in our warehouses, especially as the average warehouse now in the US and some of our more mature markets is around 20 years old. There's an opportunity for us to refresh and to support continued best-in-class service in those warehouses.\nWe think there's continued opportunities in manufacturing to support further growth in Kirkland Signature. We didn't really talk about it in prepared comments, but technology is also an opportunity for us to be able to deliver better member experiences and the growth in e-commerce and member engagement. So overall, we think those will continue to be good opportunities for growth.\nWe feel confident the returns on the investments that we'll make will be very strong as well. So we'd expect 2026 to have capital expenditure that would grow over 2025 and probably a little bit higher than sales again for the same reasons in 2026 as 2025. We typically actually give the CapEx number, I think, in our Q1 release.We'll give you a specific number in Q1 as we do every year, but I would expect it to be a growth again for the reasons I just mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks. A couple of questions. I want to circle back on inflation. Gary, I think you mentioned it was low single digits, maybe 2-ish%, last quarter, and now it's low to mid-singles. Could you just describe, is it non-food driving all that acceleration and sort of frame it magnitude-wise?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think last quarter, actually, we said overall low to mid-single digits, and we really kind of said the same this quarter. The change was really in Q3. Q4 has generally been pretty consistent with Q3. As we look at it and break it down by category, fresh and food and sundries are relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in that sort of low to mid-single digit range. There are lots of sort of puts and takes in there.\nWhen you look at individual departments, we certainly see meat and deli largely because of meat and candy would be more inflationary, whereas departments like produce and liquor would be either lower inflation or decelerating inflation or even deflation in certain items.\nOn the commodities front, we see acceleration in inflation currently in commodities like beef, coffee, sugar, and corn, but then also that's partially offset by, we're seeing some deceleration in produce, in particular in berries and avocados, and then eggs, butter, and cocoa are also slower inflation too. So there's lots of puts and takes in those food, sundries, and fresh departments. The change in Q3 really was in non-foods. But again, I would say it's really low single-digit inflation overall within non-foods, but the real change there was it had been deflationary for 12 months or so.\nSo that was kind of what drove, I should say, the change in Q3 and the reason that we updated our LIFO estimates because we'd seen continued inflation in food and fresh, but that was being offset by non-foods. Now with some inflation in non-foods, that's kind of changed the overall picture. It's still in that low to mid-single digit overall, I would say.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. My follow-up is we've just seen a lot of the credit card companies add perks and raise fees on their cards. I'm just sort of curious what trends you're seeing there in terms of penetration and any thought of ways to maybe enhance the member value on that front.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Well, for our credit card, it's an incredibly successful program for us, and we deliver a lot of incremental value to our members through the credit card with the rewards that we offer and some of the additional benefits around travel as well. We did recently make some changes to our credit card, recognizing that we felt there was an opportunity to accelerate the value and also to continue to grow that program. And so we added an incremental benefit where the member can now receive 5% rewards on gas. We also updated and modernized the card itself as well. And we've been pleased so far with the reaction from members and the continued growth in that program.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's great. Thanks and good luck.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on tariffs and the outlook for the gross margin around that. I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the impact of tariffs over the next few quarters, as it seems like there are retailers that are going to be taking more price. Is that something that you think you're going to be doing as well? How you're thinking about the elasticity associated with that? And I'm curious in terms of your competitive positioning. Do you plan to be offensive around this? Is it something that could have some incremental margin pressure in the coming quarters? Just any color around that would be great. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think overall, first thing to say, of course, is that the environment with tariffs does still remain fluid. There could still be changes that we have to address as the picture unfolds. But with the tariffs that we've seen and we're sort of managing, if you like, as things stand today, our teams, I think, have done a fantastic job in navigating what's been a very fluid and changing environment.\nAnd I think the benefit of us having buyers who have really been in the business for many years and understand the business well, that are managing with the limited SKU count that we have a low number of items per buyer. So they really understand the individual items that we're buying and the way those products are costed and constructed.\nWe can also, as Ron mentioned earlier, we have the flexibility to change items where we believe, if we don't see that the value would be there with the impact of tariffs, that we can move our assortment to items that really will deliver that value that our members have come to expect. I think we've also had the benefit of being a global retailer.\nSo with 30% of our business being international, it gives us the opportunity to work with our suppliers in offsetting some of these things by buying globally and also still supporting 30% of our sales to our warehouses that are international still are less impacted by some of those issues that we're working through. We've taken really a multi-pronged approach to it. There isn't a single answer of how we've managed tariffs.\nPart of it is that we have absorbed costs ourselves and challenged ourselves to offset those costs to protect the member by improving efficiency and lowering waste, spoilage, and those kind of things. We've also worked with suppliers to find offsets and efficiencies, and that includes buying more globally. There are examples there where we've been able to save 30% to 40% on the cost of items by consolidating to a smaller number of buyers and a smaller number of suppliers and bringing the cost down because of the volume that we can consolidate there.\nWe've also looked at sourcing from different countries and local production. You may recall last quarter we talked about, with KS laundry detergent. We were able to save 40% in Asia by moving production for the items that we're producing for those markets to be in the region.\nAnd we've rotated items, as Ron referred to earlier. So I think from what we know today, we feel like there wasn't a cliff for us. The impact was managed gradually by our teams doing all the things that we've mentioned. And we largely feel like we've worked through the strategies that we needed to mitigate what we see in front of us today. So we feel like the teams have done a very good job to position us to make sure we have the right assortment at the right value and deliver even greater value for our members.\nThe sort of caveat of everything I just said, of course, is that there may be changes still to come that we have to manage, and that's something that we'll have to be agile if that's the case.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nBut I would add to what Gary said, and I agree with everything he said. We're taking a very offensive approach to this where we're going to do everything we can to mitigate tariff impacts. And last effect would be we pass on price. And if we do that, we're going to be the last one to go up and always the first one to go down on any opportunities we have out there. So it is all hands are on deck, and we address this like we would any commodity increase, and we use the different tools we have to try and mitigate any price increase for any reason.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, Ron and Gary. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to ask about membership growth and total membership households that continue to increase in that 6% to 7% range year-over-year. Just two questions about that. One, is the right way to think about the components of that more like a low single-digit figure in the US and high single-digit internationally? And then as you think about the long-term US potential for household membership, what do you think or estimate that Costco has today in terms of percentage of US households that are members, and how high do you think you can take that over time?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Thanks, Kelly. I think it maybe comes back to a couple of the comments that I made earlier. We look at the growth that we've seen, and certainly it's a good reflection, I think, of the focus of all of our team here to say, how do we start every day thinking of how can we deliver more value for our members, and how do we show that the membership decision is the best decision that our members have made because of the value that they get from the membership with Costco?\nAnd really, our focus tends to be, I think, a little bit less on the way you phrased the question and more on how do we make sure that's always at the center of everything we do and continues to create new opportunities to grow our membership base.\nI think because of the focus there and some of the things that we talked about on the call about how the team is navigating tariffs to make sure we stay true to that, delivering the best value for the member as we're adding more membership benefits like the extended hours as we continue to open new warehouses and start to reach new member geographies. But also, as the maturity of those warehouses, as you know, we don't advertise as a company.\nWe believe that word of mouth and our existing members extolling the value they see from their membership is how we grow our base. There's an organic growth to our business because we're really focusing on ensuring how we deliver that continued value. We still think there's opportunity to continue to grow that base.\nIt would certainly be true that there's an opportunity in international markets to, and we typically, when we open in international markets, we see a larger number of new memberships in those markets because there's less awareness of Costco, and typically there's less sort of surrounding warehouses that could be impacted.\nBut on the other side of that, what we tend to see with warehouses in the US where we open and we're filling in markets, we see tremendously quick growth in sales in those areas because it's not only in the new warehouses, but we replace the sales in the affected warehouses because we're freeing up the capacity for those members to shop more frequently in the warehouse as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe a housekeeping question to start. So just on the incremental hours P&L impact, it sounds like it's going well. Good sales lift, and you're seeing good upgrades to Executive Members. As you look towards this fiscal year, do you expect it to be a net benefit, the benefits versus some of the expenses with the increase in employee hours?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. I think it's fair to say that, Rupesh. I mean, just kind of re-summarizing what we talked about earlier, as Ron mentioned, we've seen a positive impact in terms of overall sales in the US warehouses from the extended hours, and our operators have done a great job managing the impact from an SG&A perspective.\nSo we have the typical sort of headwinds from the employee agreement that we need to manage and leverage our sales, but we wouldn't be calling out any sort of major headwind from the SG&A perspective based on what a great job our operators have done to manage the impact.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then maybe just my follow-up question. I know, Gary, and alternative revenue streams, you guys have talked about successful media campaigns earlier this year. So just curious on any new efforts on the alternative revenue stream as we look toward this upcoming year.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. I mean, it's still very much in the early stages. When we talk about alternative revenue, for us, I think it's broader than media for sure. The question earlier that was asked around financial services and credit card, we think that's a continued strength in our business and an opportunity to continue to grow. We launched the Buy Now Pay Later product with the firm earlier in the year, which is doing well.\nWe have a tremendously successful travel business that delivers significant value for members and has strong growth in our overall model and delivering value for member and top-line growth in the company as well. And media then is another component of that. And I think our journey with media is that we're sort of on a two-pronged journey, I would say.\nOne is to build out the capabilities so that we can deliver more personalized, relevant messaging to our members. And that includes a unified single data platform where we stitch all of our information and data together and then build out the tools that allow us to deliver more relevant messaging at scale to our members. And as we're doing that, which is also really important to media, we're really kind of proving out the concept with our suppliers of the value of media within Costco.\nAnd that's why we shared the example as we sort of want to make sure that we're demonstrating how we can create future value as we build those capabilities. And that'll be a continuation over the next 12 months or so, and we'll certainly share more updates as we continue to make progress on that journey.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. Best of luck.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Rupesh.\n\nOperator\n\nPardon me. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nHey, guys. Two strategic questions for either one of you. Maybe, Ron, when you think about the B2B opportunity, how do you think about that, the size of that, whether it's through business centers or online? Because I know when you do reloads, some of those become business centers. We're likely to see an acceleration in business centers. And then secondly, when you think about markets where it's just taken longer to get real estate, is there an opportunity to use the balance sheet to acquire chunks of real estate, right, that you can then kind of develop over a period of time? And maybe that speeds the process up a little bit.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nCEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nOn the first question about business centers, yes, we think that there's some tremendous capacity. Especially, we have now six in Canada, and we're going to continuously really grow at a much quicker rate in Canada in the business centers. The US, we see great opportunities both in new markets as well as when we relocate a building to a larger facility.\nThe old warehouses serve a great purpose for us as far as becoming a business center because they have the right size, and parking is not an issue at that level because we deliver about 60% of the goods from our trucks out there as well. So we see a good runway for us, both US, Canada, and potentially international markets for the business centers as well. So that is it.\nAs far as looking at the additional property that we need to, we will take that into account if we have got to get into the right market and then how we can create value for any outparcels or additional properties that are nearby us that could open up opportunities for us to expand in the right place. So we are open to those opportunities as well.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Good evening. Thanks very much for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups. First follow-up is you've talked about cannibalization to comps for the last couple of months. Do you expect that to be a headwind throughout 2026? And then just on some of the questions around the inflation outlook, on the non-food side, based on what you're seeing in the business, do you expect non-foods inflation to kind of stay in this range for the next couple of quarters? Basically trying to understand, are we at some of the peak pressure, or could it get a little bit higher from here? Thanks.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks for the questions. On cannibalization, it's really a reflection of our continued investment in filling warehouses to really make sure that we're continuing to grow our overall sales in those markets and relieve some of the pressure in some of our busier warehouses. And so I wouldn't see any reason why that would change dramatically in the future because that's a strategy that's working for us well in terms of continuing to grow our overall sales and grow our overall profitability in the markets in which we operate.\nAnd then from an inflation point of view, I think, as I mentioned earlier, we think that from everything we see today on tariffs, we've been proactive in managing that. And so from everything that we're dealing with today, I think what you're hearing from us on inflation is how we see it at the moment. But the dilemma, as I mentioned earlier, is we can't really predict what might happen in the future around future tariffs or future pricing by other players in the market, if you like, or events. So that's obviously hard for us to predict. But I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything in our plans that would cause that to change significantly.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Understood. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, Gary and Ron. On the digital roadmap, there's been a lot of customer-centric innovation you've done. What's low-hanging fruit ahead that you're most excited about? And then on Kirkland Signature, which is iconic, what's next? Or is it just tweaks, or is it the similar strategy? Some of the language in this call leaning into KS, that's probably a product of the environment, but was there anything different about how you'll continue to amplify that and maintain how great it is? Thanks a lot.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Thanks, Oliver. On the first part of your question, you're right. We've spent a lot of time as a team focusing on how can we continue to invest in improving the digital experience and making it more convenient for members to shop. We've had some good progress in those areas. I think we continue to see opportunities to improve the member experience through the app and through the website, and particularly in investing in capabilities that deliver more targeted and relevant personal messaging for members. That's definitely one of the highest priorities that we're focused on.\nYou've heard us give a couple of examples of things that we're starting to do there, but should certainly expect to see more of those opportunities going forward to drive whether it's visits into the warehouse, or items in the basket, or more engagement online with our members for e-commerce sales.\nAnd then Kirkland Signature, I think just briefly on that, overall, our view on Kirkland Signature is that it's all about delivering quality, value, and innovation for members. And if we see examples where there are gaps for our members, where we think there's items that we can deliver that value and quality that doesn't exist today, then that's what we're doing and how we're innovating and delivering new products for our members. We don't have a specific target for Kirkland Signature. It really is about when there's that value and that opportunity there with the member.\nAnd of course, we love working with national brands as well to develop and grow those partnerships. But Kirkland Signature also provides a sort of healthy tension there to make sure that that value and quality is there for our members. We'll continue to innovate and grow those items where we think we can deliver that value for the member. It certainly, over the last few years, has continued to grow in penetration because of the great work our teams have done in building out those items and delivering that value for the member.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks a lot. Best regards. Maybe you should go to 24 hours, by the way.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWe'll take that into consideration.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session and today's call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

We have included a number of images in our slide deck this year. This one is the BUILD reservoir contract that we are now doing for Southern Water. This contract is a fairly new contract, so it is a recent picture. It has been in the news recently, absolutely critical to safeguarding the future supply of water to the southeast of England. This is part of a 12-year program of work that we are going to be doing with Southern Water through AMP8 and into AMP9. I am Alex Vaughan, Chief Executive of Costain, and I am going to take you through the operational review shortly.\n\nThen Helen Willis, our Group CFO, is going to take you through the financial performance and results of the business before I come back and give you a bit of an update on the strategy and the outlook that we have got for the business ahead. Then we will take a number of your questions. Again, this slide shows the work that we are doing up at Sellafield. We have been working with Sellafield for a number of decades now, and we are helping them with their decommissioning program. This is all a critical part of enabling the UK's new nuclear future by being able to decommission and deal with the waste from the past.\n\nYou will hear, as I go through the presentation, the growing position that Costain has built in that new energy market. I am incredibly proud of the hard work and effort and drive and dedication that the Costain team has put into executing the ambitious strategy that we have set out. This has resulted in an increase in operating profits and increasing margins in line with the targets that we have set out, and further growth in the forward work position of the business. All of that underpins our confidence for meeting expectations for this year and the step-change growth for the business in terms of revenues, operating profits, and margins in 2027. It has been another positive performance in the first half. Revenue is at £525 million, and we have had continued growth in natural resources.\n\nThis has been offset in transportation due to the expected ending of a number of road contracts that we knew was coming to an end. That is ahead of the new contract starting. We will see new contracts starting next year. We have got the new M60 contract and a number of highway schemes for Transport for London. We have also experienced the rephasing of the schedule on HS2. This is a short-term move in rephasing it, and we will be completing that work shortly in the future. I call it ebbs and flows of a business, but in the whole, a great performance.\n\nThe quality of the contract portfolio that we have been building and that we have now got, and the strong execution capability of the business has enabled us to deliver a 3% increase in adjusted operating profit and to deliver margins of 3.2% in the first half of the year. We remain on track to deliver 4.5% margins at a run rate in the second half of this year. Our net cash position remains strong, and we remain on track to deliver £170 million worth of net cash at the end of the year in line with the previous expectations.\n\nWith our very clear focus on growing markets, we continue to win a lot of new work and to add new customers to our portfolio as we continue to provide that essential infrastructure that the UK needs. We have expanded our forward work position to £5.6 billion, up from £5.4 billion at the year-end, more than four times our revenues of last year, pretty industry-leading by any measure. Bidding activities in our business remain incredibly high, and we are very confident that we are making further announcements in the second half of the year of additional work that we will have won. What is really positive is infrastructure investment is significantly increasing, and its prominence in the political world of the UK is growing.\n\nWe see real momentum in that work progressing. We have been very encouraged by the government's commitments in its 10-year infrastructure strategy and setting out its pipeline and the recent spending review. That bodes really well, and you will see that every one of our markets, Transport for London spend, defense, nuclear energy, and its contribution to energy, all of those markets, the investment is increasing, which is great. That, together with regulated increasing investment in water, energy, and aviation, underpins the clarity and confidence that we have in the growth of the business moving forwards. Through the growth in operating profits and margins, continued strengthening of the balance sheet, and the progression of our dividend alongside the share buyback program, we are creating substantial value for our shareholders and investors.\n\nGiven the very positive market outlook and the business resilience that we've clearly built, we're increasingly confident of delivering strong performance through 2025 and 2026, and for that step-change growth in adjusted operating profit and revenues in 2027 and beyond. These are really exciting times for us as a business. Now, if I move on to the operational performance, let me start with transportation. The photos on here show the work we're doing at Heathrow Airport in putting in place a new Terminal 2 baggage system, a critical starter for 10 for Heathrow Airport's expansion and redevelopment plans. The A30 highway scheme is transforming lives in Cornwall, especially in the summer when it seems to be the most popular place to go. The West Ruislip section of our HS2 program very soon will transform transportation connectivity in the UK.\n\nIn line with the business priorities, the transportation division is delivering operational contracts extremely well and continues to broaden its customer mix, both of those being a critical business driver for us, predictable best-in-class delivery and growth of our customer resilience. Looking forward, confidence in the growth is underpinned, as I said, by the government's 10-year infrastructure strategy, by its pipeline, and by the spending review. We can see those increasing investments starting to come through. Notably, clarity in the road schemes that are going to go ahead, and also the local and devolved transport spend that is significantly increasing, together with those bigger business plans for our aviation customers, Manchester Airports Group, Gatwick Airport, and Heathrow Airport. In road, we continued to deliver the programs of work that we've got as a strategic partner for National Highways, so the A30 contract in Cornwall, the A1 up near Newcastle.\n\nWe've also completed the M6 Smart Motorway program and 41 emergency areas on the M1. We've got a growing portfolio of work for Transport for London, whether that be the Gallows Corner project, the Brent Cross project, or the A40 Westway, that is growing. Looking forward, our M60 contract has now received confirmation of funding from the spending review and will be starting next year. We've also secured a place with National Highways on their SPAT3 framework, having successfully delivered a lot of work for them on their SPAT2 framework. That is where we provide technical and engineering consultancy services to help them in their strategic planning on the road network. We have really clear visibility of the future opportunities in that sector moving forward. In rail, on HS2, during the period, the last three TBMs have completed their drives.\n\nWe have now completed the connection from West Ruislip all the way through to Old Oak Common. All four tunnels have now been completed, and we were delighted that we completed those on budget and on time. In integrated transport, we have seen increasing growth as investment increases in the airports, and we see this as a real growth market for us moving forward. Overall, a really strong performance, and I am very grateful for the hard work of the transportation team. Natural resources is clearly benefiting from strong delivery performance again and significant investment in water, energy, defense, and nuclear energy. Revenue, profits, and margins have all grown as a result of the strong operator performance and the improving quality of the contracts that we have won and we deliver. The photos show the Horsham Wastewater project that we are working on and completing for Southern Water again.\n\nThe environment that we operate in, in upgrading the whole of the Cadent gas network in the east of England, a huge area and a big upgrade. Then the new contract we have won for Urenco, which is going to unlock the nation's nuclear energy future. In water, we have had an incredibly positive close to AMP7. We achieved 100% of the regulatory date commitments that we made to our customers and that our customers had made to the regulators. That is for over 100 projects. Our focus now is very clearly on successfully mobilizing AMP8, and we have good visibility of the contract pipeline from 2025 through to 2030. We continue to expect that doubling of investment in AMP8 compared to AMP7, and we are expecting high investment levels, even higher investment levels in AMP9.\n\nPositively, a number of our contracts for United Utilities, Northumbrian Water, and Southern Water extend into AMP9. You will have seen that water resilience is an absolute critical area of focus, whether it be reservoirs, etc. We were really pleased that in June, we announced a five-year extension to our Anglian Water program for the strategic pipeline. This project will bring resilience to the east of England. It gets less rain than Israel, quite staggering. We are building a pipeline that will transfer water from areas where there is plenty of water resilience to areas where there is very little water resilience. Also, during the first half of this year, really pleased that we have now turned on Tideway. We have commissioned it, it is now operational, and that is going to transform the health of the River Thames and safeguard London's growth for the future, a really important milestone.\n\nIn energy, our performance on the Gate Cadent framework continues to be fantastic, and we commenced the delivery of BP's landmark carbon capture and storage project at Teesside. Building on our extensive gas process expertise, we were awarded two design contracts for a new customer, Storage Energy, to develop the design for pioneering underground hydrogen storage projects in Cheshire. We see future growth in supporting the decarbonization of the UK's energy system as a great opportunity for us, both through gas distribution, where we have huge capability, but also through electrical transmission and distribution, where we are working and building a strong capability at the moment. Defense and nuclear energy continues to grow well, with our activities associated with the Continuous at Sea Defense program in defense. This is continuing to expand, and we are working around the nuclear decommissioning and nuclear asset life extensions as well.\n\nAs I said before, we are really pleased to, in the period, have added Urenco to our customer list, securing a complex program delivery partner contract with them for its Cheshire site, critical to providing the fuels that will support our new nuclear future, all part of the Great British Nuclear Drive for Change, to deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy. We have also won consultancy contracts to support the delivery of Sizewell C, and with DesNez, and bidding levels in this marketplace are really busy. Overall, we are really pleased that we have delivered another positive operational performance in the first half of this year. Growth in adjusted operating profits, growth in margins, and securing significant volumes of high-quality, long-term work.\n\nWe expect further progress in the second half of the year on the back of a very busy volume of bidding, and we are confident in delivering expectations for this year and for next year and for delivering that step-change growth into 2027. Helen.\n\nGood morning. First of all, just to show that even as a bean counter on the team, I know what we are doing. This picture is HS2. It is the Victoria crossover box. This is where we have launched the TBMs from, the tunnel boring machines. If you have not seen one, I have been lucky enough to be on one. They are over 100 meters long. It is like a huge manufacturing production line. It is quite something to see, and I just think it brings to light the scale and the complexity of what we do. I am really pleased to be here. Here we are again, delivering another strong set of results, as Alex Vaughan has been saying. We really are building momentum. We are increasing our operating profit. The margin is continuing to increase.\n\nThe forward work position is growing and the right quality, the right risk profile, all underpinning our confidence and expectations, a strong platform for growth. I will take you through the detailed slides. As Alex Vaughan has been saying, revenue of £525 million for the half, down from last year, with significant growth in natural resources, but offset by that expected reduction in transportation, as has already been covered. Adjusted operating profit up 3.1% to £16.8 million, in line with expectations, and reported operating profit up as well, 18% to £16.4 million. We saw continued margin improvement, with an adjusted operating margin increase of 70 basis points to 3.2% compared to 2.5% last year. We remain on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin run rate of 4.5% during the course of FY25, and that is in line with our ambition to deliver margins in excess of 5%.\n\nAdjusted basic earnings per share for the half was down very slightly at 5.5 pence against 5.6 pence in H1 24, and that is driven by a lower level of net finance income. We have enhanced shareholder returns with a significant increase, albeit a fairly modest interim dividend of one pence. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with net cash of £144.9 million at the end of the half, and year-end net cash expected to be around £170 million, in line with expectations after accounting for the share buyback. We have delivered a further increase in the high-quality forward workbook, which stands at 5.6 billion at the end of the half. Turning to revenue, this walk takes you through the movements in the two divisions.\n\nYou can see the two red bars there, the revenue reductions in road, as expected, driven by a reduction in National Highways schemes on certain projects where we are completing or nearing completion, partially offset by the growth in Transport for London. In rail, there were revenue reductions principally because of the previously mentioned resaving by the client to some of our HS2 program. There continues to be growth in integrated transport revenue, mainly reflecting the growing volumes at Heathrow Airport, where we support both our H7 terminal asset renewal partner and major project partner frameworks. In natural resources, a stable revenue in water as the water industry transitioned from AMP7 to AMP8 regulatory cycle, and our work nears completion on Tideway, as Alex Vaughan was mentioning. Typically, between AMP cycles, we have seen a period of reduced volume.\n\nHowever, the stable volume profile really demonstrates that we have had a positive close to AMP7, and water companies are beginning to scale up for AMP8. We also saw increased revenues in energy. We provide our customers in this sector with a range of services, including engineering design, managed services, and program management, solving our customers' complex needs. We delivered an increase in defense and nuclear energy revenues as well in the half, driven by growth in our current delivery partnership roles. Moving on to the operating profit walk, I will take you from left to right. The reported operating profit increased 18% from £13.9 million in the first half last year, and that is shown on the far left of the chart, to £16.4 million in H1 25, shown on the far right.\n\nAdjusted operating profit, shown in the light blue bars, grew by 3.1% to £16.8 million in the first half from £16.3 million last year. Adjusted operating margin increased, as I said, to 3.2% from 2.5% last year. Adjusting items, only £4.4 million, lower than the £2.4 million in the same period last year. Costs in H1 this year were comprised of £0.2 million, with residual costs of the transformation program that we completed last year, and £0.2 million of restructuring costs. Coming into the middle of the chart, divisional operating margin for transportation decreased by 0.8 points to 2.3% due to the previously mentioned lower volumes in road and rail. That is together with increased investment to support targeted growth opportunities. Natural resources operating profit increased to £16.1 million from £8.4 million in the first half.\n\nDivisional operating margin increased by 3.4 points to 7.7%, benefiting from higher volumes, improved contract performance, and successful contract finalizations as Costain Group PLC transitions from AMP7 to AMP8. Central costs increased by £0.7 million in the prior period, and that is driven principally by increased share-based payment costs. Net finance income in H1 2025 decreased by £1.8 million as compared to £3.1 million last year. This was driven by £2.6 million of interest income from bank deposits, lower than H1 2024 of £3.5 million, reflecting lower bank deposits and interest rates. Costain Group PLC also incurred £1.1 million of interest payable on bank facility fees, which is higher than £0.7 million in the previous period, and that is reflecting the accelerated amortization of charges relating to Costain Group PLC's prior refinancing.\n\nThe interest income on net assets or the pension scheme was slightly higher than H1 2024 at £1.5 million due to a higher pension scheme asset position over the year. Interest expense on lease liabilities was £1.2 million under IFRS 16, higher than H1 2024 due to the higher charges on new property leases entered into during the prior year. The balance sheet continues to strengthen, with net assets increasing from £235.7 million at December 2024 to £243.5 million at June 2025. Non-current assets have decreased on the prior period and position, driven by a small increase in the retirement benefit asset, which is more than offset by other non-current assets, which are lower than FY2024, largely reflecting depreciation on Costain Group PLC's fixed assets. Trade stables and other current assets increased on FY2024 position, driven by higher contract asset positions.\n\nTrade payables and other liabilities decreased on FY2024, largely due to a reduction in subcontractor accruals. The cash walk, again, I will lead you through this left to right. You will see on the left, net cash of £158.5 million at the beginning of the period, moving to the far right, £144.9 million, closing net cash at the end of the half. The first bar represents cash flow on adjusting items of £0.4 million, as I just mentioned. Adjusted free cash flow of £3 million outflow is shown in the next area, the boxed area. This cash flow reflects the timing-driven working capital flows around the period end. Costain Group PLC also incurred a nominal £0.1 million on CapEx.\n\nThe next bar represents net asset receipts in the year of £0.5 million, lower than our net financing income on payment of accelerated arrangement fees on the prior refinancing, as I just mentioned. It is worth noting that the operating lease expenditure is shown separately from cash on operations and was £4.8 million for the half. Our dividend payments totaled £4.9 million, following the increased final dividend declared FY24. Lastly, we also acquired £1 million of treasury shares during the half. We expect our FY25 year-end net cash position to be around £170 million, in line with our prior expectations after taking account of £10 million share buyback program and higher dividend payments. In line with the agreed reduced deficit contribution plan with the trustee of the group's defined benefit pension scheme, we made no contributions to the scheme during the half.\n\nAn assessment of the scheme funding position was carried out in March 25, and as the funding level was more than 101%, contributions remained paused from July 25 to June 26. These contributions would have amounted to £3.4 million for the period should the scheme funding level have been less than 101%. Excuse me just a moment. I seem to get cold for half years. Finally, I am happy to announce that we have been reconfirmed as one of the top fastest paying lead contractors in construction, paying 97% of invoices within 60 days. That is a critical factor in supporting our quality supply chain. Moving on to cash and banking facilities, and just to pull out the elements of it, the net cash position at the end of H1 25 comprised Costain cash balances of £85 million, cash held by joint ventures of £59.9 million, and borrowings of nil.\n\nDuring the half, the group's average month-end net cash balance was £149.4 million, which is shown on the left on the chart, and the average weekend net cash balance was £152.9 million. You can see a real consistency in the way we manage our cash. During the half on May 28, 2025, the group announced that it had successfully concluded negotiations with its bank insurity facility providers to refinance a new four-year agreement of its bank and bonding facilities to September 29, with an option to extend by a further year. The group's new facilities agreement replaces the previous three-year facilities agreement to 2026 and comprises a £100 million revolving credit facility, which was previously £85 million, and surety and bank bonding facilities of £295 million, previously £270 million. The existing banking group remained, and we were really pleased to be able to add another bank to the group.\n\nThere is a further increase, as we have mentioned, to our forward work position, which stood at £5.6 billion at the end of the half, representing more than four times our annual revenue from last year. We have been busy building, and the forward work has continued to grow: £4.3 billion at H1 2024, £5.4 billion at full year 2024, and now at £5.6 billion for the end of the first half of 2025. We continue to bid and continue to see opportunities to further increase this position. The forward work position is built on long-term programs. It enables us to deliver high consistency, continuity, and quality of work for our customers.\n\nAt the end of H1 2025, really importantly, it included no single-stage lump sum contracts and was predominated by target cost contracts where the scope of the work, design, and cost are developed and agreed with the client. That is to say, the forward work consists of the right risk profile to ensure predictable delivery of results. Our order book stood at £3.4 billion at the period end, up from £2.5 billion at the end of FY2024. The preferred bidder book stood at £2.2 billion at the end of the half, down from £2.9 billion at the end of FY2024, as work won shifts into our order book.\n\nIt comprises contracts for which we have been selected on frameworks where a further works order is required prior to the works commencing. It is important to also note that some of our framework and consulting revenue is not included in the order book or the preferred bidder and therefore is incremental. This, together with existing frameworks, gives us increasing visibility and confidence in delivering progress in FY2025 and 2026, with a step-change growth in performance in both revenue and profit from FY2027 and beyond. As I mentioned before, we have transformed our business. We have transformed it in terms of assured delivery, lower risk contracts in our forward work, improved operational excellence, cost control, and a broader business mix. This has driven the quality of the forward work, the right risk profile, the right contractual terms, and hence the right conditions for predictable delivery of results.\n\nWe continue to invest in the business to bring in the skills needed to drive improved performance across the entire business and across the contract duration. Some examples of what we've been up to this first half. We've continued to improve the quality of the finance team, reaching deeper into the projects, bringing new challenge into contract delivery. We've invested in and are implementing a risk system that takes a view of risks from projects all the way through to corporate risk, hence digitalizing our risk practices. We further enhanced our operational controls, particularly in the area of integrated project controls. This focus drives the path to higher margins, as demonstrated by continued margin progression, and you can see us increasing from the prior period.\n\nWe've delivered a further year of margin improvements, up 40 basis points to 3.4% in the half year, and we remain on track to deliver adjusted operating profit margin of 4.5% during FY25. Costain continues to perform, as hopefully you have heard from our presentation today, against its strategic targets and expects to deliver long-term sustainable value for its stakeholders. Costain is investing for growth. Our cost base continues to prioritize investment in capabilities and expertise to support growth. We will continue investment in key systems as we digitalize the business, further accelerating our business transformation. We expect to invest around £10 million in CapEx across FY25 and '26 in these areas. The board recognizes the importance of dividends for shareholders and has been increasing the dividend payout since its resumption in 2023.\n\nDividend payments take into account the cash flow generated in the period and the impact of the current dividend parity arrangement relating to the defined benefit pension scheme. The board has a target dividend cover of three times adjusted earnings, which provides headroom for further dividend growth to achieve the target cover level, as and when the current dividend parity arrangement is no longer in place. In line with the board's dividend policy and the previously stated intention to normalize H1, H2 dividend split to a 33.67% ratio, an interim dividend of a penny per share has been declared for the six months ended June 30, 2025, a significant increase compared to the prior period interim dividend of 0.4 pence per share. I mentioned in an earlier slide that pension contributions have stopped for the year, as the funding level of the scheme at March 25 was more than 101%.\n\nThis also means that dividend parity with the pension scheme was suspended for a further year from July 25 to June 26. A further annual evaluation will be carried out as of March 26, which will enable the board to review future capital allocations. We continue to review options for restructuring the defined, excuse me, the defined pension scheme with a new sole trustee. After ensuring a strong balance sheet and cash position, identified surplus capital will be returned to shareholders through share buybacks and special dividends. On June 16, 25, the group launched a £10 million share buyback program, which completed on August 15, 25. That followed a £10 million share buyback program that was announced and completed on H2 24. As you can see, there is real momentum in our chosen markets of transport, water, energy, and defense and nuclear energy.\n\nA high quality and volume of our forward work, together with growth on existing frameworks, gives us good visibility on future revenue and profit. We have already approximately 90% of our forecast revenue for FY25 secured at the end of H1 25, and our bidding levels remain high. We remain on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin run rate of 4.5% during the course of FY25, in line with our ambition to deliver targets, margin targets in excess of 5%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, our net cash of £144.9 million, and our year-end net cash expectations of £170 million, and the increasing level of our interim dividend and the completion of our share buyback program. All this makes us confident in delivering our progress in FY25 and FY26, and that step-change growth in revenue and profit for FY27. With that, I will hand you over to Alex.\n\nThank you, Helen. I am now going to give you an update on the strategy and business outlook. This photograph shows the contract I was talking about earlier. This is Gallows Corner for Transport for London, where we are going to be removing, or we have removed already. If you live locally, you will be feeling it. We have removed the flyover and we are replacing it with a much stronger, sturdier flyover, and we are reconfiguring the whole gyratory system there, all part of Transport for London's plans about improving connectivity into London. We are delivering against a very clear strategy for the growth and development of Costain, which, with our customers and our partners, will create a sustainable future for the UK, a more prosperous UK, a more resilient UK, and a decarbonized UK.\n\nWe are focused on markets where strategic long-term investment is being made to meet these needs. That is across transportation, water, energy, defense, and nuclear energy. Investment to meet these critical national needs, as I have said earlier, is increasing, and in every one of our chosen markets, we see significant opportunities for us to grow in line with that increasing investment, but also for us to increase our market share. We purposefully only work with Tier 1 customers who choose to work with their partners in long-term strategic partnerships, where Costain can build a real depth of relationship and maximize the value that we add to them. We deliver both capital programs as a contractor and provide valued consultancy services through our broad expertise. This strategy will deliver growth in revenues, operating profits, and margins in line with the stated targets we have got.\n\nIt will strengthen the balance sheet as we focus on growing in those critical markets, working in strategic long-term partnerships with our customers, and providing that broader service offering to meet our customers' changing needs. Our chosen customers in our markets predominantly operate through underwritten and committed five-year business plans, and they choose to work with us in five-year programs, sometimes, like in the water industry this year, ten-year programs. For us, this is a really positive market dynamic. What is making Costain successful and will drive our growth is three Cs. The first C is continuity. This is continuity of the relationships we have and where we work and how we work with our customer, critically important for long-term growth.\n\nThe second C is consistency. What is positive is that we have got an increasing forward work view. We are able to see five years' work ahead, and we have the continuity and consistency to be able to deliver that. The third C is collaboration. Every one of the contract forms that we work with with our customers is a collaborative form of contract where we jointly work together to develop the solution, work together to mitigate the risks, and then agree what we are then going to go deliver and execute. That is a critical enabler for us to drive margin growth and revenue growth and operating profit growth in this business.\n\nThese markets and our customers' committed investment programs are increasing significantly and are enabling us to broaden our offer. I have talked before about the government's 10-year infrastructure strategy, an increase in road investment, increase in rail investment, increase in energy investment, and an increase in nuclear energy investment as they establish the Great British Energy. We also see increase in defense spending, which has been well publicized, and we are seeing that across our programs. Ofgem has approved the first £24 billion of their REO3 program, with another £80 billion to go. There is huge investment in the energy space. Heathrow Airport, Manchester Airport, and Gatwick Airport, all of them are talking about significant airport growth, aside from their design plans awaiting government approval to add a few runways here and there. But clearly, massive investment going ahead in the airport sector.\n\nAnd of course, the water industry is now well into the biggest capital investment ever made in water, and with over £100 billion worth of investment, and we know that AMP9 will be even bigger than that. So we continue to develop a track record, as you can see, for securing positions with our customers on these long-term frameworks and for attracting new customers to fall in love with COSTAIN GROUP PLC through these cycles. And this is helping us build that growth for the business. We bring together a unique mix of experts. We are a very different organization who have a broad range of delivery expertise, where, depending on our customer's approach, we act as both construction and consultancy partners. Today, we are a business that works with our customers to shape and create their solutions.\n\nWe do that for people like Network Rail, for the Department of Transport, National Highways, Transport for London, water customers, clean energy customers, and others, where we implement design solutions. We are also able to bring in our project controls and program management services to help them shape their programs. We also expertly support the delivery of new infrastructure, primarily as a leading contractor, but also increasingly as a leading delivery partner or program manager for our customers' organizations. We also help our customers operate, optimize, and repurpose their existing infrastructure. For example, we have been helping a number of water customers to really optimize the performance of their water assets, their clean water assets, to help deal with the beautiful climate that we have had recently. We are uniquely focused, as a business, on our customers' whole ecosystem.\n\nOur conversation is not just about what your capital delivery requirements are. Our conversation is around what your broader business needs and challenges are that we can help you with. That is helping us grow as a business and help us transform our customers' business performance. As I have said, we support many of our customers in the delivery of their capital programs. As a contractor, we are helping customers across Thames Tideway, road contracts, nuclear energy contracts, moving into the HS2, the AMP8 programs, aviation, and for our devolved customers, a huge amount of work as a leading contractor. We are a growing consultancy business, which now generates around 16% of our revenue and has three very different capabilities.\n\nFirstly, we are growing our position as a delivery partner, and you will have seen that we announced the award of the contract for Urenco, which joins the work we are doing for AWE, for Cadent, for BP, for Babcock, all of which we are running their capital programs for them. Secondly, we are growing our design and engineering capability, where we design solutions for our customers. Then thirdly, how we support our customers, as I have said, to help them optimize their overall business performance. As a result of our focus on those critical markets and broadening our customer base, we have expanded our strong forward work position, which this slide shows you, to 5.6 billion, over four times the annual revenues of this business. As I have said before, we remain incredibly busy bidding further programs of work.\n\nWe have strong positions with a growing number of Tier 1 customers across all of our sectors, with an increasingly broader service line. The quality of our forward work position is a result of a rigorous approach, as Helen Willis said, to contract selection and the expertise that we have in our key markets and the broader business service that we provide. In final summary, the improved quality of our contract portfolio, broader customer and service mix, and enhanced business resilience is driving our confidence in delivery of our results for full year 2025 and our medium-term expectations for growth. As I've said, and I hope you've got across, there is real momentum in this growing investment in infrastructure in all of our target markets. There is greater clarity of it. We've got the details, the government's behind it, the regulators are behind it. It's happening, and we're very excited.\n\nSet against this improving market outlook, we've been able to increase further the high-quality forward work position to £5.6 billion, and I'm very encouraged that there'll be further announcements in the second half of the year. We retain a very strong balance sheet with £145 million worth of net cash, which is enabling us to continue to invest in this business for growth and to be able to increase returns to our shareholders. Bringing this all together, we remain confident in the further progress of the business, how we will deliver this year, next year, and step-change the growth in operating profits, revenues, and margins for 2027 and beyond. Thank you very much, and we'll take your questions.\n\nThanks. Angus Lee Lamming from Invest Tech. I think I have three, actually, please. First, I want the working capital, just maybe a bit more color there. I assume, given you are maintaining your full-year expectation for net cash, is that all time in? Is there no change to kind of cash conversion or anything underlying that? Second question, just on the natural resources margin in H1, obviously good margin. Maybe a bit more explanation around that finalization of AMP7, what boosted the margin. Do you expect that to also occur in the second half? Last question, just on the step change in FY27, if you just remind us the main drivers there, is that mainly the margin, improved management, and is it the water? What is kind of giving you the visibility and confidence there?\n\nDo you want to do the first thing? I will do the first thing. Yes, so working capital, very much timing over the half year. So confident in that £170 million by the end of the year, which is in line with expectations. We talked about four years, so it is £180 less, the impact of the share buyback and increased dividend. The real increase at the half year is contract assets, so they will unwind in the second half. Then you will see that there is an H2 bias to profit and therefore cash in the second half. So no concerns on the balance sheet items at the half, very much timing differences through the half, which will unwind in the second. Natural resources margin, so yes, very high in the first half. I would expect the second half to be similar.\n\nThe major driver in there is in the water sector. So we have talked a lot about our cautiousness in revenue and profit recognition. As that plays through, you would expect at the end of contract there to be upside rather than downside. You really are seeing that in the water sector now. As we close out AMP7 into AMP8, you have got a real concentration of those contract closings that are giving us upside. So I would expect the second half to be similar to the first half. Then as we get into next year, I would expect it to come back to a more normalized level as we are into sort of the midst of delivery, particularly in water.\n\nYeah, if I look at 2027, what is going to drive that? A big underpin is the quality of the contracts that the business now has in its portfolio and the assured way that we deliver those contracts. That is a really important underpin, which is why we are consistently now delivering the margins that we are delivering. The second thing is just the growth in the forward work. We have grown a significant volume. We have the clear visibility of that work, which is great for us to be able to plan on. Also, you have seen that we have grown the consultancy business as well. That really helps us from a margin point of view to deliver that growth. That is the second thing. The third thing is just the visibility we have got on the other work that we would expect to secure as well.\n\nVery clear visibility of that, and actually some of it we are making pretty good progress on. Those would be my three things.\n\nThank you. Jerry Brent from Family Leave, I have got three questions as well. So, I think following on nicely from that, you have referenced several times potential work winning in the second half. Could you give an indication of what sort of areas we might expect to see that work winning? Secondly, I think consensus assumes some EBIT growth in the second half over the first half, but also over last year. Could you give us an indication of where that second half improvement comes from? And thirdly, you talked about options for the pension fund. Could you just elaborate what those might be?\n\nOh, it is goodness, you are getting the lion's share. Let us hit the first one and you can do the other two. Look, this is going to sound a bit, you would say this, wouldn't you? But the bidding activity is across every single one of our markets, incredibly, even further work in water, even after having won a huge amount of work already. All of our sectors are incredibly busy, and we would expect to make announcements. We are certainly seeing very high volumes in the nuclear energy space at the moment, and also across transportation. There is quite a lot going on. There is a lot going on in aviation, a lot going on in roads, and then water. You know, we continue to explore for new opportunities to unlock greater value there.\n\nThose would be the areas, and you know, it is a great market to be in. We are well placed.\n\nProfit expectations, consensus operating profit for the full year is circa £46 million, and we are confident in delivering that. It is, as I said before, very much H2 weighted. There is some volume impact into the second half, and there are also some of those contract closeouts that I was referring to, giving us a real uplift to profit and cash in the first half. I think some people have said to us, isn't that just one-offs? The answer is, in our view, no. This is really the consequence of the caution that we have applied in our revenue and profit recognition over the years. As contracts come to their completion, you get the upsides coming through. Our plans are detailed, and we are very confident in them, and therefore confident that we will reach that consensus number.\n\nWe talked at the full year about pension fund, we have obviously been giving you the details of the annual checks, which has given us some optionality. We are now knee-deep in the triennial valuation, hoping to complete that before next March, the full year results there. We are looking at all options, as you might expect, including buy-in, buy-out, but those have become more expensive over the last few months. We are working well and collaboratively with our sole trustee to get the best possible outcomes for the company. More to say on that come the full year results, hopefully.\n\nGood morning, Andrew Nussy from Peel Hunt. A couple of questions, please. First of all, in terms of HS2, I think you used the phrase, they are still being rephased. What visibility do you have on that process and the likely movement there? Associated with that, are there any issues around the supply chain, given that lower level of volumes versus what you still are committed to deliver near term? For Helen Willis, just obviously in terms of those AMP7 completions, profit back-ended, should we expect the same sort of contract structures for AMP8 in terms of the profit recognition, please?\n\nThanks, Andy. On HS2, clearly, it's been well publicized. They've been doing a new integrated program to complete the railway. As a result, for the section of work that we're working on, they've looked to exploit the opportunity to rephase some of that and focus on some of the other areas. That is a short-term rephasing and will be then delivering that work in a couple of years' time. That isn't causing us any issues with the supply chain. We're able to manage our way through those changes.\n\nSo, contract construction. We have been working very hard, as we have been explaining over the last few years, on understanding the risks that we take on in a much deeper way and working on how we transfer the risk between contractor and client and working on our T's and C's. As we moved into AMP8, where we were extremely successful with our wins and gaining some market share, we were able to use the demand from those water companies to tighten up those T's and C's, I would say. The construction is by and large the same, but the terms and conditions and the risks that we have taken on are better for us. We believe it is more balanced. Therefore, we should expect to see better delivery coming out of the AMP8 contracts.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, morning. It is Ed Price from Bamberg. Firstly, on margin, you have suggested that you are on track for the 5% plus target beyond 2025. Is it reasonable to think that that could become a full-year target rather than a run rate as you go beyond that? Secondly, quickly on mix, 64% in H1, is that reasonable going forward or do you expect transport to revert to higher levels? On contract size, I know HS2 and Tideway have been very large. Are you able to give us a sense of what sort of average contract size in your order book is?\n\nShall I do the first one?\n\nYep. I'll let you do the first two.\n\nThe first two.\n\nIt's a sort of theme.\n\nSo, margin, we set the margin milestones, I think two and a half, getting on for three years ago, 3.5% in FY24, the 4.5% during FY25. Thinking about those as second half margins, you can see from where we have got to with 3.4% in the first half, if you look at consensus, that suggests full year, therefore, will be beginning with a full. We are reasonably confident of that. Industry leading on its own at 4%. We will continue to push. We will continue to push for us to be more efficient. We will continue to push for the better risk transfer. As we grow, as the volume comes through, there is operating leverage that will help that as well. Could we get to 5% for the full year? That is certainly a possibility, but I would not say it is coming straight after FY25.\n\nAll of our plans show us progressing as we have been over the last three years. The mix, I think, transportation will be similar for the second half. We do think that there will be growth coming back into FY26 and definitely into FY27. Natural resources will be fairly steady, H1 on H2. There is more coming through in transportation, as Alex Vaughan, you were describing. So, really kicking into things like the N60, HS2 volumes will come through in FY26. Integrated transport is where there is real growth opportunity with the aviation contracts. I think overall there should be more positive news coming through there.\n\nComing to the contract size bit, I think we do not quote that because, as you know, HS2 would be very distorting. HS2 is a very big one-off program, which we have been involved with. The current contract that we, if you look at the contracts, we have won seven contracts on the HS2 program, and we continue to deliver that. If you look at water, you range anything from a £6 million project up to a £100 million project in those programs. We deliver those for all the water companies. If I look at what we do in the nuclear energy space from a decommissioning point of view, it is lots of £2 million to £14 million contracts. Defense and nuclear energy, where we are the delivery partner, our contracts are reasonable in size, but they are program management.\n\nIf you look at what we are running, we are running multi-billion pound programs for the client, but our contracts would be in the £60 million to £70 million pounds worth of work. That gives you a bit of a flavor. We do not really quote because I think we would have to give a bit more detail by sector for people to understand it.\n\nThanks. Johnny Cooper from Deutsche Numis. Just to clarify, you have guided to a step up in revenue, revenue growth, margins, and EBIT in FY27. Does that mean that you expect all of those to improve in FY26 and then they?\n\nDo you want to speak?\n\nYeah.\n\nI thought there would be three.\n\nI thought there'd be three as well.\n\nI can ask them all at the same.\n\nGreat question then.\n\nSo 2027 is definitely revenue and profit growth. There should be margin improvements through 2025, 2026, 2027, as I was just describing. Fiscal Year 2026, definitely operating profit growth coming through, and I would anticipate some modest revenue improvement as well.\n\nThanks. Just on that point, on the margins, what do you view as sustainable margins across each of the divisions? I mean, you mentioned contract gains this year.\n\nI think if you look at the margins achieved for FY24, 3.5% in transportation and circa 6% in natural resources, that feels like a steady state. As I say, there will be operating leverage coming through as we grow in 2027 and beyond. That will help to further increase.\n\nThanks. The third one, the last one, is to be a follow-up on the working capital. It said in the statement there was a bit of a working capital unwind on lower volumes. What do you think the sustainable level of negative working capital relative to revenue should be going forward? Also, is it more weighted towards transportation in terms of that working capital effect?",
    "content2": "The working capital effect is across both divisions. For example, in natural resources, as we close out those contracts, some of that profit is pushed into H2 and therefore cash. In transportation, there are a number of contract closeouts as well, and those will kick into H2. I think it really is a function of the number of contracts that we are in that sort of closeout process, and hence how it straddles the half year. I am confident that it will unwind and support that 170 at the end of the year.\n\nHi there, Max Hayes and Caviness. Just a couple of questions for me. A notable increase in the consultancy revenue mix. Just wondering what levels do you expect this to settle at? Does revenue from construction contracts grow and the potential impact on margins if that lowers as a share? Then just the £10 million of CapEx that you discussed for over FY25 and FY26, is that just primarily focused on digitizing the risk management and the benefits to be gained from digitizing that? Is that securing margins? Is that potential for expanding them? Just some more color there.\n\nWell, if I take the first one and then you take the second one. I mean, we now give the consultancy share of the revenue. That allows you to work out what the size of that consultancy business is. Will it remain that percentage, or will it increase, or will it decline? That will depend on the mix of the business. Certainly, as we get into AMP8, we would see construction work going up. As we get into the systems contracts on HS2, again, that will be construction volumes going up. We will be also increasing the consultancy. So, in real terms, as a unit, it will be increasing in volume. The really big value is those delivery partner contracts where we have big teams there for a long time supporting and basically acting as the client's organization.\n\nWe are making really good progress under Jonathan's leadership, who is here, to turn around and grow that design and engineering. That really is moving forward at a great pace. We are doing a lot more designing engineering for ourselves where we can actually charge a fee into the client for doing that, but also where more and more clients are buying that direct from us as a consultancy business. We have big impact, big ambitions in that area.\n\nSo, digital transformation or digitalizing ourselves, which I have been taught is the correct term, but it is absolutely not. This is, I think, a really exciting area for us. The £10 million is an estimate for 2025-2026. We have brought in a transformation lead who has done this in other places. We think there is a really exciting opportunity for us to properly digitalize how we deliver the work that we do. I think it will differentiate us in the markets. The £10 million is not just a risk system. It is across a number of things. If I just remind you, we invested in the HR system last year, which took six systems down to one.\n\ndeficiencies, but also given us much more visibility on our people and their skills and where we move them. Risk, as I said, is giving that transparency to our risk practices. What we are moving into now is really the heart of how we deliver. I could bang on about this for a long time, but I think this is not about peripheral systems. We will get onto those, but this is about how we really digitalize the activities when we are on the ground delivering the work that we do. That will give us better data, more visibility, should drive better delivery certainty and outcomes. I think for us, if we do this right, and I believe we are gathering the right people around us to do this, it could be a real differentiator for us. It is a very exciting space.\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nThank you. We have a number of questions from the webcast. First question is, given the very strong net cash position, what are the considerations of increasing the buyback program?\n\nSimilar to how we described it the full year, I think it is great. The balance sheet is stronger. The net cash position is strong. There are a few factors to consider in whether we carry out further buybacks or choose to do a special, for example. First off, we have a three-times dividend policy, so we are mindful that that needs to be moved towards. We also have, I think it's important to recognize the liquidity of our cash. As I pulled out, there's what we call Costain cash, which is fully liquid for us. It's the 85 million, but then cash held in joint ventures. It's our cash, but it's not fully liquid. When I'm thinking about how much cash do I need, it's the Costain cash of 85 that's important. Lastly, the dividend parity with the pension scheme. That is still in place.\n\nWe put the annual check in place. It gave us optionality year on year. But until we have been able to remove that from the agreements with the trustees, we're mindful of that and we need to be cautious of what we commit to until such times as we remove that parity clause. We're making good progress. You know, return to dividend. We've done the share buyback this year and last year, and those shareholder returns are much, much increased. We're working on the triennial, as I said, hopefully with some conclusions by the time we come back at the full year. We should be able to be a bit more fulsome on that at the full year.\n\nis great. Thank you for that, Helen. Next question is from Dan Hong from East River Holdings. Regarding the cash held by joint ventures, does it get released at some point? How does it work?\n\nYes, it does get released. It is with a small number of substantial joint ventures. It is held as we earn profit through the joint venture. We receive the cash from the customer, and then there are rules in all of the joint venture agreements as to how that cash is then distributed out to us as joint venture partners. The cash is always cycling. You will see it has come down a little bit as we have concluded some, or beginning to conclude the tie-away program, for example. You will start to see the balances come down.\n\nNext question is from Stephen Rawlinson. It says, \"The text states, 'This forward work position is built on long-term programs that enable us to deliver high consistency, continuity, and quality of work for our customers. This constant revenue is not present today. What might we expect in the future in each key area, especially as revenue and transport is expected to be lower in H2?'\" I think in answering Stephen's question, clearly the forward work position that we have is what we have already secured and have visible. That is supporting the growth. There is a lot of further work that we are working on and actively bidding at the moment, as I said earlier, in all of our sectors. If I look at roads, we can see a big pipeline of opportunities that we want to go at.\n\nAviation, we have talked about, there are a number of opportunities we are pursuing that we would be hopeful on. Further water work, nuclear energy, very, very active, very busy bidding at the moment, opportunities in energy. There is a large pipeline, billions and billions of pipeline that we are bidding at the moment that we would hope to add to that. I think if you look at the volume of forward work we have secured, that is pretty significant by any measure for a business of our size that will enable us to grow. Another question from Dan Hong. What is the full year 2025 revenue, profit, and margin guidance?\n\nwill give you the profit and margin guidance. Profit I mentioned earlier is £46 million operating profit. If you look at consensus, that means that the margin will begin with a 4. It will be 4.1 or 2. The revenue will be relatively equal, half spun on half 2.\n\nOkay, thanks very much. We have no further questions at the moment. Alex, I will hand back to yourself for any closing remarks.\n\nOkay, look, thanks very much for all of you taking your time. As you can see, we are very excited with the progress that we are making, but we have got a lot of opportunity ahead that we have got to go and grab and capture. We look forward to updating you again in six months' time. So, massive thank you. Have a good rest of your day. Above all, keep safe. Thank you."

My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Q3 2025 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Costco's Q3 2025 earnings call. I'd like to start by reminding you that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.\nThe risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nComparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not intended as substitutes for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Before we dive into our financial results, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is joining us again for today's call. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we wrap up the Q3 of fiscal 2025, let me make a few brief comments on some of the highlights. Since our last earnings call, we've opened nine warehouses, including relocation in Melbourne, Australia, our 37th warehouse in Japan, and seven net new US locations.\nWe plan to open another 10 warehouses during the Q4, which will include our second warehouse in Sweden, our 20th warehouse in Korea, and our 110th warehouse in Canada. For this fiscal year, we expect to open 27 new warehouses, including three relocations, for a total of 24 net new buildings. This will bring our total warehouse count to 914 worldwide.\nOur merchandising and operations team did a fantastic job in the quarter, delivering some strong financial results while also maintaining our competitive price position despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Capitalizing on the focus and scale we are able to achieve through our limited SKU count and global footprint, we continue to increase the overall value of our membership, including extended gas station opening hours and lowering prices on some key items such as eggs, butter, and olive oil.\nThe combination of expanded gas station hours, new gas station openings, and lower prices at the pump have led us to having two of our all-time highest gas weeks in the US during the last month. In times of consumer uncertainty, our Kirkland Signature brand is uniquely positioned to provide our members with great quality and great values.\nDuring the Q3 sales of Kirkland Signature items again outpaced our overall sales growth, with our KS sales penetration up approximately 50 basis points year over year. We continue to move more Kirkland Signature product sourcing into the countries or regions where the items are sold, and this has helped bring us to lower costs and mitigate some of the potential impacts of tariffs.\nWe're remaining agile as the situation with tariffs evolves, while also supporting the commitments we've made with our long-term suppliers. As an example of this, during the Q3, we rerouted many goods sourced from countries with large tariff exposure to our non-US markets. In the US, we pulled forward some items that we had planned for the summer and sourced additional locally produced goods to reduce tariff impacts and ensure that we were in stock.\nActions such as these are allowing us to continue to provide great values for our members while also delivering value to our shareholders. Digital and technology are important parts of our future growth, and we're investing to improve the member experience. A recent example in e-commerce is the launch of Buy Now, Pay Later offering through our partnership with Affirm.\nThis new program allows our members greater access to the Costco values on big-ticket items such as appliances, furniture, consumer electronics, and much more at exclusive rates for the Costco members. While still early days, we've been pleased with the initial sales results. In our warehouses, we continue to work on opportunities to further improve the member experience. Please be on the lookout for several new technology pilots we are focusing on to help our members check out through our front end at a faster pace.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, while the impacts of tariffs and the outlook for the economy in general remain unknown, we are confident in the ability of our operators and merchants to rise to the challenges and continue to offer great service and find consistent values for our members. Our results in recent quarters have reinforced for us that in uncertain times, our values resonate with members as strongly as ever. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the Q3 of fiscal 2025. The 12 weeks ended on 11 May 2025. We have once again published a slide deck on our investor site under events and presentations with supplemental information to support today's press release. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Net income for the Q3 came in at $1.9 billion, or $4.28 per diluted share, up more than 13% from $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per diluted share, in the Q3 last year.\nThese results were driven by strong sales and margin performance, despite the headwind of a $130 million LIFO charge in the quarter and operating income being negatively impacted by a catch-up accrual of $40 million for the increase in employee vacation days included in our March 2025 employee agreement. As in Q2, foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted the translation of international net income to US dollars. In Q3, the impact was $35 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.\nNet sales for the Q3 were $61.96 billion, an increase of 8% from $57.39 billion in the Q3 last year. US comparable sales were up 6.6%, or 7.9% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 2.9%, or 7.8% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Other international comp sales were up 3.2%, or 8.5% adjusted, and this all led to total company comp sales of 5.7%, or 8% adjusted.\nFinally, e-commerce comp sales were up 14.8%, or 15.7% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.2%, while gas price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.1%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.5% in the US. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.4% worldwide and up 1.1% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX.\nAdjusted for those items, tickets would have been up 2.7% worldwide and 2.3% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.24 billion, an increase of $117 million, or 10.4% year over year. Membership fee income growth was 11.4% excluding FX, and the recent membership fee increase represented approximately 4.6% of fee income in the quarter.\nIn terms of renewal rates at Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.7%, and the worldwide rate came in at 90.2%. As cohorts of new members from digital acquisition campaigns and warehouse openings in Asia move in and out of the calculation, there will continue to be some volatility in this number quarter to quarter. The decreases in the renewal rates in Q3 versus Q2 were primarily attributable to sign-ups from a Groupon promotion in the fall of 2023 entering the renewal rate calculation for the first time this quarter.\nHigher penetration of online sign-ups entering the renewal rate calculation also contributes to the lower renewal rate. These new digital memberships are a net positive as they grow the overall membership base and are generally younger members, but they also renew at a slightly lower rate.\nWe ended Q3 with 79.6 million paid household members, up 6.8% versus last year, and 142.8 million cardholders, up 6.6% year over year. At Q3 end, we had 37.6 million paid executive memberships, up 9% versus last year. Executive members represented 47.3% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Turning now to gross margin, our reported rate in the Q3 was higher year over year by 41 basis points, coming in at 11.25% compared to 10.84% last year, and up 29 basis points excluding gas deflation.\nCore was higher by 36 basis points and higher by 27 basis points without gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 36 basis points. A significant part of the increase was driven by our fresh departments, where strong sales leverage benefited our payroll costs and spoilage results. Additionally, the decrease in some key commodity and ingredient costs, such as dairy, butter, eggs, and olive oil, were a tailwind in fresh and food and sundries.\nIn general, we feel margin pressure during times of inflation on these types of ingredients as we keep prices low for our members, and the opposite is often true when prices fall, as we feel the margin relief faster while also being able to lower prices more quickly than our competitors. An example of this during the quarter is our croissant program, where we held prices lower when butter costs were elevated and are now seeing margin relief as those costs have come down. Food and sundries margin also increased during the quarter.\nIn this case, we were able to lower egg prices by approximately 10% and butter by $1 per sell unit, or approximately 7%, while also returning margins to more normal levels. Lastly, in core-on-core, non-food margins were up slightly worldwide but down slightly in the US. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was higher by 30 basis points and 27 basis points without gas deflation.\nImproved margins in gas and e-commerce were the main drivers of the increase. LIFO negatively impacted the gross margin rate by 23 basis points, both with and without gas deflation. We had a $130 million LIFO charge in Q3 this year compared to an $11 million credit in Q3 last year. I'll share more color on LIFO and inflation a little later in the call. Other was lower by 2 basis points, both with and without gas deflation.\nThis relates to the catch-up accrual for the increased employee vacation days included in our March 2025 employee agreement. This change impacts gross margin for the employees who work in our supply chain and/or manufacturing departments. Moving now to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the Q3 was higher or worse year over year by 20 basis points, coming in at 9.16% compared to last year's 8.96%. SG&A was higher or worse by 11 basis points adjusted for gas deflation.\nThe operations component of SG&A was higher or worse 13 basis points and 5 basis points without gas deflation. This increase was due to our investment in employee wages, partially offset by sales leverage and productivity improvements. The incremental year-over-year impact from this year's March employee agreement was mid-single-digit basis points, on top of the low double-digit basis point impact from our July 2024 wage increase.\nWe will lap the July increase 10 weeks into the 16-week fiscal Q4. SG&A was higher or worse two basis points and one basis point without gas deflation. Stock compensation was lower or better by one basis point, both with and without gas deflation. Pre-opening was higher or worse by one basis point, both with and without gas deflation, driven by more new warehouse openings in the quarter this year. Other was higher or worse by five basis points, both with and without gas deflation, reflecting the catch-up accrual for higher vacation days in our 2025 employee agreement.\nBelow the operating income line, net interest and other was $50 million this year versus $87 million last year. The difference year over year was largely attributable to foreign exchange. In terms of our income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.2% compared to 26.4% in Q3 last year. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. Capital expenditure in Q3 was approximately $1.13 billion, and we estimate CAPEX for the full year will be a little over $5 billion.\nTaking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, fresh category comparable sales were up high single digits. This was led by double-digit growth in meat, with produce also performing very well in the quarter. Non-foods also had comp sales in the high single digits. Our buyers continue to do an excellent job finding new and exciting items at great values, which are resonating well with our members even as they remain very choiceful in their spending on discretionary items. In the quarter, gold and jewelry, majors, toys, housewares, and home furnishings were all up double digits.\nWhile we continue to grow share in most non-food departments, we are seeing some deceleration in year-over-year growth as we start to lap tougher compares in bullion and gift card sales from a year ago. Food and sundries had mid to high single-digit comps, with cola and frozen food showing the strongest results.\nIn addition to lowering prices on butter and eggs, a few other examples where we were able to lower prices in the quarter to provide greater value to our members included 2-liter Kirkland Signature organic extra virgin olive oil from $24.99 to 18.39, Kirkland Signature chocolate macadamia clusters from $17.99 to 14.69, and Kirkland Signature organic mixed nut butter from $8.69 to 7.59. As Ron mentioned earlier, we are continuing to move more items to locally sourced production, which is allowing us to lower prices in those markets.\nA notable example in the quarter was our Kirkland Signature ultra-clean laundry products. These SKUs are now sourced in Asia for our APAC warehouses, allowing us to significantly lower transportation costs and reduce member prices in the region by approximately 40%. In the US, we are sourcing more American-made goods where available, including items such as mattresses, pillows, and plastic resin goods. New KS offerings are another way we are delivering more value to members.\nThese items typically offer members 15% to 20% value compared to the national brand alternative with equal or better quality. In Q3, we launched over 40 new KS items, ranging from mini muffin bites to smoked pork ribs, and various new apparel items. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy and optical departments led the way.\nWe are able to bring significant value to our members in optical through the combination of our labs, which manufacture our own high-quality lenses, coupled with great prices on a wide range of frames, including luxury brands. Gas comps were negative low double digits during the quarter, driven by a lower average price per gallon. I'll now share some additional color on inflation and tariffs.\nFresh foods and sundries inflation remained relatively similar to last quarter. In non-foods, we saw low single-digit inflation return for the first time in a number of quarters. This was driven primarily by imported items. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our sales in the US are imported, and about 2/3 of those sales are in non-foods. Items imported from China represent about 8% of total US sales.\nThe inflation experience in non-foods was the primary driver of the $130 million LIFO charge for the quarter, which is calculated comparing the net landed cost of inventory at the beginning of the fiscal year with the net landed cost of inventory on hand at the end of the current quarter. Based on our LIFO accounting methodology, if the current rate of inflation is maintained until our fiscal year end, we would have an additional $40 to $50 million LIFO charge in the Q4.\nAny change in the level of inflation in the Q4 could increase or decrease the size of that charge. As we navigate an evolving environment with tariffs, we are working closely with our suppliers to find ways to mitigate the impact on cost, including moving production and sourcing to other countries where it makes sense to do so.\nAs Ron mentioned earlier, we are leveraging our scale and global operations to help inform this approach. At Costco, we remain committed to providing quality items at the lowest possible prices, and raising prices is always seen as a last resort. The evolving landscape with tariffs is adding complexity and challenges for how we operate our business, but we believe our expertise in buying and limited SKU count model give us greater agility to navigate the environment and ultimately increase our member values compared to the market.\nThe global supply chain remains relatively stable, although, as previously shared, shipping delivery dates are generally less predictable than they were pre-COVID. While the spot rate for shipping containers has increased recently in response to a short-term increase in demand during the window that reciprocal tariffs have been paused, our shipping is generally covered by contracts, and so we have not seen any material impact. Turning now to digital and e-commerce, we continue to make progress with technology.\nAs shared on last quarter's call, one of our key focus areas is building capabilities to deliver more personal, relevant experiences for our members, helping them save time and money. In the Q3, successes included a targeted Mother's Day campaign to members who had purchased traditional Mother's Day gifts last year and the launch of a personalized product recommendation hub for members, showcasing items based on previous browsing history, new items they might find relevant, and best-selling items in their geographical area.\nGold and jewelry, toys, health and beauty, majors, housewares, small electrics, and apparel all grew double digits year over year. We continue to grow share in big and bulky items sold online, powered by our investment in Costco Logistics. The combination of great values and the delivery experience that includes installation and haul away of old items is resonating extremely well with our members and resulted in a 31% increase in items delivered in the quarter. Costco Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to show healthy year-over-year growth.\nIn Q3, fiscal year 2025, our sales on Costco Next equaled our total sales for all of fiscal year 2022, and we are excited about the pipeline of new vendors in development for future rollout. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ended Sunday, 1 June 2025, on Wednesday, 4 June 2025, after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one a second time.\nIf you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one to join the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, everyone. I wanted to ask Ron, since he's in the room. So Costco has continually invested in price, and the nice thing is that you don't really have to catch up over time. Curious what you're telling the merchants right now, given this moment in time. Do you put the pedal to the metal in anything different about the posture? Are you seeing - in places where price you're holding relative to the market, are you seeing tonnage and unit volume actually change meaningfully? Thanks.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nVery good question, Simeon. It's quite complicated, as Gary said now, as we're dealing with the moving tariff schemes as things continue to change each day. We have been very fortunate with some of the key commodities coming down, and then our buyers are immediately the first ones down on those goods. So we take every advantage of every opportunity that we can lower prices. We've seen our competitive landscape improve slightly at the latter part of the quarter, which is very good for us.\nSo it means that we're doing the right thing, but we're going to continue to invest in price. It's what we do. It's how we grow our business. And we're going to continue to try and mitigate as much of this impact on tariffs as we can for our members. So as we've always done, it's full force ahead on lowering prices where we can.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good evening, guys. So quick follow-up on that last question and then an add-on. So Ron, when you mentioned that it improved in the latter half of the latter part of the quarter, is that because your peers are raising prices? So how are price gaps changing given the inflation that's going on out there? Secondly, as you think about the March-April period, you did extremely well in the non-foods category.\nClearly, a lot of that is share. To what extent could you quantify pull forward in some of these tariffed items that you saw in the end of March, beginning of April? Thanks very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome. I think that the delta improvement has really been a very hard focus on movement and trying to work with our suppliers and lowering price wherever we can. I truly believe that we are the first one down whenever we have those opportunities, and that does create that improved delta for us.\nSo we're watching pricing daily and, if not hourly, on every key commodity. And you have commodities like butter and eggs come down. There's quite a halo effect to many different items. So our buyers are on top of that, talking to all the suppliers that would benefit from those reductions in cost and trying to really move those products into lower cost as soon as we can. So I can't speak for the others, but I can speak for us. It's about lowering the prices as soon as we can and take advantage of those opportunities.\nAs far as non-foods, yeah, we did. As we saw things starting to build on this tariff front, our buyers were very proactive, and they pulled a lot forward. A lot of our summer goods, most of our patio program, our sporting goods program, got in early this year, got it in ahead of the tariff impacts. And that allowed us to hold prices or come just slightly up on prices when we needed to be. So that has really helped. And then some key categories that we have had good, healthy inventory on, such as furniture, appliances are not so much impacted, which has been a big driver for us, and non-foods as well.\nSo it has been strategic movement of goods. And like I spoke about, things that were hit with a higher tariff, we partnered with our other regions around the world where non-US tariff impacts. And then anything in terms of how much demand maybe pulled forward? I think that there was slight. We saw slight impact on it. To quantify it, it was very tough to do. It was very tough to quantify that we saw any certain percent of a pull forward of the fear of tariffs.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Gary, it seemed like you were sending a reminder that you will soon lap this outsized growth from precious metals and gift cards. To what extent should we recalibrate our expectations as Costco laps some of those outsized gains? If you can quantify that, that would be super helpful.\nThen as part of that, at what point does Costco just reach a limitation to its rate of growth in the United States? The company's got to be mindful of depleting the overall membership experience as these clubs get so busy, and it's difficult to find parking. It's difficult to navigate through the store. It takes a little longer to get in and out. What percentage of your clubs in the United States would you say are currently at that level or approaching that level? Thank you very much.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nHi, Michael. Yeah, thanks for the questions. So just to cover the first part, I think Ron will jump in on the second part of the question. Yeah, we were sharing on the call. You may recall we'd been sharing on previous quarters that we were up double digits in non-foods, and we were high single digits this quarter. So part of the commentary that I shared was to remind you that some of that would be a reflection of the fact that we are cycling bullion starting to flow through on a year-over-year basis, particularly online. Then also gift cards. We had a particularly strong program of gift cards last year.\nSo as we cycle those, you saw still very strong non-food sales and strong market share gains, but the number would have decelerated into that high single-digit range. I think it's kind of difficult to predict, obviously, where the consumer behavior goes in the future because of some of the things that Ron mentioned around the uncertainty. And also, when you look at our individual month-to-month data, we obviously are sharing very transparently every month what our sales results are.\nThere are going to be periods where, like we shared earlier in April, where there's probably, if you look at individual item categories like consumer electronics and even in paper products, it looked like a higher level of sales in April because of that. So you probably see a little bit of relief in some of those areas flowing through in the next couple of months. But I wouldn't really say we have anything other than confidence in what our buyers are doing in finding great quality items and great value and newness in terms of new and exciting items for the member.\nEverything we're still seeing right now would be that sort of the state of the consumer is that they're very focused on those three things, but where you can meet those three things really well with value, quality, and newness, our members are still spending and buying non-foods items. So we think that the teams are doing a great job, and we continue to see opportunity to grow in that space.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOn the operations side, it is a strategic priority for all of us in the company right now is to continue to how we improve the member experience in our high-volume warehouses. As we speak about the Q4 openings, about 80% of those warehouses we're opening are going to cannibalize high-volume locations for us. That's going to take some relief off.\nSo we strategically look at new markets for openings, but with a real importance on strategically cannibalizing those warehouses where we can make that improvement of member experience in there as well. The recent expansion of gasoline hours was a great indicator that the throughput for our members improved nicely, and we saw that immediately in gallon increases.\nOn the technology front, we've realized with some of these pilots, as we are working through these different systems to speed up the front-end experience and get that moving flowing quickly, the backside of that is it turns over parking spaces quicker. And when you turn over parking spaces quicker, it makes the whole experience better.\nSo we are very mindful of the high-volume warehouses we have, and we're strategically working on many different fronts to how do we continue to grow the volume in those existing buildings and continue to infill and look for new markets in the US as we do in all the regions around the world.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI guess maybe just one thing to add to Ron's comment, Michael, as well. I think you see in our 10-K each year, we show the year-by-year sort of vintage of our warehouses. I think the ones that Ron's particularly talking about are where we have that over $400 million of sales, which is, I think, what, 40 or so warehouses where we're in that sort of category. So they're the highest priority there. I think as we do that, there's still tremendous growth in the less mature warehouses, and we see year-over-year continued growth.\nSo I think that gives us a lot of confidence that while we make those enhancements that Ron mentioned, we still have significant opportunity with the vast majority of our warehouses to continue to grow and for them to look and to mature like our higher sales warehouses today.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Appreciate the time. I think you guys have increased your EBIT margin on a year-over-year basis now by eight or nine quarters in a row, however slight, even though we've had a pretty funky macro environment, tariffs obviously being the latest piece of that. Is there any reason we would see that trend change over the next few quarters? Because it does seem like it's a bit of a conscious decision, not just randomness. Thanks.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nHi, Scot. Yeah, thanks for the question. I would say overall, I know I mentioned this last quarter as well when we talked about the gross margin rate, that we really are probably less focused than you might think on the individual quarters. We're more really focused on how we manage the business for the long term. So you are going to see, I think, individual fluctuations quarter by quarter as we make decisions to invest in the business at certain times to grow the company.\nCertainly at other times, like we saw in this quarter, of course, with gross margin rate in particular, we saw some real benefits in fresh productivity, lower spoilage, and also some of the benefits of deflation in certain commodities. I think it's fair to look at our model over the longer term. I wouldn't particularly pick a number of quarters, but I think over the longer term, looking at generally how we've been able to grow the business and grow profitability.\nI think our philosophy overall is, as I know you've heard probably my predecessor, Richard, say this many times, is that our goal is to continue finding ways to drive value for our members, lowering our prices consistently, and doing that through our global buying, doing that for in-country production, Kirkland Signature growth, as Ron mentioned earlier, and even some of the newer opportunities like e-commerce growth and getting more profitable in e-commerce and building the retail media business. In all cases, our philosophy is how do we take 90% of that value and give it back to the member to drive top line?\nAnd we do think over time we can still be increasing our margin a little bit as part of that plan. But that's our overall philosophy. So we wouldn't particularly guide to, well, we don't guide at all, as you know. We wouldn't guide to thinking about an individual quarterly cadence, but that's more philosophically how we think about growing the company.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nUnderstood. Thank you for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Gary, I wanted to follow up on your LIFO comment. Clearly, a lot of your peers use RIM inventory accounting, which is likely going to drive margins maybe in the opposite direction in the next quarter or two.\nFor your LIFO estimate about the other kind of $40 to $50 million of LIFO charge in Q4, am I reading that correctly? You're suggesting a moderation in the LIFO impact in Q4 and in the coming quarters. How should we compare that to in the 2022 period where you had more of a full 12-month impact of LIFO headwind? How does today's environment differ from then? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. I'll maybe break the question into a couple of parts because I think it's probably helpful just to explain how - I hate to get sort of too technical on the accounting side, but just at least give a brief explanation of how we follow rules in calculating our LIFO charge. So essentially, and you may recall, the first two quarters of this year, we were seeing slight deflation in non-foods.\nSo we actually had a credit to our LIFO charge for the first two quarters, largely because foods, sundries, and fresh were generally sort of fairly stable and sort of low inflation, which continues to be true, and non-foods being deflationary. In the Q3 we saw non-foods start to become slightly inflationary. So because of the way our LIFO calculation works, we're essentially estimating for the full year what the LIFO charge will be.\nSo we're saying, what will our inventory net landed cost of an item times the number of items that we have in inventory at the end of the year? How will that cost compare to the cost at the start of the year? What we do is we sort of calculate what we estimate that will be for the end of the year, and then we take the proportionate amount for the number of quarters.\nSo if you think about Q3, we saw higher inflation. As we were calculating out, our point estimate for the end of the year based on that calculation is about $145 million, call it, for the full year based on the current inflation rate that we're seeing. So we had to take three quarters or not quite three quarters, 9/13, so nine periods out of 13 periods in the year-to-date catch-up in the quarter alone. So the $130 million charge isn't a charge for the quarter. It's really a true-up for the whole of the year for our estimate of inflation.\nBecause we'll have four-thirteenths of that charge in the Q4 if inflation stays the same, that's where the $40 to $50 million incremental charge comes in the Q4. So really, all of that's getting us to the same data that we're looking at today, which is saying we believe there is inflation in our system because of the higher cost in non-foods.\nThe inflation rate has turned slightly positive on non-foods. We're estimating based on current inflation rates that we see the charge for the year will be $145 million. We've had to catch that up in the first three quarters. So it's a $130 million charge in the first three quarters that we show in Q3, and then there'll be an incremental $40 to $50 million charge in Q4. That $40 to $50 million estimate is really just based on what our current inflation rate is.\nSo if that inflation rate stays the same, if the tariff situation doesn't really change materially, that's our best estimate of what that outcome would be for the year. If we were to see higher tariffs, which led to higher cost of goods, or lower tariffs and lower cost of goods, that could move that number up or down. And we'd have to true it up for the whole year in the Q4 because it's an estimate of the inventory value at the end of the year.\nSo I'm sorry if that was a bit long-winded, but I was trying to make sure I'm giving you kind of how the math works because it could feel a bit misleading that we're saying there was $130 million of inflation during the quarter, but it's really a true-up for the first three quarters of the year. Then I would say, in general, that still means that inflation is below where it would have been back in the post-COVID period.\nOur inventory levels are anywhere between $12 to $13 billion. And so if you think of a charge of $145 million of LIFO charge, that's really only 1 to 1.5% of inflation overall within our LIFO calculation. So it's still relatively low overall inflation, but it certainly is a change in trajectory from what we were seeing in the first two quarters.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. Does that sum of that bleed into the first half of next year as well?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nIt really depends on what happens with inflation going forward. So we'd take the new level of inflation at the end of the fiscal year, and then our LIFO forecast for 2026 would be based on whether we think the amount of inventory and the net landing cost of the product will increase in that year. So it really depends on there wouldn't be a carryover from current inflation into 2026, but if inflation was to rise again, that could create a higher LIFO charge in 2026 or a lower LIFO charge if tariffs were reduced.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nRight. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSo just to clarify, the LIFO charge, the $12 to 13 billion is for US inventory because we're still on the retail method for most of our international countries. So it's really based on our US business that the LIFO charges incur.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nRight. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. Just one quick clarification and then follow-up on digital. On the inflation in grocery last quarter, you said it was slightly positive. Was that around 0.1%? Is that the sort of range we're talking about?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYes, it would be in that range, maybe just slightly higher than that, Greg, but you're in the right ballpark. Low single digits for sure. Again, very similar to last quarter. In grocery, it's a bit like it's been for the year to date. There are some items that are inflationary within grocery. So while egg prices have come down, as we mentioned earlier, within the year, they're still inflationary compared to what we would have seen in eggs last year. Things like pulp are still inflationary as well within grocery.\nBut then you've got butter, flour, cheese, and some of the dairy items that have turned deflationary. So there's quite a bit of moving parts in there, but it really hasn't changed that materially since the earlier part of the year overall.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nWhat I'd love to do is a little deeper on digital, just given the double mid-teens growth. Could you just level set us now on what percentage of the business is digital? And particularly that Costco Logistics, up 31%, what percentage of e-commerce is now done through Costco Logistics?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. On the first part of the question, it depends on the definition you use. So if you just do the sort of math on our business and how we define digital, which, as a reminder, doesn't include the delivery solutions that we offer through Instacart.\nIt doesn't include our Travel business where most of it would be online. So there's a number of elements that I think others might include in their sort of e-commerce business that we wouldn't. So on the straight math on how we define it, it would be about 8% of our business. If we included some of the components that others would include, it probably takes it to slightly north of 10%.\nThen if you take gas out of our total sales, which I know obviously there isn't an e-commerce element to gas, it's around the 12% of total sales that we generate today, Greg. Then in terms of - yeah.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\n[crosstalk] Costco Logistics - this is Ron. It's about 20% to 25% of our total deliveries for Costco Logistics, but it is about 80% to 85% of our big and bulky. We don't run. Our buyers make decisions of what to put through that network and what not to put through it.\nAnd so they look for the best cost delivery source. And so we know that big and bulky, patio, furniture, televisions, safes, those kind of things, all but the super specialty stuff, we run through Costco Logistics. So a big chunk of that business is going through the network of big and bulky.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nIs there any members that haven't used your digital yet in some way, shape, or form, or is it still only half the people that really use it?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. It's over half that have downloaded the app for sure, but there's still plenty of opportunity for growth in our mind. We still see it as an area where we'd expect to outpace our overall growth. As we continue to improve the member experience with enhancements every quarter, Greg, around whether it's the inventory available on the app or improving the search functionality, improving the way in which we communicate with members, as I talked about earlier on the call, we believe all of those things are going to drive more digital engagement.\nWe think, tied to even some of the comments that Ron was making about speed of checkout, where members use the digital wallet and have their payment card integrated within the wallet, it significantly increases the speed of checkout through the check lane in the warehouse as well. So we still think there's plenty of opportunity to keep driving higher penetration of digital engagement with our members. And we think it's got a runway to continue to grow in the future.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat quarter. Thanks for the details.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nEquity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. Ron, you called out some technology efforts at the front end as an opportunity. Could we double-click on that a little bit? Then with regards to the extended hours of operation at the gas stations themselves, have you thought about testing that within the clubs? Thanks.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. The first question, yeah, as Gary said, we found that digital really enhances the speed of checkout. And so we are really working hard on the digital membership card usage as well. We've also engaged in some scan-and-go done by Costco kind of tests that we're doing out there that have been extremely successful of moving people through the lines and expediting the transactions.\nWe've seen some very, very early results have been very positive, and great adoption from our members seeing that as well. So we're just looking at the whole overall. Our operations team is really focused on the front ends, and we know there's many benefits to that part of the Costco experience of moving people through much better.\nSo it really is using the digital enhancements that we have available today, and we think we'll see some good things going through there. Yeah, we continue to look at the hours of the operation as well. Gas has been very creative to scale in growth in our sales in the Gas business. So we continue to look at the operation side of things as well, the warehouse hours.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nEquity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Hey.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nQuick one for Gary, one for Ron. I know you got a depot opening in Florida soon. Can you remind us on the supply chain side, distribution, transportation? What's the opportunity there to continue to lower cost from where we are now? And then, Ron, have you made any changes with regard to tariffs on how you think about receipts, demand planning over the next, I don't know, six months, and how you flow that in? It's harder maybe for you to chase inventory, but how do you attack that, if at all?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, John. On the depots, I think that it's certainly interesting being relatively new to the company to see really how efficiently we operate our depot network, as I think you may be familiar with. We generally are not really holding inventory in any of the depots. We're moving product straight through. So I think it ties a little bit to your point of, as we grow in scale, how do we make sure we optimize the network to be even more efficient just because of the scale of operations that we have now?\nAnd we know that when we look at our most productive warehouses and highest volume areas, we see incremental leverage that's created in our overall financial model. So I don't think there'd be anything we'd call out as being a change in strategy, but certainly continuing to invest capital in places where it makes sense to optimize the network for depots, we think can help continue to improve our efficiency. Then I think the second part of it would probably be more in e-commerce.\nAs we're growing that business, we have built out the Costco Logistics network and invested in, especially on the west side of the country, I would say. When we acquired Innovel, there was a strong presence in the east, less presence in the west and so we built out that network.\nI think it's part of how we keep showing improvement quarter over quarter in the other gross margin line where e-commerce continues to improve. Part of that is really leveraging those investments to drive more scale and more efficiency in our e-commerce operations. That's probably the bigger area where you see it in our results quarter to quarter.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThe question on strategic planning of future buying, yes, our buyers are extensively going through short-term, mid-term, and long-term strategies as far as buying goes. As you know, the continuous changing environment out there has presented a lot of opportunities for that group to stay on top of this. We're having to make some decisions based on the current information that we know today.\nAs you can imagine, with our volume and the size of our company, our commitments are six, eight months out for supply with a lot of our suppliers. In doing that, we're empowering our buyers to make decisions now based on the importance of the item. Is it something that we can replace with something domestically here, or is it something that we need to go ahead and move on quickly and bring in prior to any future tariff increases? They have a strategic plan out there. They're looking at different areas.\nWe went through a lot of this exercise during the COVID days when you couldn't get goods out of China for a different reason. That's the shipping backups that we had there. And I think our buying and I know our buying team executed great results during those periods of being very nimble and going out and finding new places that bring value and quality to our members. So we're going to remain nimble.\nWe're going to make good decisions and the nice part is we do have some non-US business that we can work closely with. If we do get caught with something at a higher tariff rate that we don't feel would be something good for our members here in the US, we can work with the other regions to move goods out there as well.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer",
    "content2": "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So two quick ones for me. So just going back to the core and core margin improvement, Gary, do you expect some of the positive drivers you saw during the quarter to continue near term? Then second, just on tariffs, just given maybe there's some hopes out there that some of these tariffs will be rolled back. If we do see that, would you expect your vendors to reduce some of the tariff-induced price increases?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Rupesh. On the core gross margin, I would say some of those were fairly unique to the quarter in the sense that the adjustment that we saw around some of the deflation in some of the ingredients that I talked around, around butter, eggs, and dairy.\nAnd I think, as you know, we continue to look for ways to invest in the member to drive top-line growth in our sales. So I think, again, versus sort of maybe talking about what might happen in the next few quarters, I think of it really sort of reflecting what I shared earlier in the call, where how can we continue to invest those dollars to drive more value for the member, drive top-line growth in the company?\nI do think that we've been able to be somewhat nimble in that if there are continued impacts on inflation in non-foods, obviously we could see some impact there that where we're giving back to the member essentially to try and hold on some of the increases there and the benefit that we've had on things like fresh in particular, where you look at the productivity improvements and spoilage improvements.\nObviously, those are the things that can potentially fund our investments in other areas to ensure that we're delivering more value for the member. So I think we'd look at it more on the longer term versus the short-term benefits, but we'll continue to look for ways to invest to drive top-line growth in the business. Then I think from a tariff rollback, it's kind of really difficult to predict.\nObviously, we're operating in really a dynamic environment, and we're staying agile. I think all of our suppliers are staying agile. And really, the focus is on how do we react to the moment and make sure that we're there for our members in managing prices of the products and continuing to find the most relevant items for the member. So it's a little bit difficult to predict what might happen around the corner.\nBut I think, as Ron mentioned earlier, we believe we're, because of our limited SKU counts and the expertise of our buyers and that long-term commitment to our suppliers that we have, we believe there's opportunity for us to continue to widen our value versus the market as we adapt to the changing environment.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to try and see if we could understand your stance on inventory planning here. You made the comment that raising prices is a last resort, which is clearly consistent with Costco's pricing philosophy.\nBut as we look out into the back half of this year, can you give us a sense of how much price that might not be able to mitigate that might end up having to be passed on and how that could impact your units, particularly on the discretionary side of the business, how you might be planning those? Then I guess also with respect to inventory, are you seeing an environment that is supporting an elevated level of opportunistic buys in this dynamic environment?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Kelly. I think, as I mentioned a moment ago, it's just such a dynamic environment right now that really the focus that we've had in our buying teams is really staying agile to manage the situation. I think I mentioned in the prepared comments, a lot of the focus the team has right now is, as we look at the impact of tariffs, where are the places we can work with our suppliers to find ways to be offsetting some of the impact of those?\nWhere are places where we could potentially be sourcing with them from different countries, if that's practical, to minimize the impact? And in some cases, we're also looking at, I think, a benefit of being a limited SKU count model is we can look at rotating into different items and finding different assortment that makes more sense for the member.\nSo, I think to answer your question, it's probably difficult to say in general terms because it really depends on the individual items and looking at how do we make sure we're delivering the best value for the member and delivering the right items that will really resonate with them and drive the volume that we allow us to keep those prices very low and really kind of doing it item by item. I'll give you a couple of examples that might be helpful. As we looked at what happened with fresh, for example, during the last quarter, we saw inflation as a result of tariffs because we import certain fresh items from Central and South America.\nSo on pineapples and bananas, for example, because they're key staple items for the member, and we felt it was important to really eliminate the impact there for the member by working with our suppliers and by us finding efficiencies and accepting that there may be a margin impact, we essentially held the price on those to make sure that we're protecting the member.\nWhen we looked at - we also sourced flowers from Central and South America. We looked at that item and decided that while we were able to offset some of the tariffs through similar activity, that we did increase some price there because we felt that that was something that the member would be able to absorb and it was more of a discretionary item there.\nIf I look at the non-food examples, we're starting to look now, because of the potential impact of tariffs, [at] where there are places where there are items that are produced in the US where we might have opportunities to lean in more to some of those items and deliver great value? It might be live goods, mattresses, and pillows I mentioned, I think, in the prepared comments on the call, even US outdoor furniture, some of these areas where we think there could be opportunities to really deliver value for the member when there are maybe some places where that value might not be there because of the impact of tariffs.\nHealth and beauty would be another good example, I think, including nutritional items that have grown really strongly for us, and we see strong continued appetite for those items from members. So looking to really see where there are opportunities to buy great items at great quality and value for our members there as well.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you. I was curious if I could just follow up with a question on the Affirm partnership and the thought process there. Clearly, Costco has maybe a more defined set of payment options for members than typical retailers. So just curious if you tested this and what you expect to get out of this. Is it just more support for kind of the big and bulky purchases? Just any thoughts there?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. It's very much as you described, Kelly. We saw that, actually, we saw partly because Affirm has a white label product, if you like, where it's offering service to members, that there were some Costco members that were already using Affirm as a solution for part of purchasing certain products at Costco while not coming through our ecosystem and not getting the full value from Costco with the exclusive pricing that we can offer to members on the Affirm product when it's through our website and through our digital solutions.\nAs we looked at the growth that we're seeing, which has been very strong in many of those big and bulky and large purchase items, we recognize there are some members that want to be able to structure those payments over a period of time. And we believe it's an opportunity for us to be able to deliver more value for the member by having exclusive pricing there while also giving them more options in the way in which they can buy the product.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. The numbers really do speak for themselves when it comes to membership growth. But we wondered if there was anything to note, just given that it's been several months since the price increase, in terms of any kind of member response. Internationally, have you seen any kind of impact from Costco being a US brand?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Kate. Overall, on membership, I'd say we're very pleased with the metrics. We tend to look at it across renewal rates, continued sign-up activity overall, and then, is the membership count and the income growing. When we look at those three metrics, we're pleased with the overall direction that we're seeing in all of those metrics. It's a little bit early in the renewal calculation still to have a really good feel for any impact from the membership fee increase.\nWe'd just be starting to see some of that into the number now, but nothing that we'd flag as material in the numbers that we're seeing in renewal rate. I think, as we shared before, we really haven't heard a lot of member feedback. I think the fact we waited seven years to increase the fee when we typically would do it in five, and so there was a level of understanding it may be coming, and then also holding on many prices around the hot dog and the rotisserie chicken at times when inflation was higher as well. So, nothing in general I would call out there.\nOverall, then, in terms of the international business, to your question, I would say that our members are very vocal in sharing feedback. I think we certainly hear some feedback from members that they wish the relationship was better today between the countries.\nBut in terms of sales growth, as you saw in our published numbers, we continue to have really strong sales growth in Canada and internationally. In fact, I was just looking this morning; all of our international countries had positive comp growth during the quarter as well. So there's really nothing that we call out other than I think there's definitely a recognition that there's tension at the moment between the relationships.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nOh, hey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. I guess a question on the renewal rates. I know you flagged that they would be coming in a little bit because of the nature of the past sign-up. How long do you think this persists? When do you think it may stabilize? Then any theories as to why these digital members renew at a lower rate? Do you have any strategies to address that? Is it just the nature of the member or the new customers that are signing up? Just curious your thoughts on that. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Peter. I'd say overall, we expect it's likely to continue for a while. You may recall last quarter, it bumped up by 20 basis points. This quarter, it bumped down by 30 basis points. And so you kind of have this lag of periods of time where we've got these digital promotions that we're doing that are coming into the calculation. And there are some members that are taking advantage of a unique promotion there.\nThere are also a average younger age of member in that group as well. So we tend to see they renew at a slightly lower rate overall within digital. So I think this is something that we'd expect to see for a period of time to come because of those factors. Then you add to that that there wasn't really any impact from this in this quarter, but we do have Asian warehouses that open that have a large number of members per warehouse. It can be four to five times the average that we see in the US per warehouse.\nSome of that is really in the first year, just traveling long distances to come and see the warehouse for the first time. And then we do see a lower renewal rate on those warehouses, and the denominator is big. So it does have an impact there as well. So I do think you should expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.\nI think, to the second part of your question, that we do see it as an opportunity, especially with the digital members that, as we see more members start to sign up digitally, getting them into the warehouse, engaging with them more through more relevant and personalized communication, there's an opportunity to move those members up the loyalty curve and renewal rates more significantly.\nPart of that, in truth, is also just their maturity in general. When we look at our younger members, they generally renew at a slightly lower rate. So it's not a surprise to us that that's the case, but we think there's an opportunity for us to improve that renewal rate by continuing to engage with them more effectively digitally and making sure we bring them into the warehouse.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nThat's helpful color. Thanks, Gary. Good luck.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session and today's call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

Before we dive into our financial results for the quarter, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is joining us for today's call. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we wrap up the Q1 of fiscal 2025, let me make a few brief comments on some of the highlights since we last spoke in September. In the Q1 of fiscal 2025, we opened seven new warehouses. This included one relocation and resulted in six net new buildings, of which four were outside of the US. Additionally, after the end of the quarter, on the day before Thanksgiving, we opened our 897th warehouse in Pleasanton, California. That opening had the highest ever opening day sales for a US warehouse at $2.9 million that day.\nWe continue to project 29 openings during fiscal year 2025, of which three will be relocations, and so 26 net new buildings. 10 of those warehouses will be outside of the US.\nGary will speak to a more detailed review of our results in a few moments, but I wanted to share some fun facts regarding our growth across the business. Our US bakery division has reached new records of 4.2 million pies being sold the three days prior to Thanksgiving. In our US food courts, on Halloween Day, we set a new record of 274,000 whole pizzas being sold. That was an increase of 21%. Our US pharmacy business has prescription growth exceeding 19% for Q1, setting new volume records for that business. And lastly, we continue to gain market share with our e-commerce big and bulky fulfilled by Costco Logistics.\nCostco Logistics completed nearly 1 million deliveries in Q1 and over 196,000 deliveries last week alone. That was a new record as well. The majority of these deliveries were completed in four days from the members ordering their merchandise online. All of these milestones reflect the continued strength of our business across the membership offering. These great results are a reflection of the outstanding work done by our over 330,000 employees around the world. Their commitment to our company and the Costco experience for our members is truly inspiring. I'd like to thank all of our people for their outstanding work this year and especially during our busiest time of the year.\nAs we approach our annual shareholders meeting in January, I also wanted to mention that our annual update to the Costco sustainability commitments was just made available online today. This report provides a comprehensive review of the progress we're making towards our sustainability objectives, and I would encourage all of you to take a look. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results of the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the Q1 of fiscal 2025, the 12 weeks ending 24 November. We have once again published a slide deck on our investor site under events and presentations with supplemental information to support today's press release. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Net income for the Q1 came in at $1.798 billion, or $4.04 per diluted share, up from $1.589 billion, or $3.58 per diluted share, in the Q1 last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $100 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to stock-based compensation.\nLast year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, also related to stock-based compensation. Excluding these discrete tax items, net income and earnings per diluted share grew 9.9% and 9.8%, respectively. Net sales for Q1 was $60.99 billion, an increase of 7.5% from $56.72 billion in Q1 last year. US comparable sales were up 5.2%, or 7.2% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 5.8%, or 6.7% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Other international comp sales were up 4.7%, or 7.1% adjusted. This all led to total company comp sales of 5.2%, or 7.1% adjusted for gas deflation and FX.\nFinally, e-commerce comp sales were up 13%, or 13.2% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.3%, while gas price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.6%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.1% worldwide, and 4.9% in the US.\nOur average transaction or ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, ticket would have been up 2% worldwide and up 2.3% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.166 billion, an increase of $84 million, or 7.8% year-over-year. Membership fee income growth was also 7.8% excluding FX. Remember that the recent membership fee increase doesn't have much impact yet due to the effects of deferred accounting, and represented less than 1% of the fee growth in the quarter.\nIn terms of renewal rates, at Q1 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.8%, down one-tenth of a percent from Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down one-tenth of a percent, primarily due to the US and Canada.\nAs we mentioned on the last quarterly earnings call, our renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than our base as a whole. Underlying renewal rates and membership growth remain strong, but this mixed shift is likely to have a continued effect on our published renewal rate for the remainder of 2025. We ended Q1 with 77.4 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year, and 138.8 million cardholders, up 7.2% year-over-year. At Q1 end, we had 36.4 million paid Executive Memberships, up 9.2% versus last year. Executive Members now represent 46.8% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales.\nTurning to gross margin, our reported rate in the Q1 was higher year-over-year by 24 basis points, coming in at 11.28% compared to 11.04% last year, and up seven basis points excluding gas deflation. Core margin was higher by 31 basis points and higher by 17 basis points without gas deflation. This was driven by mix and our credit card co-brand program. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by three basis points. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was lower by 12 basis points and lower by 16 basis points ex gas deflation.\nThis decrease year-over-year was largely due to gas partially offset by e-commerce. 2% reward was lower or better by five basis points or six basis points without gas deflation. LIFO was flat for the quarter. We had a $19 million LIFO credit in Q1 this year compared to a $15 million credit in Q1 last year. Moving on to SG&A, our reported SG&A rate in the Q1 was higher year-over-year by 14 basis points, coming in at 9.59% compared to last year's 9.45%. SG&A was flat adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher or worse by 15 basis points and higher four basis points excluding gas deflation.\nHigher employee wages that went into effect in July drove the headwind for the quarter, partially offset by sales leverage and productivity gains. As always, investing in our employees remains a key part of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on driving top-line sales and improving productivity to mitigate the incremental costs. Central was higher or worse by five basis points and three basis points without gas deflation. Stock compensation was lower or better by two basis points and three basis points without gas deflation. Pre-opening costs were lower or better by four basis points, both with and without gas deflation.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $37 million versus $38 million last year. Interest income was $96 million versus $154 million last year. As mentioned in our Q4 earnings, interest income faced headwinds in the quarter due to lower cash balances subsequent to our special dividend in January 2024 and lower interest rates. This will continue to negatively impact year-over-year compared in Q2. FX and other was a $51 million gain in Q1 this year versus a $6 million gain last year. This gain offset much of the headwind we saw in interest income in the quarter and was primarily due to FX.\nIn terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 22% compared to 24.5% in Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited from a $100 million discrete item related to our annual RSU vesting. Adjusted for this benefit, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.5%. Turning now to some key items of note for the quarter. Ron talked earlier about our continued momentum with new warehouse openings, and capital expenditure in Q1 was approximately $1.26 billion. We estimate CapEx for the full year will be approximately $5 billion. Taking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, fresh led the way in Q1 with comparable sales up high single digits.\nMeat was up double digits and demonstrated strength across the department. We have members who are continuing to purchase high-ticket premium cut selections and others who are gravitating more towards lower cost per pound options. As always, our focus remains on delivering exceptional quality and value across every item we sell in fresh. Our non-foods category was also up high single digits, despite some impact from the calendar shift, as our buyers continue to bring in new and exciting items at great values. Gold jewelry, gift cards, home furnishings, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, luggage, kiosks, and hardware were all up double digits.\nThis quarter, we were able to add several new high-quality brands across a broad range of categories, including Peloton, Wrangler, Springfree Trampolines, and Ruggable. Food and sundries had mid-single digit comps, with our cooler and frozen food departments leading the way.\nWe continue to see strong momentum with new and exciting international food items, such as Synear Pork Soup Dumplings, Sona Masoori Rice, and Hot Pot Beef Sliced Chuck Rolls. Kirkland Signature continues to grow at a faster pace than our business as a whole. Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices where we see the opportunities to do so. And just a few examples this quarter include Kirkland Signature Organic Peanut Butter reduced from $11.49 to $9.99, Kirkland Signature Chicken Stock from $9.99 to $8.99, and Kirkland Signature Sauvignon Blanc from $7.49 to $6.99.\nOur merchants are also driving innovation with Kirkland Signature. Most notably this quarter, we introduced new Kirkland Signature Oxi Powder and Kirkland Signature Food Storage Bags, both offering significant value to the national brand alternatives. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy had the strongest sales growth.\nOur focus continues to be on keeping prescription and OTC prices low, while also leveraging technology to make it easier for our members to use our pharmacy. Recent examples include the introduction of new prescription inventory management software to better stay in stock and enabling delivery of prescriptions via Instacart. Our food court and optical departments also performed well in the quarter. Gas sales were negative low double digits due to the average price per gallon being down low double digits. Costco Travel is another way we deliver unique membership value, and these services continue to resonate well with our members.\nWe offer a wide range of vacation packages, car rentals, cruises, hotels, flights, and other travel-related services. In addition to highly attractive rates, many of our offerings include a Costco Shop Card as extra value for booking with Costco. A couple of fun facts about our travel business. Last year, we sold enough rental cars to fill every US Costco parking spot 8.5 times. We also offer great value to members on cruises, and our largest cruise booking last year was a 150-day around-the-world cruise starting from Fort Lauderdale and making stops in places like the Galápagos Islands and Easter Island.\nThe total price was $293,000 for two in the Owner's Suite cabin, and added values on the booking included a shipboard credit of $13,000 and a Costco Shop Card worth $25,000. Members who use Costco Travel spend approximately twice as much as members that do not use these services. Inflation was once again essentially flat in the quarter across all core merchandise. Food and sundries, and fresh foods were slightly inflationary, and this was offset by deflation in non-foods.\nIn the supply chain, while egg suppliers have been negatively impacted by avian influenza and the recent East Coast port strikes led to a spike in paper and water product demand, overall product supply has generally been good. The predictability of on-time shipping delivery remains below pre-COVID levels, and items are generally spending more time on the water. Our merchants have adapted well to this change, and we are in a great position with inventory for the holidays. As we head into Q2, we continue to monitor for potential port strikes in India, the East Coast, and Canada, and our merchants are adapting plans as necessary to ensure we remain in stock for our members.\nTurning to digital and e-commerce, we continue to make progress with our technology roadmap, and enhancements made to the member experience, like the ability to check warehouse inventory via the Costco app, are resonating well.\nOur US app was downloaded 2.9 million times in the quarter, bringing total downloads to approximately 42 million. E-commerce traffic, conversion rates, and average order value were all up year-over-year, helping to drive another strong quarter of comparable sales growth. While strength in bullion was a meaningful tailwind to e-commerce sales, hardware, sporting goods, gift cards, and home furnishings all grew double digits year-over-year.\nAs Ron mentioned earlier, Costco Logistics also had another great quarter driving growth in big and bulky items, and Costco Next, our curated marketplace, achieved record sales over the Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales period. In closing, let me provide a brief update on retail media. To use a baseball analogy, we are very much in the early innings with retail media, but we continue to believe this represents a significant growth opportunity in the future.\nThis quarter, we completed our first targeted media campaign through third-party media channels with one of our largest CPG partners. The campaign achieved two to three times the return on ad spend typically expected, highlighting the value we can create for our members and suppliers. Our retail media team is now working with over 25 suppliers who are eager to participate in our next wave of offsite campaigns. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 5 January, on Wednesday, 8 January, after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the lineup for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many of your questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.\nAgain, it is star one if you would like to join the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi everyone. I hope you can hear me. My one question with a couple parts. Actually, diagnosing the health of the consumer, can you give us some sense of how you're clearing some of the seasonal inventory, maybe apparel, bigger tickets? And then once in a while, we talk about market share in some discretionary categories. Can you share your perspective on that? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Simeon. Yeah, we can hear you well, and thanks for the question. Yeah, so maybe taking that question in a few parts. As we look at the consumer, I think we're seeing a lot of similar trends that we've talked about on the last few quarters. What we're seeing with our members is that now, probably more than any time in recent history, that combination of newness of items, quality, and value are really important to the member. And we're seeing the member being very choiceful about how they're spending the dollars.\nAll that being said, I think we're finding that as our merchants are doing a great job of finding that newness and quality at great value, we've seen some great strength in our non-food categories. And certainly, as you heard me say on the prepared comments, we're seeing really strong performance across many of the categories around things like gold and jewelry, gift cards, home furnishings, sporting goods, health and beauty, hardware, all up double digits during the quarter.\nSo we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing there, and I think it reflects the fact that our members are willing to spend as inflation comes down, as long as those sort of three key ingredients that I mentioned are there for the member as well.\nI think in terms of overall what we're seeing with the member on food and grocery, I would say that we are seeing what we think is a little bit of a shift from food away from home to food at home, and that's certainly reflected in strong meat and produce sales that we've seen in our own business. We are seeing, I think, a little bit even more of a trend that we've talked about in prior quarters of bifurcation with the member, where we have high-quality premium cuts there selling well, but we're also seeing a gravitation towards those lower price per pound items across categories like poultry, cuts of beef, and pork as well. Ron, anything you'd like to add?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, I guess, Simeon, the other part of your question, seasonal sell-through appears to be very strong. It's a unique retail calendar with a shorter period of time after Thanksgiving, but our buyers have been through this before, and they've responded properly with that as well. So that feels good. Seems to be a very foundational Christmas, though, as you see furniture driving a lot of our e-commerce sales, appliances, sporting goods, and hardware. And so just people are very basic buying this year, but good trends.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, and I think, Simeon, I guess I didn't mention specifically, we tend to focus on our member and how can we deliver that great value. The data that we do see would tend to suggest that we're growing our share across most of the categories that I mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, Ron and Gary. Happy holidays. Your traffic continues to impress a lot. As we look forward, what are your thoughts and key drivers and mix opportunities as you think about ticket and UPT? Also, you highlighted retail media, which is a huge, great opportunity. How does that intersect with your important Multi-Vendor Mailer? And also, as you think about incrementality of that opportunity, that would be great to hear. Thank you very much.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Oliver. I think the first part of your question, you probably heard in some of the comments that we made that we have been pleased with the traffic that we've seen and the continued frequency of shop from our members. What was nice to see at the end of last quarter, we did see when you adjust for foreign exchange and gasoline that we started to turn positive on the items per basket.\nAnd then this quarter, when you adjust for those items, we were up about 2%, slightly over 2%, I think, on the US and 2% worldwide. So we have seen some improved momentum on the items per basket, and I think that's a lot of great work being done by, again, our merchants making sure that we've got great product offerings in the warehouse, and then our operators really executing those campaigns exceptionally well when the members are in the warehouse as well. From a media perspective, I think we look at it very much as an incremental opportunity. Our goal is to continue to maximize the value we can put into everyday product quality and pricing.\nWhere we're seeing a lot of the interest in retail media is really coming from the marketing agencies, which gives us a lot of confidence that this is an opportunity for us to tap into new marketing dollars where a lot of our national brand suppliers are going to those media agencies to invest those marketing dollars to really make sure they're getting a good return on that ad spend. So where we're seeing a lot of attraction, and again, I would emphasize it's very early days with retail media for us, it's something that we're just really embarking on that offsite journey.\nBut really, where most of the interest is coming from is from retail media agencies, which we believe is the way for us to make sure that we're driving incrementality and growth in the model.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good evening, guys. So can you talk about what drove the core-on-core margin performance this quarter? You have the MFI now rolling through. How do you think about reinvestment of price, either in terms of expected price reductions that you see coming down the supply chain or maybe even going above and beyond that? And just as a side question, can you define what's in the hardware category? Is that consumer electronics? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Thank you for the question. Yeah, in terms of the core-on-core margin, first of all, which I think was the first part of your question, if you break it down between the sort of three main categories that we see within the business, that's foods, fresh, and non-foods. Foods would have been essentially flat. Non-foods would have been down slightly, and fresh would have been up slightly. So those three kind of, obviously, overall, we were just up three basis points. So there really wasn't a tremendous amount of change overall, but they would have been the sort of key puts and takes in the overall number.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd then the description of the hardware category really is just that. It's storage, plumbing, lighting, power tools, batteries, those type of the household goods that you would find at a typical hardware store.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAnd then on the price investment side, your thought process there?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThat's something that we've done for the history of the company. We're going to continue to invest in price, and some of it may come in holding certain prices as some commodities are starting to increase. But investing in items like Gary described, leading with Kirkland Signature.\nI mean, we feel if we're going to be asking our members and our vendors to contribute with lower prices, we've got to set that example and start with Kirkland. So we're going to continue to look at those opportunities and invest where we can and keep driving sales.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Have a great holiday season.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you. You as well.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you for taking my question. I have a two-part question. One, I think, Gary, you mentioned the difference in renewal rates from online sign-ups and then offline sign-ups. Can you help us break it out and understand the difference in online behaviors? And second part, on the retail media side, how do you expect Costco Next, the third-party marketplace, to contribute to the growth of retail media going forward? And will that impact the membership loyalty in any way or regard? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So first of all, on the membership rate, I'd maybe take a step back and just say overall, we're feeling very good about the underlying membership metrics that we're seeing. So renewal rates in general, sign-up activity, and then the membership growth remains very strong. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, really what we're seeing is that over the last few years, we've seen some shift in more of the members that we're acquiring coming through digital channels. And that's helping with the comment that we made last quarter where we're also seeing a slight reduction in the average age of members because of that change in shift as well.\nBut what it does mean is that often when we have new members being recruited through that digital channel, they're renewing at a slightly lower rate than the historical base that we have. And you may recall that when we talk about membership renewal rates, it's effectively an 18-month lag that we report out on that renewal rate. And so as we look forward and see that trend continuing as we build more of that new digital member into the base and it slightly affects the mix, we expect it will have a slight impact on that overall membership renewal rate that we report. So we wanted to make sure we gave you visibility into that.\nWhen we look at individual sort of cohorts of members, we feel good about the ability for us to be able to continue to drive improvement in renewal rate, but we are going to see that impact through as it becomes a flow-through from the continued growth in digital members.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd then this is Ron, the question on Costco Next. Costco Next is our marketplace. This is an exclusive Costco member-only marketplace. It's fully curated by our buyers. So everything that's on that site has been reviewed by our buyers, but is exclusive to Costco members. So we think it's just going to enhance the relationship we have with our members and give more options for their shopping needs.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGot it. Just to clarify, I was wondering if you were going to have more 3P marketplace vendors using the retail media service and whether there's any implications on the member side.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd that, again, as Gary mentioned earlier, we're in the very early stages and we're going to look at where we feel the benefits will be to our members. So that is to be determined yet.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nHey, thanks very much. I know this is maybe a little out of left field, but just curious, there's kind of been a trend in retail for stock splits generally. And I'm wondering what your philosophy is on that because I know you want your employees to have an opportunity to buy stock below the store manager level. And the second question that's kind of unrelated is just tariffs. Any thoughts on that and thoughts on what that could do to inflation?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Karen. Yeah, on the stock split, you're probably aware that Costco has done stock splits in the past. And it's something that we'll continue to evaluate and discuss with our board, but there isn't a plan at this time for a stock split. I think for us, the way we think about it is the economic arguments that were true in the past are a little bit less clear because retail investors and employees both have the ability now to buy fractional shares. But we do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investors and employees who are very important constituents for us. So we'll continue to evaluate over time.\nThen I think the second part of the question was on tariffs?\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nYeah.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, I think from a tariff point of view, what I would say is that, first of all, there's a lot of uncertainty around the timing and scope of changes. It makes it difficult for anyone to predict what the impact will be with confidence. In general, of course, tariffs raise costs. That's not something that we see as a positive in general. With that being said, I'll quote my predecessor, Richard. He'd say, \"When it rains, it rains on everybody.\" I think for us, we've faced tariffs in the past, and we believe that our merchants and buyers are equipped, as anybody is, to sort of work through and navigate and manage that situation.\nWe have a plan over time where we have done that in the past, and typically we'll look where we can to pull forward inventory buying, which actually we've done already because of some of the less predictability around shipping and how much time product spends on the water, and also because of the risk of strikes that we've seen in the past as well. We'll, of course, try and work with our vendors to make sure we're looking for ways where we can to mitigate the cost. We also consider alternative sourcing locations where that's practical as well.\nI guess the final sort of string in our bow would be if we didn't see the value in an individual SKU, then we could always pivot to a different SKU item for the member if we felt the value just wasn't there and it was more effective for us to move to a different item in the warehouse. I guess in context for us, the sort of amount of business that's affected, about a quarter of our business is non-foods, and then a subset of that is imported. So remember, it's a minority of our overall business, and then it's a smaller part of that as well, we actually import, just for context.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Melius Research\n\nGreat. And thank you very much. Have a great holiday.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou too. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you about CapEx. CapEx has kind of been inching up over the last couple of years. But taking a step back and thinking about the evolution of your business, your goals, growing the moat, how are you thinking about the outlook for CapEx? Any meaningful changes ahead? And as part of this, anything different sort of in the pipeline from a project or priority standpoint?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Ed. I wouldn't say there's really any major changes. You mentioned we have been gradually increasing capital expenditure, more reflection of the continued growth of the business as we've opened new warehouses, seen some inflation in those costs over the last few years. And we have, of course, been investing a little bit more in technology as well as we sort of modernize the platforms there and look to build the right capabilities to support growth in the future.\nBut I think philosophically, we focus on job number one, of course, is to focus on the warehouses and invest in continuing to maintain the quality of our fleet and invest in new growth warehouses in that 25 to 30 range, updating our supply chain and depots to support the capabilities there and both digitally. And then also, as I mentioned, sort of technology investments. But I wouldn't indicate at this point that there's any major change in trajectory. It's more just continuation of the growth strategy that we've had and executing on that strategy.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nHey, guys. Two quick things. Philosophically, price investments get a lot of publicity. But when you think about reinvesting the MFI increase, price, product quality, right, IT, labor, there's a lot of things to invest in. Where do those other things rank relative to price? And then what does the international club pipeline look like? I'm thinking in particular where you control sites, even though they may be years away. Is that? I don't think it's over 100, but how big is that pipeline today?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, John. I'll jump in first, and Ron may want to add some color as well. I think overall, we look at the reinvestment of the membership fee holistically. So it's partly where is it that we can lower prices, of course. Part of it's where can we mitigate the impact of inflation to maintain the value for the member, even if costs are increasing. It's how can we improve the membership experience, including investing in our employees' wages as we've done recently as well. And of course, innovation with new products through Kirkland Signature.\nSo I think we tend to look at it holistically and say, How do we make sure that when we think about what our members are paying for the membership fee each year, that we're delivering more value and showing them that they're getting greater value than they're paying by a meaningful margin for the value of being a member? Ron, anything you want to add on that?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nNo. I think that that's accurate. Then expansion around the world. I think you'll continue to see an equal amount of 30 warehouses opening up over the next few years, for sure. A good portion of those being out of the US. We see some great opportunities in Canada, and Mexico have been strong countries for us. We continue to see growth opportunities both in Europe and Asia as well.\nSo some of these projects take a lot longer than other ones will, so they'll come on at different times. But I think the outline of 30 a year seems very realistic, and a good portion of those, not quite half, to be outside of the US.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to get Gary to go back to your comment that core margins ex gas were up 17 basis points, and you called out mix and credit card co-brand program. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what's driving that?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Yeah, thanks, Rupesh. Overall, as you mentioned, we were pleased with where reported gross margin rate came in. We tend to look at it ex-gas deflation, as you know, and that was up 7 basis points, and then core-on-core was up 3. So I think the overall message is that things were stable when we look at the gross margin rate. There were a number of puts and takes in that that largely offset each other within the overall results.\nThe main headwind, as we signaled potentially could be the case, was around gas, which was impacted by the fact that we had a major event, obviously, 12 months ago or so in the Middle East that created volatility, and often that can create some strange margin performance, and we were cycling that. So that was the large headwind. I wouldn't say overall that we've seen in the long term gas margins be unpredictable.\nIt just tends to be more unpredictable on an individual quarter when you have that volatility. So that was the sort of biggest headwind. And then offsetting that in the quarter, we had some benefit again this quarter from e-commerce as margins improved there, and the rate of improvement in e-commerce would have been largely similar to what we saw last quarter. So we were pleased with the progress we continue to see there. And then, as you mentioned, in the core, we had a couple of offsets. We saw some benefit from mix as we look at the business. And then secondly, we saw some benefit from the co-brand credit card program, as you mentioned.\nEssentially, the way the credit card co-brand works is that we fund a portion of the rewards that are paid to members, and then we receive various incentives and payments from our issuing bank, and all that flows into gross margin. And essentially, the net effect of that was favorable for the quarter, which, along with mix and the e-commerce benefits, offset the gas headwind. So as I mentioned, overall, I think there were no major takeaways from the puts and takes, but we were pleased that gross margin was up slightly, even though we continued to invest in lower prices and deliver more value for the member.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you for all the color. Happy holidays.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou too.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOh, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe, Ron, for you on the runway for growth in the US. You said 30 new clubs per year next handful of years here. Most of those are going to be in the US. You guys are just over 600 right now. I think if you include the other two players, we're talking about 1,400-plus clubs in the US. They're growing as well. How do you think about maybe the capacity for the club industry in the US and maybe for Costco in particular? What are you seeing that gives you confidence in your ability to keep going at this pace in the US?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think the one thing I see is continued success of operations like I spoke of Pleasanton, California, that we opened the day before Thanksgiving. Right in between three high-volume Bay Area locations in the East Bay, and we opened this warehouse up not long ago, and even finding incremental business, significant incremental business from our members. As we relieve the pressure off of those high-volume warehouses, we see the existing member base coming more frequently, and the buildback is quite nice for us. So we see incrementality of the new warehouse, and then we see very, very quick buildback on those as well.\nSo not only do we still see some opportunities. Scarborough, Maine, we opened over a year ago. Building has had a tremendous first year in a smaller market like that that we see. So we see some runway for a few years ahead of us yet where we have a combination of new markets, but we really are focusing on how do we continue to improve that member experience by relieving pressure off of some of these super high-volume warehouses, and we're finding it to be incremental to the business.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I wanted to circle back on e-commerce, the growth there, 13%. Could you update us on what the penetration is now and also how, if you add on Instacart and I guess the Uber Eats start, where we're getting up to on that?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Greg, for the question. Yeah, we were pleased with the growth that we saw in digital. I think it's important to remember as well, as we shared in the November sales release, that there was some impact of timing of calendar as well. So the 13%, if you think about, I think we shared, the team shared that we were like a 15% headwind in our November sales results. And so truly, if you take about 1/3 of that, you wouldn't be a million miles out with the impact that it would have had on our sales in the quarter as well.\nSo we were pleased overall with the underlying trend and the metrics that we saw around app downloads, traffic, and average order were all up as well, which was encouraging. If you think about the mix of the business, it would be in the sort of, from the numbers that we disclose publicly as being part of our digital business in the sort of 7% to 8% range of our total sales. So as you know, it continues to outpace our overall growth, and we expect that trend to continue. You're exactly right that when you recognize how we define it compared to how others define it, we wouldn't include some of those third-party sites that are delivering.\nAnd there's a few other business parts of our business that we don't include in there as well that would fit in under other businesses. When we add those in there and when you sort of strip out gas, which I think most companies do when they compare, we'd be north of 10% in terms of total penetration of e-commerce sales.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Thanks. And then maybe circling back on private label, could you just update us now on the penetration, especially given some of those great new items you've come out with that you highlighted earlier in the call, and what that could eventually be?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, I think it's up about 30%, almost 33% at this point in the US, is where we've now hit. And that's primarily the food and sundry side of things where we see the majority of our private label. But we're just bumping up against 33%, and it's growing a little faster than the rest of the business.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great, guys. Have a great holiday.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou as well.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you. You too. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and CEO, R5 Capital\n\nThanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to kind of maybe ask a higher-level question around your business. The traffic growth, which is the lifeblood of a retailer, has been very strong given the size of the company. You talked about the Pleasanton opening. So I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of what you think is driving this. Is it the club format generally resonating, consumer mindset, initiatives? And how do we think of like two or four years from now? Is it the numbers this time?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're breaking. We've lost you halfway through the questions. I'm sorry.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and CEO, R5 Capital\n\nI apologize. I don't know why that happened. You guys are clear as a bell. Actually, to set up this type of traffic growth is your initiatives, the industry mindset, and what your thoughts are about keeping this type of traffic going for years.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOkay. I think we got most of your questions, and it really revolves around traffic growth and what we see that happening and if we feel that that can continue on. That's what I'll try to answer, and hopefully, that was what you're talking about. I think from some of the comments you made, I think it's all of the above. Some of the fun facts I gave out there was just really to point to the growth success we're seeing in several parts of our company, be it the pharmacy, the food court, and our fresh foods area.\nI've got to contribute a big part of that to our buyers and operators and the work that they're doing in keeping relevance to the member needs and being reflective of what we're focusing on, some of the lower-cost proteins for some of our members, while we're focusing on the Wagyu for the members that would like those goods as well. So I think our people are doing a tremendous job knowing our customer, but it really is all parts of the business are contributing. Their tire business is very strong. Our non-food business continues to strengthen. E-commerce is doing their part. And it just goes back to execution from the teams.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Thanks for taking my question. It's on competitive impacts, so it may end up sounding like more than one question. But are there any competitive impacts you guys are seeing worth calling out, benefits or headwinds? So maybe remind us when a regional player you compete with raises their membership fee. Does that help you guys at all retain or retention rates, things like that? And also, I know you've been asked this, but any pressures you're seeing on the fact that you guys don't do Scan & Go and Sam's seems to be doing really well with it and any other competitive impacts you can call out? Thanks.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Robbie. I think we're generally our own biggest competitor, honestly. That's generally how we approach the business. Maybe the couple of trends that add some color on that that I would call out would be we haven't talked for some time about cannibalizing our own business with opening new warehouses. And as Ron mentioned, generally, we're seeing significant incrementality. But as we have opened more warehouses, we certainly create some of that. We don't split it out in our numbers. We just flow it through our results, but it does impact the number because we are moving some traffic from existing warehouses when we open a new one.\nI think from a competitive point of view, I guess the biggest tailwind I would call out, and Ron mentioned it briefly in prepared comments around our business, is that obviously we're seeing quite a lot of disruption in the retail pharmacy business right now.\nAnd I think with the work our teams are doing to deliver great value for the member and continuing to improve the experience and make it easier to engage with our pharmacists, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we're seeing significant growth in that business today. I think that's partly the work that we're doing and partly I think there is some disruption in the industry currently as well.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd just any comments on Scan & Go and maybe remind us why that might not be on your agenda?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation",
    "content2": "I mean, I think we've got our job, as Gary said, to take care of the members and make sure that they move through. Do we hear about Scan & Go? Yes, we do. Self-checkout has been a great option for our members, and we focus on that.\nOur job really is that we will continue to keep an eye on technology and how we can improve that front-end experience. That is the one pinch point. That was the focus of our door scanners as we took a lot of pressure off of the cashiers and moving lines through and saw some nice productivity enhancements when we did that. But at this point, it's not something we're hearing quite often. We do hear it randomly, but we're going to keep an eye out there on technology and make sure that we're doing our part to keep the experience as strong as we can for our members.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the recent sales contribution from categories like precious metals and gift cards, have you, A, expanded the aperture of what Costco is now willing to sell or what the member is willing to buy from Costco? And B, have you changed your philosophy on the margin where you are expecting more profitability from traditional product vendors to offset the negative margin impact from selling these items that don't drive a lot of profit? Thank you very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think as far as new categories, you go back to caskets that we started many years ago that we would never have thought would have been a business for us. And we were able to find a way to deliver great member value and great quality.\nAnd that was, such as the addition to gasoline we had many years ago in the company as well, is that: can we find something that meets the needs of our members and ensure we can deliver the right quality and the great price? So I think the tickets and precious metals was, again, great work by our buying teams and finding new areas that we can deliver great quality and great value to our members. And I see them working hard on the next categories that are going to be coming for us. But that's part of the treasure hunt at Costco, is always keeping nimble and continue to change those categories that we can find new areas to improve the lives of our members.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Maybe Ron, just to add on that, Michael, to your question, I think we'd give a bit more credit in addition to Ron's point about its great work by our merchants creating new and exciting items. We give a bit more credit, I think, to the impact they have on the business, not necessarily because we see significant margin, as you mentioned, from them, but they're driving significant traffic to our website, and we do get a high proportion of cross-selling when members are buying things like precious metals. So it's driving our ability to grow our digital business overall. And I think we see it as something that also just creates a lot of awareness about our e-commerce business as well.\nSo as you know, we don't advertise, but it's identifying these exciting items that help drive traffic and awareness of what Costco offers. And I think some of that is a factor in what helps with the continued growth in e-commerce, not just from a top-line perspective, but also the margin improvement that we talked about on the call. So I think we would look at it a little bit more broadly, for sure.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nBut just to clarify that second point, are you having to offset the margin impact from selling these traffic-driving items that don't carry a lot of margin by requiring even better margins on the rest of the assortment?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nNow, what we're seeing is we're driving a mix improvement overall because of the traffic that it's driving and the engagement with the website. And remember, of course, as well, that there's very low SG&A costs associated with that product, so it also helps create leverage in the e-commerce model as well.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSo yeah, so the answer is really no. We're not making more margin on those other items to offset that. We're just driving down our SG&A, so we don't require more margin.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and have a good holiday.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou as well. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, thanks very much. Ron, can you talk about Costco's right to earn more wallet share with your more affluent, higher-income shopper, particularly on the discretionary side of the business? And then Gary, just on the margin bridge, can you just explain why the 2% rebate was favorable, five basis points? Historically, it's almost always negative or neutral. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure thing. Chuck, your question was, why are we gaining more market share with our affluent customers? Is that what your question was?\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nNo, my question is, do you think you've earned the right to earn more wallet share with that higher-income shopper?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. I think we do. I think as we continue to find the brands, I mean, and deliver also with great quality Kirkland Signature, we will continue to see that growth and that customer. We resonate. That is our member, and that's who we cater our mixes to. And I think that we see great runway for us in the future.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd then, Chuck, on the second part of your question, so with the 2% rewards, think of it as that throughout the year, we're accruing what we believe is the right amount of redemption for the 2% rewards. And generally speaking, we're going to be conservative around that because we want to make sure we're fully accrued.\nAnd then when we get into the Q1 each year, we're sort of truing up, if you like, what the actual spend was. So I'd almost think of the adjustment this quarter sort of offsetting the increases that we saw in the back half of last year. And so you have to net those out to say underlying there is a gradual increase in the 2% spend, but it kind of nets off between quarter by quarter.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. So it was essentially a true-up then. Right. Okay. Great. Awesome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our questions, Ron and Gary. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your partnerships with Instacart and Uber, now that you've had Uber for quite some time. What you've learned, what is the pace of growth, and how that's adding to comps, and just general awareness among your membership base of the service there, particularly as you add new services, like you mentioned, the pharmacy, I guess, coming in and what something like that could do to the growth there.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. I guess I will start with that. Very strong partnerships with both organizations. We've closely looked at what the behaviors of the members were and found great incrementality to our members. Shop frequency goes way up, and it changes the shopping habits. I think they'll use us more for a fill-in between their big Costco brick-and-mortar shop to go into an Instacart or an Uber and shop those directions.\nSo I think that we're finding that it's the most cost-effective way to do some small non-food item deliveries as well, where we would have otherwise shipped those via UPS or a carrier from a distribution center. We can now have those to a member within a few hours. So if you're looking for a blender that will fit in the back of a Prius, we can get that to you in a couple of hours at a very low cost. So it's improving our e-commerce delivery speed, time to the member, and conveniences there as well. So we're very happy with the partnership. Our head merchant works very closely with both of those organizations, and we think it's a great service for their members.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI guess the only thing to add, Kelly, is the first part of your question. It continues to grow very strongly, so at least in line with the pace that we see in our digital business overall.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYep. Slightly higher than our e-commerce business growth.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Cerankosky\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about labor relations and the current negotiations with the Teamsters, please?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI guess what I will say about that is that at Costco, we will always take care of our employees as we always have done. That means that we're going to focus on a fair and a timely process for getting to an agreement with the Teamsters.\nWe have a 40-year track record of dealing fairly with the Teamsters union, and really nothing has changed about that. So these are Costco employees. They're of great importance to us, and we're going to do everything as we can to take care of those employees as we do all of our employees.\n\nChuck Cerankosky\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior Vice President of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the international performance that you saw. Comps decelerated on a multi-year stack versus Q4. So just curious by region if there's anything to call out that changed versus the prior quarters. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Corey. I don't think there's anything we'd be particularly calling out. I mean, there's certainly some nuances sometimes between some of the international markets of when certain holidays fall, and they would have had, I'll give you an example which I wasn't familiar with before joining the company and having recent conversations, that in Taiwan, there's a big impact from the holiday season in the same way there is here around Black Friday. And so there are nuances like that that we see in individual markets that sometimes can affect the calendar.\nBut overall, we've been pleased with the momentum that we've seen in the international businesses, and we continue to see strong growth relative to both our own internal expectations and then also as we look at the growth in those markets, how we continue to grow our market share. So nothing I would call out as being unusual there.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior Vice President of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nThanks for taking my question. It's a follow-up on your digital business, which obviously is growing well, but how would senior management diagnose or grade your online presence from a look, feel, and function perspective relative to your competition? And related to that, this growth in members who are joining online, is that something you're driving, or is that just an output of the attractiveness of your online offer?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. I think, again, I'll say we're probably our own toughest critic. I think when we look at our business overall and we look at the growth over the last 10 years, we've actually grown at a faster pace than the e-commerce sort of business in the US has grown in general.\nSo in one respect, we're very pleased with the momentum and the growth that we've seen and continuing to see that higher engagement. But we're never satisfied. We believe there's more work we can do to keep improving the member experience. We made recent changes with things like search functionality and making inventory available through the mobile app. And those changes are certainly, members are seeing the benefit of that and commenting positively on the changes that we're seeing.\nBut we know that we're on a technology journey. We've sort of been building the foundations of that journey over the last few years, and the goal is to keep getting better and to keep enhancing the member experience. So I'd say we still believe there's more work to do, and we believe by doing that work, we can continue growing our digital business even more effectively.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident, CEO, and Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd I would add to that, we realize that we do have some opportunity. We definitely see that we can continue to improve. Gary's exactly right. We're doing the back of the house work at this point: speed, stability, making sure that all the foundational work is done so we can build on that. And then I think in short order, people will start seeing the front side of things that will come in. But I think Costco Logistics is a great example of the progress we've made. We are now able to pre-deploy things around the US and have deliveries made in four days, which a couple of years ago would have taken us two weeks.\nSo we're seeing the distribution centers coming online. We're starting to see the app usage go way up, functionalities being added to that as well. So it's a journey. We're going to start seeing some more forward-facing improvements in the next 12 months as we sort of start putting our logistics side behind us and we get those things taken care of. And as far as the e-commerce engagement with membership signups, probably the biggest difference is that we have less Executive Members sign up online, which do renew at a higher basis.\nAnd I think that that big part of that is that they don't have an employee to talk to when they're making that transaction, and they don't understand all the benefits of the Executive Membership. So we're able to capture those later on the path. But that's the first thing we see there is that at least we start engaging with them as a member, and then we will work on showing them the benefits of the Executive Membership down the road.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Q3 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question at that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw that question again, press star one. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Gary, you may begin your conference.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to be part of the Costco team, and it's a pleasure to be hosting my first Costco quarterly conference call. The whole Costco team has been incredibly welcoming, and as you might imagine, my first three months working alongside Richard have been a lot of fun. It's also been great visiting warehouses and facilities to immerse myself in the Costco culture and experience firsthand how this is positioning the company for continued growth.\nOver recent months, I've spent time and met with many analysts and investors, several of whom I know through my prior role, and it's clear you value and appreciate the company's current approach to investor communications. While I can't promise to be able to match the humor that Richard Galanti has become famous for, I can promise the same level of open dialogue and transparency you've come to expect. Oh, and to clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe.\nBefore I talk about our results, I wanted to mention that Ron Vachris is also joined today's call. Many of you have expressed interest in hearing from Ron, and so we thought it would be a good idea to have Ron join the discussion, and he can also take a few questions. Ron, would you like to add anything before we talk about the quarter?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Gary. And again, welcome to Costco. I'm very happy to report that the transition from Richard to Gary has gone very well, and we're very excited to have Gary on board as part of Costco, and I look forward to working together on the growth opportunities ahead for our company. Before we jump into the quarter, I wanted to make a couple of comments on the leadership transition. As Richard has mentioned on previous calls, I've worked closely with Craig Jelinek for many years, including side by side for the last two years as President, and so the CEO transition has been very seamless process.\nSince January, my time has been focused on working closely with the teams around the world to ensure we continue to deliver the best quality merchandise at a best value for our members. I'm incredibly proud of our employees, and I believe our consistency of results is a reflection of their commitment to our members and to each other, consistent with how Craig and Richard manage investor communications. I intend to have Gary host the quarterly conference calls, and I will join his business remarks to answer a few questions. So Gary, let's go to the results, and I'm happy to jump back in for the Q and A portion to field some questions today.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks Ron. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the Q3 of fiscal 2024, the twelve weeks ended 12 May 2024.\nBefore I walk through all the new numbers for this quarter, we are making available a slide presentation on our investor site under Events and Presentations. These slides summarize much of the information I will share today, including Richard's famous matrices. We intend to make this information available every quarter.\nReported net income for the Q3 came in at $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per diluted share, up from $1.3 billion and $2.93 per diluted share in the Q3 last year. Last year's results included a non-recurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Net sales for Q3 were $57.39 billion, an increase of 9.1% from $52.6 billion in Q3 last year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year over year and comparable retail weeks. US comp sales were 6.2% or 6% adjusted for gas inflation and FX.\nCanada was 7.7% or 7.4% adjusted. Other International was 7.7% or 8.5% adjusted, and this led to total company comp sales of 6.6% or 6.5% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Finally, E-commerce comp sales were 20.7% both on a reported basis and adjusted for foreign exchange. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.1% worldwide and 5.5% in the US. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.5% worldwide and up 0.7% in the US. Foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 20 basis points while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points.\nMoving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1,123,000,000, an increase of $79,000,000 or 7.6% year over year. Membership fee income growth was 8% excluding FX. In terms of renewal rates at Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 93%, up 0.1% from Q2 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q2 end. We ended Q3 with 74.5 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 133.9 million cardholders, up 7.4% year over year. At Q3 end, we had 34.5 million paid Executive Memberships, an increase of 661,000 since Q2 end.\nExecutive Members now represent over 46% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Our reported gross margin rate in the Q3 was higher year over year by 52 basis points, coming in at 10.84% compared to 10.32% last year and up 54 basis points excluding gas inflation. Core was flat and higher by 2 basis points without gas inflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 10 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was lower six basis points and lower five basis points excluding gas inflation. This decrease year over year was driven by gas, partially offset by e-commerce.\n2% Reward was lower by 1 basis point both with and without gas inflation, with higher sales penetration coming from our Executive Members. LIFO was a benefit of 2 basis points. We had an $11 million LIFO credit in Q3 this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in Q3 last year. This is the third LIFO credit this year following a $15 million LIFO credit in Q1 and a $14 million credit in Q2. And finally, other was higher 57 basis points or 56 basis points excluding gas inflation. This was all related to lapping last year's negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge for charter shipping activities.\nMoving on to SG&A, our reported SG&A rate in the Q3 was lower or better year over year by 15 basis points, coming in this year at 8.96% compared to last year's 9.11%. SG&A was lower year over year by 12 basis points adjusted for gas inflation. The operations component of SG&A was lower by 14 basis points and lower by 12 basis points excluding the impact from gas inflation. Despite an increase in warehouse wages this year, higher labor productivity and great cost discipline by our operators drove the improved core SG&A results for the quarter.\nAll was better by one basis point and flat without gas, inflation, and stock compensation, and pre-opening were both flat year over year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $36 million last year, and interest income and other for the quarter was flat year over year as lower interest income was offset by a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.4% compared to 26.5% in Q3 last year. Overall reported net income was up 29.1% year over year, and excluding last year's charge related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, it was up 10.3% year over year.\nA few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion in the Q3, we opened two new warehouses, but both in the US. Additionally, since the end of Q3 we had two more openings. Last week we opened in Loomis, California, and two days ago we opened our seventh building in China in the Nanjing market. For the remainder of fiscal 2024 we plan to open another 12 new locations, nine in the US, two in Japan, and one in Korea.\nThis would bring the total for the full year to 30 openings including one relocation for a net of 29 new warehouses. Regarding capital expenditures, Q3 spend was approximately $1.06 billion, and we estimate full year 2024 capital expenditure will be between $4.3 and 4.5 billion. Diving a bit deeper into some of the key themes we saw during the quarter, Non-Foods had the highest comps of our core categories. This strength was aided by lapping some softness in sales a year ago, but was really driven by our merchandising teams doing a great job identifying high quality items with values that really resonated with our members and buying those items with conviction.\nAs inflation has leveled off, our members are returning to purchasing more discretionary items, and growth in the category was led by toys, tires, lawn and garden, and health and beauty aids. Bakery sales also showed great momentum in the quarter as our Fresh Foods team has reinvented that department with a number of new and exciting items including the Kirkland Signature Lemon Blueberry Loaf and Morning Buns. Within our ancillary businesses, the Food Court had the strongest quarterly sales with continued success of the chocolate chip cookie that was added to the Food Court this year.\nOn the inflation front, it's more of the same from last quarter. Across all core merchandise, inflation was essentially flat in Q3, with Fresh foods close to zero and slight inflation in Fresh Foods being offset by some deflation in Non-Foods. The deflation in Non-Foods was led by hardware, sporting goods, and furniture, all still benefiting from lower freight costs year over year. Keep in mind that when we speak to inflation or, in the case of Non-Foods, deflation, we're referring to our selling prices.\nWe're intentionally creating incremental value for our members by delivering lower prices wherever possible. We believe our strategy of delivering value to drive unit volume and member satisfaction is the winning combination for us. In that vein, our buying teams are constantly aware of changing costs across all of their SKUs and are ensuring that we are capturing all cost decreases quickly so that we can pass on incremental value through price reductions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering ultimate value with branded goods, we evaluate the potential for new, high quality Kirkland Signature items with a goal of providing at least 20% value versus what we would sell the national brand item at.\nThis quarter, we released a new Kirkland Signature Men's Walking Shoe and new Kirkland Signature Facial Wipes, both of which are doing very well. We also reduced prices on a number of existing items, including lowering Kirkland Signature pine nuts from $29.99 to $24.99 and reducing the price of our Kirkland Signature frozen shrimp SKUs by $1. These are just a couple of examples that came out of our recent monthly budget meetings where each country and region shares new and exciting items they have introduced to their warehouses and items where they've lowered prices.\nTurning now to digital, we continue to make enhancements to the app and website and are excited about the traction that these initiatives are getting with members. Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter was led by gold and silver bullion, gift cards, and appliances. In appliances, Costco Logistics is playing a key role in providing both greater value and a better end-to-end experience for members. Deliveries through Costco Logistics were up 28% in the quarter. Costco Next. Our curated marketplace also continues to grow nicely, and we added eight new vendors in Q3, bringing the total to 75.\nOur app downloads were up 32% versus a year ago with about 2.5 million new downloads in the quarter, bringing total downloads to more than 35 million. Site traffic was up 16% and average order value was up 8%. You may have also recently seen an announcement that we are expanding our relationship with Uber. Previously, Uber Eats delivered Costco orders in Texas, and this new agreement allows consumers the ability to order from Costco through Uber Eats across all of Canada as well as 17 states in the US. We are also working to expand this partnership to several of our international countries in the coming months.\nIn addition to the increased access to Uber Eats customers, the agreement will allow us to sell Uber gift cards globally and offer discounted Uber One annual membership to Costco members. Finally, in terms of our upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, 2 June on Wednesday, 5 June after market close. Also remember that our fiscal Q4 ending 1 September 2024 will have 16 weeks versus the 17 weeks in the fiscal Q4 last year. With that, we will now open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question again, press Star one and please limit yourself to one question in a single follow up. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood afternoon. Hey Gary, how are you doing?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nHi Simeon.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nWe're going to take a stab at this membership question. The way that we've thought about it is it's an inflation offset to the model, and it was described as if you have enough levers in the middle of the P&L to deliver whatever stated EBIT growth you're trying to do, you didn't need to touch the membership fee. Is that still the way that you look at it? And is that visibility on enough levers still intact?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Simeon. And you're talking about a membership fee increase now? Is that where your question is coming from? Correct? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. You know, I would really kind of revert back to some of the comments that Richard shared previously. I don't think that we're thinking about it any differently than he's talked about in the last few calls. You know, we've historically looked at increasing the membership fee every five years or so, and obviously we're beyond that time period now in terms of what would be the typical cycle. There's nothing about anything that we see within how the business is performing that's changing our view on that.\nWe feel really good about membership renewal rates. We feel really good about the test of are we delivering significantly more value to members than we were or have since we last increased the membership fee. But I think we are our own probably toughest competitor in that we look at what's happened in the marketplace over the last few years and when we were seeing high inflation and the risk and concern around recession. I know before I joined the company it was talked about extensively, and it continues to be talked about as it's something that is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if we increase the fee.\nBut we're still evaluating those considerations to determine what the right timing is, and when we reach that point where we feel it is the right time, of course, we will be very open and direct in communicating that. Okay, fair enough. Can I ask about your opinion on the US expansion? It's been holding in a lot better. It's been more giving than we would have thought several years ago. Do you have any thoughts? Just your own perspective. You're probably looking at members per warehouse. Are you surprised at the runway you still have in the US? Do you think it could be even more than what we're aware of today? Less. Just curious if there's anything surprising on that item.\nI think it's only surprising in as much as I know we've talked previously about. We thought that we would potentially run out of runway for new warehouses in the US, and as you know, this year we're opening close to 29 net new warehouses, and many of those will continue in the US, and we still see significant runway to continue opening more warehouses in the US in the future. I think that sort of 25 to 30 new warehouse count is a reasonable proxy for what we think the runway is for the foreseeable future for new warehouses. I'd be surprised if at least half of those weren't continuing to be in the US because we still see significant growth when we open those new warehouses.\nAnd what it's doing for us in filling markets is it's creating capacity for our members that are shopping very busy warehouses today to be able to shop more frequently and drive more engagement with us. And also it increases membership renewal rates over time as well. So I think we still see plenty of runway in the US to continue to open more warehouses. But we also see a lot of growth opportunity, of course, in the international markets as well.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks Gary. Appreciate it.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOf course. Thanks, Simeon.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my question. There's been a lot of announcements from consumable retailers in recent times about making price investments. Do you think you need to make a sizable price investment in the next couple of quarters in order to remain competitive?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThis is Ron Vachris. No, I think that this is part of our everyday DNA. I mean we are competitive on a daily basis. Our buyers are on top of pricing daily, weekly, and we all review them each month. And so we feel very good about where we are today and our runway to continue to be as competitive as we are moving forward.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMy follow-up question is; given some of the changes in leadership over the last year or so, is there any thought given to being more aggressive with some of the evolution on the model, things like buy online, pick up in store, deploying more technology in the store, or capitalizing on the ever so great amounts of data that Costco has in the form of trying to monetize it through retail media? Thank you very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think the answer to that is yes on all those fronts. We are working on all those aspects. Right now we're rolling out an expanded Buy Online, Pick Up in Warehouse that is always going to be limited in scope based on the volume in our warehouses that we have. We can't expand to all categories, but we're expanding as we currently speak in televisions and other electronic items that are there. And so yeah, we see that as a real opportunity for us. Technology is going to be one of our key priorities moving forward. How do we improve that member engagement and the relationship we have with them in our brick and mortar warehouses as well as online and through other aspects such as travel and so forth.\nSo technology we see as a great opportunity to enhance the member relationship with Costco and also drive a lot more business for us as well as we move forward. So we're going to continually innovate. I mean, you know, with the management changes, I wouldn't expect major changes as we have a proven strategy now, but as we've done for the past 41 years, we continue to innovate to the needs of our members.\nOh, and the last on data, absolutely. You know, we see a great opportunity for data. We have expanded our group there. We have a significant program now with retail media, and we see some great upside potential. We've expanded that team, and we see some good potential and some good runway for us in that as well. Things like personalization and so forth.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, good afternoon and congrats again, Gary. Historically, Richard and team have been steadfast on the 14% to 15% margin ceiling which has clearly paid dividends for the company over the years. I'm curious about how you and Ron view this threshold. Are you going to adhere to it? Do you think you're going to earn more? Just your thoughts on the margin front?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nNo. That 14 to 15% has been part of our life for many years, and so I think that's our objective. Our buyers goals is really how aggressive they can get on pricing and deliver the best value. So I don't see there's no plans to move that cap at all.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nChuck, maybe just one thing to build on that too. I think as you think about some of the opportunities that Ron mentioned on the earlier call, completely echoes Ron's comment about we have a really clear growth strategy that's obviously delivering momentum in the company today. These opportunities through technology and media I think are great opportunities for us to find new ways to unlock value. But again, I think see those very much in the mindset of how do we give 90% back to the member so that we're continuing to drive member engagement, member loyalty, and member value.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay, great. And then just to kind of build off Michael's question, just wanted to get your high-level thoughts on digital e-comm. What do you think Costco's strengths are? What do you think the weaknesses are today, and where do you think the biggest focus is going to be for the company in the coming years?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, our biggest strength on digital e-commerce is of course the merchandise and the value that we have. I mean, that's what works for us in our brick and mortar. You know, the technology, the systems that we have. You know, the teams have got a great roadmap of where they're going. A lot of the work that's being done right now is very foundational. So, you know, better fulfillment, quicker delivery times, you know, reliability of the site, those type of things. So those are the things. And then following that will come iterative changes of forward facing improvements that you'll see on the sites and move forward. So I think we've got a very good roadmap to do that.\nBut I think that, I think personalization is a big deal for members that we could do a much better job on, and also a better correlation of the warehouse and the online business. You know, we're working towards warehouse inventory online so members could use that on the app. But app functionality is one of our greatest opportunities.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks Chuck.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThanks, guys. Scott Ciccarelli. So given the strength of your discretionary sales following the lull that we've seen with, as the economy got a little funky, does that suggest your members are starting to feel better and more willing to spend on wants rather than needs?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, it does indeed look that way. I've got to tell you that the discretionary spend we're seeing, I mean, we're definitely winning in consumables as we see the food business, and, you know, dining away from home has softened up a bit, and people are eating, and we're seeing that in our Fresh foods. But I have to tell you that categories such as the home division, toys are categories that have lagged quite a bit post-COVID, that with great excitement.\nI mean, our buyers have come out and delivered some great items, have phenomenal values, have really rejuvenated those categories. And those are both leading categories for us in sporting goods, toys, you know, furnishings, domestics; all those categories are really coming on very strong now, and all of a discretionary nature.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nFascinating. And then today we had a presentation. Obviously Ron, you joined the call. Are there other changes we could potentially expect given some of the C-suite changes?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI mean, again, like I said, you know, there's no major changes planned. The team is the team that's been running this company for some time. Gary has been a great addition to us and is contributing nicely. But you know, our model is working; it's working around the world. Great value on quality merchandise seems to resonate in every region that we do business. So we'll continue to innovate, we'll continue to see new things and be relative to what our members' needs are. But I can't sit here today and tell you to expect anything, any great momentous changes in the near future. We just want to continue to execute well.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAnd Scott, maybe just to add from my perspective of being new to the role and new to the company, early observations for me, obviously the incredibly impressed with the culture and the strategy is clearly working very well. So my first priority is to really being new to the company is to really acclimatize and to support and enable a smooth transition with the culture to make sure the momentum that we have continues going forward. And I think the other point as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call, is we're on a journey with technology and data and so hopefully there's things that I can bring to work with the team and help us continuing on that journey and accelerate that journey. And really that's the priorities in my mind, being new into the CFO role.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nVery helpful. Thanks guys.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks for taking our questions. Ron and Gary, pleasure to have you both on the call, and love the slides. Thank you. Wanted to just maybe go back a little bit to retail media strategy and personalization. I think, Ron, you noted a hire or maybe some key hires in that department. Gary, I think you bring a unique perspective to this area or both of these areas. So, I guess, just can you help size up the opportunity for us on these two fronts in retail media and personalization? Is it at all different than a typical retailer because of Costco's unique model and SKU count or, or anything along those lines? And I guess, would your plans in these areas include any increase in technology spend in coming years?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, I'll go first and then Ron may want to add some color as well. You know, I think many of your comments are relevant to how we think about the opportunity. You know, from the first thing, I guess I would say as being new and having joined the company is as you think about where a lot of companies talk about alternative profit streams, there are a lot of areas today where Costco is doing great things in that area today. So, using the strength of the membership relationship in driving a very large co-brand payment program that delivers value to members and delivers value to the company.\nThe travel services business that we have, which is pretty unique in retail but, I think, in any other company would be viewed as a way of generating new revenue and alternative revenue streams from sort of expanding from that overall retail relationship. And then thirdly, I would say we have media revenue today in areas of the business. So it's not as though it isn't something that actually the business is delivering on today.\nBut I think, as Ron mentioned in an earlier comment, that as technology and data are something that we're sort of building a path towards, I would still say there's significant opportunity for us to grow in that space because of the unique nature of the relationship we have with our members and the ways in which we can deliver value for them and tap into that data and tap into the growth that we're creating both in the warehouse and through digital channels. I think it's a little bit early to sort of size it in totality, because you're right. There are also some unique elements about our model that would make our opportunity a little bit different.\nBut from what we know today and from the team that's been brought in to help the company think through it, we certainly believe it's got significant runway to drive a lot of growth for the company. And as I mentioned earlier though, I would definitely think of it as something that we'll look at to, as we do with everything, reinvest in the member to really accelerate the growth of the company overall.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI would have to mirror what Gary says. We do have a unique model. We have a relationship with all of our members. Our responsibility is to use that data wisely and respectfully. As far as IT spend, yeah, there will be some IT spends. As we look in the future, we don't see that to be anything that will really change our trajectory of our cap investments. But there will be some IT requirements, but we feel that will be in the normal course of business.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, Kelly.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGuys, I want to go back to personalization again. Where do you think, just conceptually, the biggest opportunities are? Right, when you think about wallet share, every one of your members is going to be a little different, but you can probably do cohorts. Where are they not buying from you and why? Personalized promotions, outreach on new items coming into the warehouse. Where do you think that the biggest opportunities are to build further wallet share?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nJohn, I'll go ahead and start out. I think the biggest opportunity is just like you said, the awareness of the warehouse and keeping our members in tune on what's active, what's going on in the warehouse near them, and how we can continue to enhance and drive those sales. I think that that's probably our greatest opportunity with digital as we see moving forward. You know, personalization is good. We talk here a lot about.\nA fair, reasonable amount of personalization. We never want to compromise the treasure hunt of Costco. And that's equally as important as people that go to Costco.com never knew that they needed a 16 foot shed and they see a phenomenal value as they do in the warehouse. And so we don't want to personalize to a detriment. You know, that changes our DNA and who we are. But we do know that there's definitely some improvements we could have that would enhance the member experience. And that's everything that our team is focused on is that how does this move to the member and how does it improve their experience with us digitally?\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nOkay, maybe. Then, as a follow-up, Gary, you talked a little bit about the core-on-core, but maybe you step back a little bit if you. I know the idea is not necessarily to maximize margin, but maybe some thoughts core-on-core this quarter. I know; I think there had been pressure on Fresh, right? As you kind of normalized post-COVID back to a regular level. Are we now through that process of Fresh getting back down to a certain level?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Just maybe to give you a little bit more color on the core-on-core, how it kind of played out during the quarter. So if you think about the three main categories in core between Foods and Sundries, Fresh, and Non-Foods, Fresh would have continued to been slightly lower year over year. And that's a very deliberate strategy for us to make sure we're delivering more value for the member. And we think that's a really important place for us to drive member engagement and support, especially as we're still seeing some commodities that are a little bit inflationary right now. So that would have been very much part of the plan from our perspective.\nBut it was more than offset, as you mentioned, by the improvement in Non-Foods during the quarter, which was what led to the 10 basis points improvement on core-on-core. Fresh Foods actually was pretty flat overall. So we feel good about the way that we're managing the balance while staying true to that principle of delivering the best value for the member. And we were pleased with how it played out during the quarter based on the work all the merchandising teams did.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter, if you're on mute?\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nSorry about that. Yeah, sorry about that guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ron, maybe one for you. Just kind of back to the member behavior. Maybe back to Scott's question a little bit. Can you just talk about your observations around maybe income cohorts? Any other ways you bucket or slice your membership base? Just how the behaviors have evolved here over the last several months, is there any change that you think is interesting to call out? You talked about the better general Non-Foods trends. Just curious if this environment reminds you of anything else historically. That's my first question.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOkay. You know, it's a very healthy environment from what we see from our members right now. As you take a category such as our meat department, which is growing very nicely, a lot of volume being driven in ground beef and our new everyday lower price on boneless skinless chicken breasts, really driving a lot of volume there. While Wagyu beef and prime are growing at a great clip for us as well. We're seeing that benefit from both sides of the consumer. That great value in both areas are doing very well. The Non-Foods, I tell you that Non-Foods is strictly driven by newness and excitement. We see Big & Bulky going very well. It's been a year of our $1,200 swing set that we have on the floor. We can't get enough. They're just blowing out.\nIt's again that continuous innovation of merchandise that is exciting our members and really driving some sales for us there. Executive Membership. That drives our executive base. Because people are engaging at a much higher level.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGood. So, sounds good across the board. We're expecting a dryer to get delivered from Costco Logistics in the next couple of days looking forward to that. And then the second question would be. Yeah, Ron or Gary, either one of you, just your view on vertical sourcing I mean, this has been something that Costco has been involved in for several years, going across different categories. As you guys continue to grow your business, you need more, I guess, definable sources of supply. Just curious, your view of vertical sourcing, where you are today and what areas you might focus on over the next several years. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. You know, we've gotten into vertical integration and sourcing as the need arises. And if you think back in the infamous story about the hot dog and Coke at $1.50 and how are you going to figure out how to keep that price there? Well, we're going to open our own meat plants. And as we looked at the prices of optical lenses going up and then we opened up our optical grinding plants, so we did that to continue to look at those things. The chicken plant came because we saw an inflection point where supply was not going to meet demand. So we had to get involved. And because we didn't have a partner that was willing to expand into that area as well.\nThere is a focus that I have the group focused on too, is that let's not try and be everything though. We've got a business to run here, and we're not going to get vertically integrated just because it's something we can do. It really is going to be driven by where the needs are and when do you need to step in. It's equally we have great partners out there that supply our goods for us, and they're long-term suppliers. And so it's, you know, strategically using that relationship is going to be the key in the future. So there's nothing that I could announce at this time that we're going to expand into, but we continue to keep that in our back pocket should we need to.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nPerfect. Thanks so much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Cheatham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey everyone, this is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Recently you were selling Instacart gift cards at a discount online and in warehouse, and thought that was pretty interesting because it's potentially a gift card that could be used at a competitor as well. So I'm just curious, is there any strategy behind that? Are you trying to drive member engagement online? Is there any learnings from that initiative?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, the strategy behind it was another avenue to bring value to our members, is really what that was about, is that, you know, there is an upcharge on having grocery delivered to home. You know, we work closely with Instacart. Now we will with Uber to try and keep those costs at a minimum. But they've got people to pay on their side as well. So the partnership was really to how do we continue to enhance that service for our members and drive more sales. And so that was truly somebody can go out and use that somewhere else. But again, our job is to save the members where we can. And be it airline tickets or, you know, Uber ride tickets or Instacart shopping, we look at all those opportunities to add value to the member.\n\nBrandon Cheatham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGot it, thanks. My follow up; how do warehouses react when you open an infill warehouse. You know, does it open differently than other new markets? Does the current market feel an impact, and how many warehouses that you opened over the past year, would you quantify as infill versus new markets? Thanks.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI guess how they react? You know, we normally have good data before we'll open up an infill building. We can judge based on our member information what cannibalization we'll realize in what building. We're able to get in front of that and adjust labor, payroll, buying, and all those type of things for the upcoming cannibalization that we plan. Our team does a very good job. They're normally within a percent or so of what reality is to the execution of where our plans are as well. We've gotten pretty good at planning those things out. You know, it's strategic. The numbers of cannibalized locations, I'd have to tell you, I'd have to say that we probably opened eight this year that cannibalize other buildings. Some may have cannibalized one warehouse, others may be in the middle.\nWe had one in Toronto that cannibalized four buildings around it, but they built back their sales within six months. Those are the opportunities where, you know, to Gary's earlier point, frequency improves significantly because members can get back into a high volume club. And so it's strategic cannibalization, if you would, as we look around the world.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Ron. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin cap, still very much in place at 14% to 15%. Is there any reason that SG&A now that it's back under 9% of sales couldn't fall to 8 if you keep having the growth that you have?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nNo, that's a very fair, that's a very good point. No, we continue to see, I mean the company, we had a very healthy SG&A number this quarter. You know, inventory was flowing very well. We had Fresh goods coming through the system. Our warehouses did a phenomenal job. SKU counts are in line, and so it's one of those things where all the stars aligned and this is the way we operate. Well, when you can deliver that kind of a top line growth at our size now, our operators do a tremendous job leveraging that to the SG&A. So what could that get to? I'd hate to say 8%, but I do think that we can have continued runway of driving down that number.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great to hear. And maybe some insight on gas gallons in the quarter. I know it was volatile, and there's certainly a point of pressure for a lot of members and consumers. Did that help the traffic acceleration in the quarter? Gas gallon growth?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, we were 5% up in gallons, you know, and again that's, I think, all those things when you can save people on gas, that's also going to lend to your traffic as well. But gallons were up 5% for the quarter.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nA great number. If I could follow up on gas, is that still the profitability in gas, Gary, kind of similar versus a year ago or last quarter, or is that trending up or down?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, the gas profitability would have been down a little bit. I think you may have heard me mention in the prepared comments that when we looked at the overall gross margin rate for the quarter. The sort of headwind that we had was in the ancillary businesses, the other businesses, and it was essentially gas that created that headwind. So we did see a reduction in gas profitability during the quarter. But overall the core-on-core margin improvement, and e-commerce improvement essentially offset that to bring us pretty close to flat overall when you adjust for gas inflation in the results.\nSo it was down. I would say in general, we've seen on gas profitability it's been relatively consistent to slightly improving if you look over the last few years. But obviously there are points in time when you think about volatility in fuel prices where you can have those ups or downs in any given quarter. And that was this last quarter was one where we did see a headwind in year over year gas profitability.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's fantastic. Well, welcome and I'll let somebody else ask about how much gold bullion drove the comp. Take care guys.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nGood afternoon.Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to unit growth, you know, in recent years it's been stuck in that, let's call that mid 20s. It looks like this year will be closer to 30. Just wanted to get a sense of the opportunities to potentially accelerate that unit growth, especially in the US just given some of your competitors are planning to accelerate growth from here.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know it is a good when you look at. I talked before about managed cannibalization and when you do these infills, and you know 29 locations is a solid number for us as you start getting into infills; some of these projects take a little longer. You know, it's a little tougher. There's not a whole lot of green land out there for us to go in and open up a warehouse. So we have to do some creative things to find a way to infill in a very high market. International expansion continues to be strong. Some of the countries or regions that we do business in take quite a bit longer to get things done. So I think you'll see that ebb and flow. That number 25 to 29 or 25 to 30 is a good number for us.\nWe feel good with our staffing, leadership, and building out the infrastructure behind these warehouses. So we open with great solid support there.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nGreat. Then maybe just one follow-up question. In terms, you know, if you guys added Uber to a number of locations, so you know, if you guys think about the intermediate to longer term. Like, would you expect multiple providers at all Costco US stores over time? Maybe just more the rationale in terms of adding Uber and longer-term vision?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, we were testing Uber for some time in Texas. We had a test going on there, and we did see a new cohort of members engagement that are the Uber platform. Uber also allowed us to expand our international footprint too. So we're going to be out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, UK that will be expanding and where we don't have grocery delivery now. So there were some real benefits to that relationship along with the long-standing Instacart relationship that we had has been very good for many years. So we think that it does open up a window for us for some new member engagement, and we also think that it's going to be very good for us internationally and expansion there as well.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P.

    "content2": "Hi, good afternoon. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you speak to some of the innovation you're seeing in Non-Foods and anything else you think is driving some of the performance, particularly in discretionary categories? You know, you called out toys, sporting goods, and homes, so maybe any incremental color you can provide on those in particular. And while you're clearly gaining share when you compare your own performance to some of the syndicated data out there, does the emerging newness suggests there's also somewhat of a rising tide in some of these categories that saw some pull forward over the pandemic? Thanks.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, yeah, I think, you know, if you look at, if you talk about the home category, and definitely furnishings, which is one that was quite soft post-pandemic, that has come back strong in furniture, those type of things. In home decor, it's been some very unique items. I mean, we've got seven-foot artificial trees that have come in and just exploded out and just blowing out of the warehouses, and those are going at a nice clip. Domestics, most unique items, Swedish dish towels. Import items we're finding from around the world are doing very well. But it really comes down to unique items at great values that are exciting the members in all those categories. The houseware categories have been great.\nSporting goods and toys. Inflatable outdoor toys have been a big, big category for us as well. You know, we've added the Kirkland Signature Driver into our golf lineup that sells out as quick as it goes online. So we're seeing wins in several different categories.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. And just broadly, are you seeing the competitive environment heat up in terms of peers investing in price, particularly in Non-Foods? You have some peers talking more and more about looking to drive units. Others are talking about a big step up in appliance promotions recently. So any color on what you're seeing competitively.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, there will be ebbs and flows with the competition, but I'm very confident that we are always in the right position and we're staying ahead of that to keep the value there for our members. So those things are cyclical, but we're going to be a value every day.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think maybe just one thing to mention on that, Ron too. You mentioned it earlier, but with the, on the appliances, obviously making sure we're always very competitive on price. But I do think the acquisition of Innovel, Costco Logistics now, and the value that we offer members there through both, including the delivery, the installation, and the removal of the old appliances, is proving to be a real differentiator for us on the member experience as well.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nChristian Carlino\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, R5 Capital\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my questions, and Gary, welcome. It's nice to be talking to you at Costco. And Ron, thanks for coming on.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI appreciate it.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, R5 Capital\n\nSo. My first question is kind of the opposite, what everyone asks all the time around the fee. But given some of the stuff you've outlined around media and maybe driving the SG&A down, you know, why do you need to increase the fee? Your sales are strong, your fee income growth is strong. So what? Just because you've always done it doesn't mean you should do it. So, you know, what would be the rationale behind driving a fee increase at this point?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, fee increases go back to the members in lower prices. I mean, that's that it creates. I mean, that's one of the key parts that we use that money for is that it allows us to broaden that distance from the competition and bring greater values in improving our operation overall for the member. So that's the primary focus.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, R5 Capital\n\nOkay. Then my next question actually is kind of dovetails on the last one. But you know, you guys talked about the consumer being a little bit better overall. I guess what I was wondering; Is that really a Costco phenomenon? In other words, are you gaining share? That's what's really driving your improvements in some of these categories, like electronics, appliances, and big ticket, rather than the consumer actually getting better? Is there any way to tease that out?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI would say that that's very fair. Our merchants report monthly on industry trends in the country or internationally as we're seeing, and we can see our sales performance compared to the rest of market. I would think that you're spot on when you say that we're gaining market share.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nScott, maybe one thing I would just add, too, is I think, you know, we're all reading a lot about the consumer, of course, and what they're going through right now. And I think what we see is that value and quality has never been more important. And so that plays to, as Ron described earlier, what we deliver. And we're making sure that the teams are laser focused on every day delivering that value and quality. And so I think we're drawing customers to what Costco's offered for many years, and it's never more relevant than now based on what we're hearing from members and consumers.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, R5 Capital\n\nYeah, we definitely like our Costco here. At the Mushkin residence. So thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask you about maybe, you know, membership fee increase, but in a different way. You just touched upon it, you know, a little bit about, you know, membership fee increase. Right. Just gets reinvested to your members. Can you talk a little bit more about, you know, how you think about, you know, the areas of reinvestment? I'm sure you probably have already done a lot of work around, like, where you would like that to go. Is there anything that's unique about where reinvestment might come to this time around? Just thoughts around that?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know. It moves as time moves and you see pricing in categories and where we have the greatest opportunity to be more competitive for our members, and it may be in an area that Fresh Foods is seeing some price inflation. We may invest more in the Fresh Foods departments for that, that period of time, you know. The nice part about our model with 3600, 3700 SKUs is we're still quite nimble, as big as we are.\nSo we can shift and, you know, based on the needs of our members and where we think the best investment in margin would take care of them, we're able to shift that thought process and move it around. So I wouldn't say that there's any set. Okay. If membership fee goes up, it's going to be spent in these areas. We work as a team, and we continue to monitor it throughout the year and we act as needed.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nOkay. Just a quick follow up on club throughput. You know, it's remarkable how, you know. You drive up to a Costco club and it's hard to find a place to park, but yet you guys can still comp the way that you do. How are you thinking about throughput ways to improve that? And I don't know if both, you know, buy online and pickup is part of that. How do you think about things like Scan & Go or maybe it's club density? Just curious as to how you solve for that over time.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, a good part of those is, are things like our e-commerce business, and you know, how we can move out some of those goods out of the warehouse and move that business online. As Gary spoke to, now that we have control over Costco Logistics, we can bring great value to that experience as well. We continue to look at technology. You know, we're testing some front door scanners that are going to, they're speeding up our registers significantly. When we get all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door, it has shown a significant improvement in our register speed, and so that in turn turns over parking spaces much quicker.\nSo those kind of things along with, you know, strategic infills to help open up parking opportunities and gas expansions where those are needed as well. So, there are several different levers that we'll continue to pull on how we can best serve the member in that building, and where we need to make sure that we can look at throughput.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you guys. You're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi, Ron and Gary. You've done some really creative merchandising around UPTs and units per transaction with pickup items and innovation on that treasure hunt. What are your thoughts there? Also, a big ticket in electronics previously; previously it was a bit of a drag. Just would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And third part is Marketplace, the marketplace model, the concession model, and alternative inventory models. What are your views of opportunities there because they're really big ones and your member is so loyal to you as well. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOn your UPT, you were asking about the transaction impact?\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThinking strategically about adding units to people's baskets going forward and merchandising in that way as well. If it's something you see in terms of an opportunity.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. That's one of the big we were just in a session with our grocery divisions and talking there, and we've seen a great success in international foods that have been brought in to the US and of the like from the US into the other regions of the world where we do business. But you want to take care of not only the consumables in the grocery side, but when we bring in an item that's a success in Taiwan, Korea, or the UK and it creates that excitement for the member, that's when we really have done a good job of triggering that impulsive purchase where members are trusting the buyers and they will add that additional item to their cart. So that's been a big win for us. And again, it goes a lot of times with that treasure hunt.\nI mean, you know, you've heard the phrase people come in to spend $100 and walk out with $300. That's because our buyers do and our operators do a great job in making the warehouses exciting and keeping those on the forefront of what they're when they come in to do their basic shopping. They pick up a few additional items that just compel them at the time.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think maybe just to add on that, Ron too. I mean, the nice thing about the opportunity there for us is with trips up by 5%. That's really why the average basket size has been more flat recently. And that's because we've been growing member engagement in consumables, as Ron mentioned, with food and Fresh. And so it does present a great opportunity. And I think it also speaks to the team doing a good job of driving more frequency of member visits. So it creates a great opportunity for us to drive more of that basket size as well.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThen your question on Marketplace is a significant opportunity for us moving forward. I mean, we really do indeed see that. I think especially with our limited SKU count in the warehouse. How can we expand the offering to our members, bring value to their membership card beyond what's within our four walls or what's on Costco.com, and we see this as a great growth driver for us in the future. And a way to bring expanded value to the members as we look forward. So I'm quite bullish on Costco Next and what that can become in the future.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think the difference for us on that would be, of course, as we are with Costco Next, is just being very curated for the members. So we're unlike a traditional marketplace that is about maybe just sheer volume for others. It's about making sure the members getting something that truly is unique, valuable, and being consistent to who we are. But there's tremendous upside opportunity there in that regard.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. And finally, on that big ticket question, would love any green shoots on electronics or TVs. And the last question on Asia: you have same day in China, and you've done a lot of great things in the Asian region. Just would love any update there in terms of progress you made and the big opportunity for more infill as well. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, I think just briefly on electronics. So we believe, I think Ron referenced earlier, we look at a lot of the market data and we believe that we're winning with the member there in terms of the value that we're delivering, and when we look at our trends versus the market. So we feel good about our ability to continue to outpace the market there. And we're seeing a good opportunity within digital in particular to really drive more. More connection with the member and take some of those big ticket items from the warehouse to online as well.\nIn Asia, I think it would be consistent with what we've talked about with warehouses in the past, that we think all of the markets offer us great opportunity for growth. Some of those markets in Asia are more mature, but there's still significant opportunities to open new warehouses and fill in those markets. And then obviously we have markets like China where we're really just sort of starting that journey. But there's tremendous growth opportunity as we identify the right path forward in that market.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThe grocery delivery in China, we're up and going in six buildings. We just opened our seventh warehouse this week that will start up this weekend. It's been a big win for our members. You know, it's delivery within two hours is what is able to be done. And so we're seeing some good incremental shops initially out of that program. And we look forward to good things in the future on that.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Best regards.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group LLC\n\nGreat. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, a lot have been asked, but I did want to ask; with Costco Logistics, what was driving that 28% increase, which is very strong? Was it, you know, new relationships with some of the other retailers or partnerships or just anything you could share on that would be helpful?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, that is other. That is only. We only deliver Costco members' orders through Costco Logistics. There are no partnerships going through those numbers that you see. We do a trace amount of Sears numbers, but that's not in any of the numbers that we report the growth in. That is just part of the past relationship that's there as well. And it is. Appliances, furnishings, and outdoor were the three big drivers. Appliances were, you know, almost 30% growth for us in the period. And again, to Gary's point, it's that member value of, you know, the all in. What you see is what you pay price for delivery, installation, haul away, everything you need done at one time. That has really resonated with our members and has been a great driver of sales for us.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nJoe, I'll give you the practical example. As a new entrant to the Seattle market, I just had Costco Logistics deliver two mattresses, three TVs, and a couple of chairs as well for me. So that's the kind of stuff I think that we're seeing really resonate with members.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group LLC\n\nGot it. That's great. That's great. Thanks, guys. And then just one other question. I know it's still relatively small, I think, but the Costco Next is that sort of it seems like it's ramping nicely. I guess how will that continue to ramp in the future? Like, where do you see that going? And how important is that a driver? Like, is that sort of the basis for this marketplace that Oliver was just asking about?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, as Gary mentioned earlier, Costco Next is a bit unique, but it is a fully curated marketplace, as there's many other marketplaces out there that are just for somebody to go on and sell goods on this marketplace. These are relationships that our buyers have with our suppliers, and we're creating new suppliers as well. This has not only been a new way to sell goods. We've also found that we can find some really neat items that are selling through Costco Next that we in turn then bring into our warehouse. So it is a great testing ground for new items, a way to expand categories of accessories for certain categories that, you know,\nyou have swing sets that we sell online, but you have additional swings, slides, and other activities that you sell that we normally wouldn't be able to fit into a warehouse. So it really complements the core warehouse business, but gives us an opportunity to expand member value to these other partners as well. So we see a lot of upside there.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group LLC\n\nGot it. That's great. Thanks, guys. Good luck with the Q4.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nEVP and CFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions in our queue, and with that, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\nWe have no further questions in our queue, and with that, this does conclude today."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Costco Wholesale Corporation Fiscal 2Q 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press the star one. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Denise, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIn today's press release, we reported operating results for the Q2 of fiscal 2024. The 12 weeks ended 18 February 2024, as well as February retail sales for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, 3 March 2024. Reported net income for the 12 weeks Q2 came in at $1.743 billion, or $3.92 per diluted share, up from $1.466 billion, or $3.30 per diluted share in the 12 weeks Q2 last year.\nThis year's results included a tax benefit of $94 million per $0.21 per diluted share due to the deductibility of the $15 per share special dividend to the extent received by our employee 401(k) plan participants. Net sales for the Q2 were $57.33 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $54.24 billion in the Q2 last year.\nNet sales were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% in the US and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53-Week 2023 Fiscal Year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail dollars. For the US, we reported a 4.3% comparable, excluding gas deflation and FX.\nThe 4.3% would have been a 4.8%. Canada reported comp for the quarter, 9.2%, 9.0% ex-gas and FX. Other international, 8.6% and 8.2% ex-gas and FX. Total company of 5.6% reported for the quarter and a 5.8% excluding gas deflation and FX. E-commerce was an 18.4% reported and an 18.2% excluding FX. In terms of Q2 comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased by 5.3% worldwide and 4.3% in the US.\nOur average transaction or ticket was up 0.3% worldwide and up 0.2% in the US. Foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impact sales by approximately 0.2%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately -0.4%. Moving down the income statement to Membership fee income, we reported Membership fee income of $1,111 million, up $84 million or up 8.2% year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates at Q2 end, our US and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.9%, which is up 0.1% from Q1 and 12 weeks earlier. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, similar to the last quarter. Membership growth continues.\nWe ended the Q2 with 73.4 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 132.0 million cardholders, up 7.3%, with continuing growth throughout the quarters. At Q2 end, we had 33.9 million paid executive members, an increase of 646,000 during the 12-week Q2. Executive members represent a little over 46% of paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales.\nMoving down the income statement line next to the gross margin, our reported gross margin in the Q2 was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.80% compared to 10.72% last year in the quarter, and up 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. Writing down the little matrix that we usually do with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation.\nFirst line item is core merchandise, +5 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and +2 basis points ex-deflation, gas deflation, ancillary and other, +7 basis points and +6 basis points, 2% reward, -7 basis point and -7 basis point, LIFO, +3 basis point and +3 basis point, and all told total reported, again, gross margin year-over-year up 8 basis points and up 4 basis point excluding gas deflation.\nIn terms of the core margin on their own sales, again, while the number I just read you was a +5 basis points and +2 basis point ex-deflation, in terms of core margin on their own sales, our core and core margins were up 25 basis points year-over-year, with Food and Sundries, and Non-Foods being positive year-over-year and Fresh being negative. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin were higher by 7 basis points and higher by 6 basis point ex-gas.\nThe increase year-over-year was driven largely by E-com and partially offset by gas. The 2% reward, again, lower by 7 basis points both with and without gas deflation, with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, +3 basis points. We had a $14 million LIFO credit in the Q2 this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in the Q2 of last year. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A in the Q2 was higher year-over-year by 3 basis points, or a -3 basis point would be higher, coming in this year at 9.14% compared to last year's 9.11%. The higher 0.3% would have been lower by 1 basis point, excluding gas deflation.\nIn terms of Q2 year-over-year, the operations component of SG&A, doing the matrix, was 11 basis points higher, or -11, ex-gas deflation -8, so 8 basis points higher. Central, +4 and +5 basis points. Stock compensation, +4 and +4 basis point. Total would be 3 basis points higher year-over-year and +1 basis point or 1 basis point lower year-over-year or better.\nWith regard to the operations component being higher by 11 reported and eight excluding deflation basis point, as compared to a year ago, during the past year, we included two last March's extra top-of-scale increase in wages, which was about a 2 basis point hit to the SG&A line. As well, in the Q1 of this year, we raised the starting wage in the US and Canada.\nWe estimate the impact of that new wage also was roughly 2 basis points. So about 4 basis points of that 8 or 4 basis points of that 11 basis points were related to those two wage increases, more than normal. Below the operating income line, SG&A, I mentioned, was better by 4 and 5 basis points, and the rest was pretty much straightforward. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $34 million last year.\nInterest income and other for the quarter was higher by $102 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances, as well as FX, which was favorable versus last year. We'll see less benefit from interest income going forward following the January payment of the $6.7 billion special dividend.\nIn terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the Q2 came in at 22.1% compared to 26.1% in Q2 last year. As discussed earlier, this year's rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend paid to 401(k) participants. The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate, including discrete items, is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27 range. Excluding the special dividend tax benefiting Q2, our Q2 tax rate, instead of coming in at 22.1%, would have been 26.3%.\nOverall, reported net income was up 18.9% in the quarter on a reported basis. Again, excluding the special dividend-related income tax benefit, it would have been up 12.5% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of openings in the Q2, we opened four net new warehouses, including three new locations in the US.\nActually, two of them were Costco business centers and one new Costco wholesale warehouse, and one unit, our sixth in China, in mid-January in Shenzhen. That's our sixth in China. There's been a lot of press about it. We have an estimated 10,000 people we're opening, and there are just under 200,000 members currently, including more than 20,000 members signed up from Hong Kong.\nWe've seen all kinds of things over there, from tour agencies doing bus trips over to shop. For the full year 2024, we estimate 30 total openings, including two relocs, so for a net increase of 28 new units. That puts the remainder of fiscal 2024 for Q3 and Q4. We plan on opening a total of 15 net new locations, 11 in the US, two in Japan, and one each in Korea and China.\nRegarding CapEx, fiscal Q2 spend was approximately $1.03 billion, and for the year, it remains in the north of $4.4 to 4.6 million in that range. One additional comment on China. This past Monday, we launched in our Pudong, China location the ability for our members to order online about 400 items of our items to be delivered that day. And the delivery would be within about an 8km radius of the warehouse itself. It's getting a lot of social media attention over there, and we plan to launch it in the other four Shanghai area locations by month end, as well as in Shenzhen sometime the following month.\nIn terms of E-commerce, E-commerce sales in Q2 ex-FX increased 18.2%. E-com showed strength in several areas, led by sales of gold and very recently silver, as well as Appliances, which were very, very strong, as was gift cards and e-tickets.\nAs well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. Many of those items are sold via E-commerce. In Q2 of 2024, we completed over a million deliveries, up 28% versus Q2 a year ago. In terms of E-commerce sales over the past few months, we believe we've done a much better job explaining to our members the significant value propositions we offer compared to traditional competitors in several big-ticket categories. Under the \"Why Buy at Costco\" banner and the \"Price You See is the Price You Pay\" banner, we share with our members what's included in the price of Appliances, tires, televisions, computers, and mattresses.\nYou can see these online on our website of \"Why Buy at Costco.\" Just to give you one example, if you take a full set of high-end tires compared to a traditional retailer, we include, of course, installation, rotation, balancing, a five-year road hazard warranty.\nTypically, that's a lot less road hazard warranty than other places, or you'd have to pay for it extra. Ongoing flat repairs, nitrogen, and disposal of the prior tires. Just an example is where the price of the tires itself might be very close to us. When you put in all the differences of those additional items, it's anywhere from a 15% to 25 savings on any of these items. Next on my list, talk about costconext.com. A couple of comments on the seller platform.\nCostconext.com allows our members exclusive access to direct-to-consumer sites for top-quality brands at Costco value pricing. Currently, there are 70 Costco Next brand sites with 15 additional sites in development. We will likely end this calendar year with about 90 sites and continue to grow from there.\nCostco Next offers everything from home improvement to apparel to pet to home to kitchen to electronics to accessories as well as sports, bicycles, and toys. You should check it out. It's a pretty good site. Progress continues to be made in our E-com, mobile, and digital efforts. A couple of recent enhancements. In February, we rolled out our new native Mobile Application Homepage on iOS. The native Homepage now loads in less than 2 seconds compared to 8 seconds previously.\nNeedless to say, that's important when about 60% of our E-com business, both visitors and orders, are now done via our Mobile App and Browser. Last week, we rolled out Apple Pay to all members online, both web and mobile, on 28 February. App downloads during the quarter were up 2.8 million and currently total around 33 million.\nOn the product side, a couple of other new items to comment on. In our Food Courts, we recently replaced the Churro with an Awesome, freshly baked 5.5-Ounce Chocolate Chip Cookie for $2.49. It is awesome. It's a great tasting and a great tasting turkey sandwich for $6.99, with the rollout of the latter being completed this week. In addition, we recently opened our first fully operated Sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future.\nThis operation is what we have successfully done for many years and throughout our Asia Costcos in several countries over there. The Sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future. A couple of comments about inflation.\nIn the last quarter, in the Q1, we estimated that year-over-year inflation was approximately 0% to 1. We'll now say that in Q2 it was essentially flat. Notwithstanding essentially flat, we're taking price reductions where we can. Anecdotally, everything from simple items like reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99, the 48-count of Kirkland Signature atteries from $17.99 to $15.99, a 24-count of Pellegrino from $16.99 to $14.99, and even four pounds of frozen Three-Berry Fruit Blend from $14.99 down to $10.99 with new drop pricing. We continue to do that. We always want to be the first out there trying to lower prices.\nMany new items, and sporting goods and lawn and garden are being set with lower prices year-over-year. Overall, mostly due to reduced freight costs and lower commodity costs versus a year ago.\nOverall, our inventories and SKUs are in good shape across all channels. Overall, we've had good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. In terms of shipping and supply chain issues, we've been asked about that often of late. There are some delays, generally just a couple to three weeks, but mostly now planned for. First, there was an issue a while back with the Panama Canal challenges. Then, of course, the Red Sea challenges. A lot of that has to do with changing the way ships are being routed.\nNo meaningful pricing issues because of a lot of in-place contracts. Finally, turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, 3 March 2024, compared to the same retail calendar weeks last year.\nAs reported in our release, that sales for the month came in at $18.21 billion, an increase of 6.9% versus $17.04 billion for the same four retail weeks last year. Again, just to announce what we did in the announcement earlier today, the US reported comp of 3.4% for February, ex-gas and FX 4.1%, Canada 8.4% and 8.3%, other international 10.8% and 11.3%, for a total company of 5.0% reported and a 5.6% ex-gas and FX, with E-com coming in at a 16.2% reported and a 16.0% ex-FX.\nOur comp traffic or frequency for February was up 6.2% worldwide and up 5.0% in the US. Foreign currency year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada by about -0.1%, other international by approximately a half a percent, and total company by approximately 0.1%.\nGasoline price deflation negatively impacted total reported comp sales by approximately 0.5%. The average worldwide selling price per gallon of gas was down approximately 3.5% versus last year. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down about 1.1%, which includes the negative impacts from FX and gas deflation. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights are as follows. US regions with the strongest comps were Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast.\nIn terms of other international and local currencies, we saw strength in Mexico, Australia, and Korea. Moving to merchandise highlights, Food and Sundries were positive in the mid-single digits. Fresh Foods were up high single digits, and Non-Foods were positive mid-single digits. Ancillary businesses were up in the low single digits. Food Court, Pharmacy, and Optical were top performers with gas down low single digits on a lower price per gallon.\nIn terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 7 April, on the following Wednesday, 10 April, after market close. Lastly, before I turn it back to Demi for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to many of you who have tuned in to each quarter, some for many years, to allow me to share with you Costco's results, both our ups and our downs, and thankfully many more ups than downs, and provide some fun and informative color on how we're doing along the way.\nSince going public in December 1985, I have hosted all but one call, and it has been an absolute privilege and honor to do so. So thank you all.\nAs you know, in early February, it was announced that I will be ceding the role of CFO to Gary Millerchip, effective 15 March, after our Q2 10-Q is filed, and retire, including from our Board, next January. It's a bit surreal of late, but what a wonderful journey it has been with such a great Company and great people, including many of you on the call today. I have certainly been very fortunate.\nThe good news, Gary joined Costco last week, and along with David and Josh, we'll continue to provide to you all the transparency and straightforwardness that we are known for. It will be a positive and seamless transition. With that, I will be happy to turn it back to Demi to open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. The floor is now open for your questions. To ask a question this time, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, everyone. Hey, Richard. Best wishes to you. Thank you for all your guidance. That's a metaphor since you don't give guidance. My first question is on this; this is like a parting question on Membership, and I want to make sure this framework sounds right. I know you said it's if, not when. Part of the thought process is there are enough levers in the business, product savings, cost savings to be able to drive an appropriate level of profit growth from the business.\nWhen that no longer presents itself, that's when the Membership price increase could come through. That could come through earlier than that, but that was one framework we were thinking in this, as we wait to hear when it happens.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. And by the way, it's when, not if, still. But really, joking aside, we're not that smart in terms of figuring out exactly why. I mean, we know that all the factors that we believe would, if we wanted to do it, would we feel comfortable in terms of renewal rates, new member signups, and loyalty? All those things are continuing in the right direction.\nIt really is a function, and I don't think it would be done simply because, \"Hey, things have slowed down a little bit. Let's do it now.\" We like the fact that we're performing well. We like the fact that most all metrics are going in the right direction in our business right now. We've got plenty of runway left. And given the economy and given everything else, it's us. It's Costco.\nSo I think it is simply still not trying to be cute about it. It's not some big analytical formula. It's simply a measure of we will, at some point, I'm sure, do it. And I've been joking with Gary. It'll be on his watch, not mine.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd then maybe one more, Richard, is another question. You used to say the business has comped very consistently over time, and used to say, \"I bet when it won't comp north of four to five because that's where it may be tougher to leverage our expenses.\" If you think about that framework, does it still apply? And then, as you hand the baton to Gary and even Ron, do you spend more, or are there ways where the cost structure of the business can actually be altered to lower that leverage threshold point?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nRight. Well, I would say it's probably more likely to go up a little than down, just because of whatever goes on in life with inflation that happened. But I got to look back at the last few years. We and others were helped through the crisis of COVID, and we haven't given a lot of that back. If I look at our SG&A, I remember when in fiscal 2019 tp 2018, it came in at a 10.04%. I'm looking at these numbers here.\nAnd even in 2020, it was at a 10.30% in the Q1 before COVID. And then in fiscal 2021, it was a 9.65% and then down to an 8.88%, and now it's up to fiscal 2023, it was a 9.08%.\nNotwithstanding that, I remember when it was slightly above 10%, we said, \"Well, it's never going to get below 10% again.\" And a lot of factors continue to change. But just the sheer high productivity that we have is, frankly, higher than we thought. Some of that was gained through COVID because of everything else going on. But we haven't given it back. The good news is we haven't given it back. And the good news continues to be that we seem to continue to be able to take market share.\nI think the fact that on big ticket items, there's less SG&A. We continue to change the pack sizes of things for less freight, whatever it is. Although freight would be SG&A. But it is still a lot about sales at the end.\nIf you ask the rhetorical question, \"If comps went to zero, what would that mean?\" That would be tough on SG&A, but we'd figure other things out.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep. Okay. Best wishes. Thanks, Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey. Good afternoon, Richard. Congrats on a great career for someone who started on basically day one at the company. My question is on culture. You've always said it was customers first, employees second, shareholders third, and that philosophy has clearly played out. So looking ahead, I'm curious how the new team is going to keep this culture intact and resist pressure from some of the non-founders of the company going forward.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, first of all, nothing has changed. It's not unlike the same question I think that was asked of Jim Sinegal after 28 years before he retired and before we knew who his successor was going to exactly be. And I remember the board asking, \"If you're 100 in terms of extreme value and extreme taking care of the customer, and the employee, and everybody else, whoever takes your place, what will they be?\" And he paused for a minute and said, \"I have no doubt they'll be at least in the mid-90s, if not higher.\"\nAnd frankly, after Craig was made that, in my view, whatever that number was, it increased towards 100 just because that's what we do. That culture is so ingrained here. And we talk about changing management.\nI always joke when people ask me as CFO how I'm important, am I important to the strategic whatever of the company. The fact is we're run by merchants and operators, and we're there to serve and help them and certainly add our voice. But the fact of the matter is, with Craig for 12 years and now with Ron, you have people that have been here for 35 to 40 years and were born and raised and have grown up in this culture.\nIt is so intact. Just last week when Gary joined us, he had to go through the required two-hour Costco orientation, which includes the obey the law, the take care of your customer, the take care of your employee, the respect your supplier, and then if you do that, you can reward the shareholder. That's the one thing I can sleep very well at night.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Richard. Enjoy your retirement.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Best of luck, Richard. You mentioned previously that most of the metrics are moving in the right direction. Can you highlight which metrics are not moving in the right direction? And especially from a Membership per club standpoint, are there any signs that some of the more mature locations are either reaching a saturation or starting to see a peak in that metric?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nNo. First of all, when I said most, I was just trying to be human, that nobody's perfect. Everything is working in the right direction right now. And actually, I wasn't talking just about Membership metrics, but in general, knock on wood, things are working pretty well. When we sit in at our monthly budget meeting, more times than not, we get pretty excited about what's going on from a new merchandising standpoint, newness, buying with conviction, and being aggressive and assertive out there.\nI mean, what we saw with just even that simple example I gave you with changes to big ticket items, and \"why buy them at Costco,\" we saw great changes in numbers. So we know that we've got a lot of levers to be able to pull to make this thing work. And so no, I just said honestly, I said most because nobody's perfect.\nI didn't have any particular examples.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nUnderstood. My follow-up question is on what seems like an inflection in the discretionary business. To what degree is Costco experiencing improvement in the Gen Merch categories as a result of aggressive changes, either like you cited with the way you're communicating with the customer or the member or aggressive actions to take down prices? And if you are pulling those levers hard, is there an opportunity to move even more aggressively to drive the discretionary business? It does seem like Costco's experiencing a rebound in some of these areas more so than the rest of retail. Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. And no, and absolutely. What is it? It used to be MBDA. It's Circana, which is that industry that shows you how you are on different Non-Food product categories versus the industry. When we look at something like Appliances in the last several weeks or a couple of months, the industry is flat, and we're up north of 20%. Same thing with tires, more than that percent.\nAnd so now you can't say, \"Let's do everything, and everything will be up 20% or 30,\" because that's not going to happen. But at the end of the day, the focus of the buyers, as an example, is coming up with new ways to do things to have great pricing and to constantly improve that pricing and figure out how to do that with our global buying power.\nEvery time there's a commodity price increase, given an item business, we have buyers that are in charge of 20 and 30 items, if not less, not 200 to 300 items in a category. They know a lot more, in our view, about every cost component of that. I feel very good that we do a very good job. I'm not suggesting others don't, but I know we do a very good job of getting on the phone immediately and working those issues. As soon as we can get a savings, we're out there first passing it on. That's just our religion. Now, we're able to do that partly because our sales have been relatively strong. We've lapsed some things from last year that have helped.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nRichard, thanks for taking the question. My congratulations as well. Well done. It's been a pleasure. Wondering if you can maybe talk about Kirkland, the penetration, what's going on there, any member shopping behavior around kind of private brand versus branded, and maybe what some of the branded packaged good companies are doing to maybe get some volumes up. Just curious about your view on that.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThere's not a lot of trade down, although when we sometimes have more control over certain private label CPG items, that we're able to drive more business. So we're seeing an increased penetration of that versus some of the brands sometimes. But then that gets the brands to the table to work to provide more value on the branded as well. We want to be both. But we haven't really seen that. That was a question that happened as, quote, \"The economy was the question of, are we going into a recession a couple of years ago?\" And inflation was peaking at 7% to 9. And are we seeing a difference?\nSo we did see, if you look back over the last 20 years, and without looking at the exact numbers, it seems like every year we grow 0.25% to 0.5% of increased Kirkland Signature penetration. And then there was one year when we were asked a couple of years ago, it seemed like there was 1.5% to even 2% change in penetration. So people were, in my view, switching a little bit out. But that's changed. We don't see that as much anymore.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGot it. And then just on Costco Logistics, I mean, you gave some delivery numbers there. Just maybe step back a little bit. The penetration of Costco Logistics within the business, how meaningful is that at this point? What's left in terms of maybe growing that? Is that just going to go with the big ticket trends, or are there, I don't know, internal initiatives to kind of drive further penetration of Costco Logistics?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWhat it's done strategically, and I hate to overuse that word, it's allowed us to be much better in value and delivery times and quality and brought the delivery costs down on big ticket items, particularly Appliances and big screen televisions, mattresses and furniture, indoor and outdoor patio and patio furniture and indoor furniture, some sporting goods. Before we bought Innovel, we're now called Costco Logistics in the spring of 2020.\nIn the year before that, in the US, we did about 2.2 million drops. And a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to delivering and installing a new refrigerator, freezer, or washer-dryer and taking the old one away for disposal. Both of those are a drop. Recognize there's an extreme difference there. But we did about 2.2 million drops in the US, none of which we did ourselves.\nWith the acquisition of Innovel, I think probably over the last with this million this quarter, a rough number of 4 million drops, which I believe about 70% of them are over 4 million drops, and about 70% of them is us. We've reduced the delivery times. We've just introduced in some categories like two-hour windows or three-hour windows where you can choose, two-hour windows where you can choose. So we're constantly getting better, and we've greatly improved the value.\nWhen you look at something a category like Appliances, we're still a very low percentage of the industry. And the fact that it was up +20% last month or last quarter is a function of some of the things we're doing in terms of shouting out how good of a deal it is and doing a better job of that.\nBut we think we have an opportunity to continue to grow those categories, recognizing they're all meaningful categories, but they're all small percentages of our total. That's one of the nice things about us, that we have lots of different categories.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGot it. Great. Well, thanks again, and best of luck, Richard.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nEvening. Thanks for taking my question. And Richard, I also want to offer my congratulations on your retirement. So just going back to the core on core margins, they're up, I think, 25 basis points this quarter. Just curious what drove that strong performance, if there's anything particular driving that.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, on the Non-Food side, the biggest thing is, well, not as big a piece of it is comparing to last year when we had extra markdowns. I think we probably talked about it last time that Non-Foods a year ago had been down year-over-year because of some of the supply chain challenges we had when things were coming in late after the season in case some of the big-ticket items from overseas containers.\nThat was probably a chunk of it. On the Fresh Food side, I said it was down year-over-year a little. Fresh is competitive, and we're being ever competitive on it as well. Again, I don't view any of that as being terribly meaningful in terms of, is that a big change that is coming?\nThere's always something that's up a little bit, and there's another thing that's down a little bit.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then maybe just one follow-up question. On the expense side, you guys did have better expense controls this quarter. Just curious what changed sequentially because the growth rate did decelerate by a few percentage points.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI can't think off the top of my head other than I actually, someone across the table just said the word focus. At our budget meetings, which happen every four weeks with 150+ people in town from all over the world, those are the kind of things we look at. I think the operators are doing a better job of budgeting. One of the things I think that came out at the last budget meeting in terms of budgeting, if you budget sales a little higher and they came in a percent lower, you got to control your labor costs.\nA lot of it has to do with focus and being meaningful to that. We certainly don't try to control expenses by not doing a wage increase when we think we need to. We certainly have done that.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Best of luck.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nAnalyst, R5 Capital\n\nHey, thanks. Hey, Richard, I feel like we should be raising your jersey to the Rafters like a superstar's retiring here. It's never been without you, to tell you the truth [crosstalk]. So congratulations.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nAnalyst, R5 Capital\n\nSo here you are. So yeah, we'll have to see the CFO Hall of Fame. A couple of things, some of your comments that you made, you're doing this delivery in one hour in China. I think you started going from one club to three. Is that something you envision that can expand outside of China? And how should we think about that, maybe even vis-à-vis the US?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, in a way, we're doing Same-Day here with a few people, most notably Instacart, and a little bit with shipped down in the Southeast. And I think we've got a test in Texas with Uber. But at the end of the day, we had that Same-Day delivery already as function. Over there, it is a third party that's doing it, like Instacart or these other ventures here. So it's new. It's not something that's new to the warehouse club industry in China.\nYou could look elsewhere and find it too, but it's certainly something that makes sense. And again, in part because of social media, there's been a lot of publicity in just, I mean, from the day it launched three days ago, it's gone nuts in terms of how many page hits it's getting and all that stuff. But it's just part of the business.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nAnalyst, R5 Capital\n\nGot it. And then we've talked about this over the years, and I think you said you're going to do 28 net new clubs this year. What's the capacity of the organization? Do you envision that going to 35 to 40? How should we think of it as we move out three to five years? Is it something that's going to trend up?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, who knows? But I think generally, it probably trends up a little. There was a few years there, excluding the year when COVID hit, that we only did like 13 because there were shutdowns in certain countries of construction as well as the US. But if you look back, excluding that year, over a three to five-year period, ± a couple of years there, it was about 23 a unit. Without looking at numbers, about 23 units a year.\nAt the time, you said, \"What do you see over the next 10 years?\" What we saw collectively was somewhere in the, hopefully, targeting, let's say, 25 for the next five years per year, and then going up to 25 to somewhere in the high 20s, and if not 30. I think that's generally the sense that we feel. Could we do more? Yes.\nAre we comfortable doing it this way? Yes. I think part of that is it's such a hands-on business. I get to say that from sitting here in headquarters most of the time, not traveling like my colleagues doing in operations. But Ron's a great example. I mean, he and several regional executives in operations, if there's an opening somewhere or not an opening, they're out visiting.\nUsually, at least two, if not three weeks a month, are out for three or four days jumping around, visiting locations, not only existing locations, but new sites. And so I think from a standpoint, and the other thing is, particularly in newer countries, you want to get the first one open so you can train 50 to 80 people that want to move to the next location in that city that'll help that one go.\nAnd we were very fortunate a few years back in the first Shanghai in Minhang in China, where we had a number of employees from Taiwan that wanted to move and be promoted into new jobs over there. So that helps us when we have one, then two, then four, then whatever. So we take it slow. All I know is we're all very busy, and particularly the operators and merchants as well. And so that's kind of the paradigm that I think that we're going to continue to work at, something in the 25 range and then heading up. Just a quarter ago, I think our budget for this year was 32, or 31; now it's 28. And that's simply timing.\nThere were two or three that pushed that for whatever construction delays or you found something in the soil delays or whatever it might be. It might have moved from mid to late summer to early fall, which is the new fiscal year. So I'm feeling pretty good that we're going to open 25+ for the next couple of years and then probably 28+ and go on from there.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nAnalyst, R5 Capital\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thanks, Richard. You mentioned the word surreal, the feeling retiring. I'd say it's almost as surreal as a $4.99 Chicken. So thank you for all the help over the years. I would say, I guess, two things I wanted to touch on. One is ticket pressure. It looks like just in the most recent sales, with traffic growing more and more, that you're seeing some AUR pressure. Is that 0% inflation turning to deflation as the merchants are seeing into March to April?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, I think that if there again, the inflation number is a calculation based on costs and mix. I think it's probably I wouldn't look too closely at if the average ticket was up a few tenths in the quarter and then it was down a percent in February by a tenth. That's still relatively close. Some of it's a mixed change, I'm sure. And some of it is some of the examples I gave you about lower pricing. Even if the underlying cost hasn't changed, some of it may be in terms of how we package, and we take advantage of that. And that's on the sales side and not the exact cost from yesterday.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nLooking ahead, that number flat looks pretty good from what the merchants are seeing today.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. I think when I go to the last budget meeting two weeks ago, I think there's in the presentations, there's a lot of. I used the phrase a few minutes ago, upscaling. I didn't use that phrase, but then buying with conviction. I mean, I think that the buyers are looking ahead right now in an offensive way, in a positive way. Hopefully, we'll be right. But we feel so far we're being right.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nI wanted to follow up with my second question on the Instacart side of E-commerce penetration. What would E-commerce penetration be now in the US if you included the Instacart delivery and the other deliveries?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Instacart's 1.5% to 2, something below 2%, but more than 1.5%, which is still on a $200 billion retailer. It's a lot. And we don't include that because the Instacart person comes in, buys it, and checks out at the front end. So we don't include that. So you'd add, depending on rounding, you'd add 1% to 2 to the top line number.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Well, thanks. Thanks for everything.\nThanks for everything.\nThanks for everything and enjoy retirement.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI hope to see you all.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood evening. Thanks, Richard, and have to add my congratulations to you. It's been a pleasure. Just wanted to ask where Costco stands with retail media and advertising dollars. I think the last update I had was in the range of a few hundred million. Or just curious if you're willing to share with us where that stands today, what kind of growth that is experiencing, and just the company's thought process on investing in that down the line.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, without giving numbers out, we know there's an opportunity there more than we've done in the past. In the last six or eight months, we brought on people that are seasoned in this business to help us. It's a point of focus. We know that there's money out there. We've always been very successful in other forms of vendor buckets, whether it's end caps or advertising in our own Costco Connection.\nOf course, over the last several years, some advertising online, or banners, or placement. There's a lot more that can be done there. Rest assured, whatever it is, we're going to use it to just like when we always said, \"If we can save a dollar on buying something, we're going to give $0.80 or $0.90 to the customer.\" I think that mantra will continue on this side as well.\nBut there's certainly ability for more dollars out there. Some of our big retail competitors have talked about doubling in five or six years what they have. I think, again, it's a lower market share for us, so there's a little more opportunity for us to continue to grow that.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you. And maybe just can I just follow up with the decision to roll out Apple Pay? Costco is pretty notorious for being strict on the payment method you could use. So just maybe the thought process on that, what you expect that to do for your E-commerce business, and any economics you can share?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. On E-com, there's not as many stored cards for our members. And as we're doing more with a digital wallet, that'll help as well. So it's something that should help.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi there. This is Katie on for Oliver. And of course, best wishes to you in your retirement. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the Kirkland price gap versus national brands. I know you touched on the Kirkland brand a little bit earlier on the call. But how has that price gap changed, especially year-over-year? And has there been any impact to unit elasticities given that price discrepancy? Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, we definitely have seen an impact from it. I mean, historically, the view was it has to be at least as good, if not better quality than the leading national brand, and at least a 20% savings as compared to what we sell the national brand for. Those metrics continue in that regard.\nI think what we've seen, when we look at some of the items that have risen greatly in price, like paper products, on a percentage basis over the last several years because of freight costs, because of pulp prices, because of energy, all those things have dramatically increased. What used to be a, I don't know the exact numbers, but for an 18-pack of a 24-pack of toilet tissue or a 15-pack to 18-pack of paper towels, you've got price points in the high 20s, if not low to mid-30s.\nWhere we can show a dramatic savings on that, we've seen dramatic changes in unit market share towards Costco, towards Kirkland Signature. That's something that's been an iterative process over many years. Probably goes up and down a little bit. I'd say it's gone up a little bit in terms of a little more of its penetration in the last couple of years.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the store discussion and unit growth, can you just provide a little bit of color on how the international store openings are performing just from a productivity angle? How is that versus the more tenured stores as well as the domestic stores?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI don't think there's a big difference. In new markets, it's always a little slower. So when we opened originally in Iceland, Sweden, Auckland, or some of those, or France several years ago, you're always going to start out, or frankly, Japan 20 years ago. You tend to start out lower. In some cases, it's also a question is some local vendors may not want to.\nLocal country vendors may not want to sell you because they want to upset all the big traditional that have all the market share before we enter. And once we get two or three open, they talk to you a little more. And so I think all those things help us as we grow. Certainly, it's changed a little bit in the last few years.\nChina being the most recent example, when we opened the first one in Minhang in Shanghai about four years ago, it made international news based on just the sheer number of members we signed up and everything. So we have a lot faster start, I think. Each year, we have a lot faster start than the year before. And so I don't see a big difference there.\nIf you look in the US, I mean, I think one thing that's interesting is this fiscal year, we're going to open whatever, 28 units. Let me get my page here. And I think of the 28, 20+ are in the US, which is some people have asked, \"Well, has it slowed down internationally?\" No, International takes a little longer to do. But what's interesting is we have a lot more runway than we ever thought possible.\nIf you had asked us five years ago, by now, how many would we be putting in this year in the US, we would not have said 20+. It's got to slow down at some point. But the volumes that we're now doing in these locations. We've got to bleed some of that off. And so that's one good point. And then we've still got plenty going on overseas. And you'll see that continue to ramp up as well.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thank you so much, and best wishes again.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nThanks for the time, guys. It seems like you guys are doing some things to cut down on Membership sharing, Food Court usage from non-members, etc. Richard, are you seeing something in the business that gives you concern that there's a growing issue from things like Membership sharing?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation",
    "content2": "No. I think part of it is, first of all, I think the storyline sometimes is a little greater than the reality. During COVID, we did a little bit more. There was a little bit more Membership sharing. You had individuals where one family member, maybe not the one that had one of the two Memberships, was coming into shop with mom or dad's credit card. We allowed it.\nThen with the advent of self-checkout over the last several years, when you walk in the front door and you just flash your card and do they look at it or not, who knows? You would, people would get in. And if you're going through self-checkout, you're not having to show your Membership card to the cashier. And so there's probably an increasing but still small level of abuse of that privilege.\nBut we also had complaints from members saying, \"I pay, why shouldn't they?\" So the view was we needed to just shore that up a little bit. And we did. We did it over a period of six months, I think about six months, where first there were warnings and then ultimately changed. Are we getting some new sign-ups from it? Absolutely. But it's relative to the 60 or 70 million members; it's not terribly meaningful. But it's more fair and the right thing to do.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nYeah. I mean, that was actually you started to answer it. So you've seen some acceleration of Membership. Should we kind of expect to see that in the future, like what we've seen with Netflix, for example, as they cut down on their sharing?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nRight. Well, it seems like Netflix had a much bigger issue or the ability to share was much easier because, first of all, it's electronic. In this sense, you still have to show a card when you walked in. And we're actually doing testing on that too in terms of having your card be scanned and reviewed when you walk in. And we've done that in the UK, I believe, for a few years.\nIt's all about just, I would say it's as much hygiene as anything else. And it'll be slightly profitable to the extent that we're making sure everybody, I think we signed up more members that were non-members than lost the small sales that that non-member did.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nMakes sense. Thanks again and enjoy the next stage.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nCongratulations, Richard. Enjoy your retirement. You'll be missed. So when you think about, you don't have many pain points in your clubs, but when you think about kind of throughput and things like, I know you tested BOPIS and cost really didn't make sense there. Things like that, indoor Scan-and-Go. Do you think there are some unlocks here to do more volume and/or reduce any pain points?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think the biggest challenge with pain points, first of all, is flow of merchandise and pallets through the system, which we continue to work on and improve. If you had asked us 10 years ago, will you ever have 150 of your 600 US locations doing over $300 million and 40 of them doing over $400 million? The answer would be no, no way, even with inflation. The fact is we're doing a lot more volume\nthan we've ever thought we would do. And so the biggest answer of not only making it a little more efficient but driving more sales is cannibalizing. We find existing members that sometimes will say, \"I don't want to go there.\nIt's too busy today.\" And by opening up that third or fourth unit in that city, we're seeing not an increase of by a third or a fourth of the Membership base, but a significant increase in sales. And I can't think of anything specifically. We're always doing things with, oh, David mentioned something here. One of the things we should be doing shortly is having warehouse inventory online. So when you go online to, now I say that, a couple of people in the room are smiling and say it may be a few months or a few more than a few months, but it'll be soon.\nBut at the end of the day, if you look at something to buy online and we have it in a location or two in the zip code where you typically shop, in the location you would shop physically, we'll let you know you can buy it there. And in many cases, it'll be cheaper if you go pick it up yourself because the online cost might be higher, is typically higher, particularly on the Non-Food items. So I think that's something that'll help that as well.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nSecondly, is there any way to tell, you think about email outreach? I mean, it seems to be getting better and more call to action. I think about the seven days of spring that you're in the middle of now. Is there a way to tell the productivity of that outreach? And is that driving some of the E-com pickup?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAbsolutely. And yes, there is a way to tell. We're looking at it. Again, without going into a lot of detail, a couple of years ago, we brought in a new person in charge from IT in terms of all digital. He's built a team. They're working closely with merchants and operators, but mostly with merchants in terms of doing these types of things. And we've seen, again, lots of improvements with our app, with our desktop. It's getting less clunky by the day and more ability to do some items to drive sales and some promotions like that.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood evening. We'll miss you, Richard. Welcome aboard, Gary. On the MFI, did you mention how much the FX impacted total MFI growth year-over-year? More broadly, it seems like it's becoming more competitive to acquire customers in the club channel. Couponing amongst your peers has really accelerated over the past year. Is that what you've observed? Do you think it's still escalating? How are you responding?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI got to tell you, in the last 12 months, we opened like 3% new locations, and we had a 7% increase in new members. We're not finding. We do a few promotional things, but I would say we have not increased the types of things we do at all. You're right. At other places, there's not a day that goes by you can't get a deep discount, much deeper than we've even ever done on an ongoing basis.\nNo, we're not doing anything different. I mean, are we pleasantly surprised by the rate of new sign-ups? Yes. It's nice to hear and have. I think the fact that things like social media has helped us with the value proposition. No, we're not doing a lot of things in that regard.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust from a technical question, one of your peers talks about tenured renewal rate. The 93% that you quote, does that include the year-one renewal or anyone that comes through the door on one of those digital coupons?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYes. It does. We've been doing it the same way forever.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thank you very much and best of luck.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you. Okay. Fine.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Robert Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, Richard. My congrats as well. You will be missed very much. Listen, just a quick question. I love the credit card rewards program. It's amazing. It's like the best thing that's ever happened to me, the Citi card you guys do. Is there any issue or change with the late fees or anything going on that could change the rewards program or anything there?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, that's the new recent headline of that happening, and we'll have to wait and see. Look, at the end of the day, it may change the economics. There are other levers that we've talked to them in the past, our issuing bank, about what we could do, but nothing is done at this point.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thanks again, and congrats on your retirement.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you. Two more.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nAnalyst, Loop Capital\n\nThanks for taking my question, and I wish you a long and happy retirement, Richard. I'm going to go out on a nitpick on the renewal rate. If renewal rate's flat overall but 10 bps better US and Canada, that seems to imply it's not as good in international markets. Is that just some of the sampling that went on in China, or what do you think might be driving that?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, that's exactly what it is. First of all, if you just take the total number of members divided by total number of warehouses, I think we're about close to 70,000 households per location. When we open a unit in not only China but other countries in Asia, we'll have anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 members at sign-up, many of whom are lookie-loos, and a year later don't renew.\nWe will start in some new countries with once the first batch renew for the first time, you might have a renewal rate in the 50s or at best low 60s. Then it just, over the next four or five years, it continues to grow to something that's higher than that. That's higher than that. That's more extreme than we saw 30 years ago in the US and Canada. But nonetheless, that's exactly what you see.\nSo when you just opening the one unit in Shenzhen or whatever we opened a year and a half ago in China, that's going to affect the international renewal rate. When we look at all other countries, when we look at the 11 other operations outside of US and Canada, their renewal rate generally ticks up a little bit every year, like the US and Canada. US and Canada, by the way, has been helped also with increased penetration of executive members.\nWe have that in several countries, but not all countries. The smallest countries, we don't have it in a number of units. And also with auto renewal, which has helped us in the last several years. And I don't believe everywhere.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nAnalyst, Loop Capital\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Once those clubs mature, the clubs in China, other new clubs in Asian markets, etc., do they tend to, can you serve a higher number of households there? Meaning, would you expect them to be sustainably above that 70 or so households that you have in an average club?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, the answer is it is. It does. So the answer is yes. Yeah. I was two months after it opened in Osaka, Japan, back in October. And on a Sunday, a random Sunday. I was not there on business, but a random Sunday went over there. You couldn't move in the place. And it was great. It was a wonderful picture to see. So yes, I think that despite the fact that not everybody has cars and despite the fact that people have smaller housing arrangements, value plays well.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nAnalyst, Loop Capital\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats, Richard, on your retirement. As it relates to big-ticket discretionary items, it seems like that category's improved a little bit. Just wanted to get a little bit of understanding as to what you've seen that's underlying that improvement in trend. And then secondarily, on AI, just curious with the recent technology enhancements that the business has made, how you see that impacting the business on a go-forward basis.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Well, in terms of big-ticket discretionary, I think we completely believe that it's some of the things we're doing on our side to better explain the value. I mean, it was almost like you did that, and sales skyrocketed. A 20% to 30 increases in some of those big-ticket categories just over the last couple of months, even if a piece of it is a year-over-year comparison, which I don't even know if it is or it isn't.\nAt the end of the day, it was very evident to us. And the other comment I mentioned, particularly on Appliances, we're still a very, very small percentage of the total industry. And so it's easier to take market share when you're such a small percent of something. So I think that'll continue. As regards to AI, we're just in the early innings of that.\nWe've had third-party AI companies, large companies, including ones that are headquartered in Seattle, come out and talk to us. There's a whole list of things that we're doing, working with IT and our CEO and our heads of operations and merchandising to see where and how it might fit. But that'll be a question for Gary in the future.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you very much and best of luck.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, everyone. Again, it's been fun. The thing I'll miss most about the job is talking to everybody because I like talking. And it's been a great story to tell, but it's been an absolute privilege. And I appreciate it. So have a good day. And I'm sure we'll be speaking to some of you shortly over the next few days with additional questions. Have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much, man. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Today's call is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your telephone keypad to queue your question. It is star one again. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.\nThe risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nComparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's release, we reported operating results for the Q1 of fiscal 2024, the 12 weeks ended 26 November 2024. Reported net income for the 12-week Q1 came in at $1.589 billion or $3.58 per share, up from $1.364 billion or $3.07 per share in the 12-week Q1 last year.\nThis year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 a share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per share related to stock-based compensation and also included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities.\nNet sales for the Q1 were $56.72 billion, a 6.1% increase over last year's Q1 $53.44 billion. Net sales were benefited by approximately 1/2% to 1 in the US and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. In the US, reported 2% comp sales ex-gas deflation, FX 2.6%.\nCanada reported 6.4%, ex-gas and FX 8.2%. Other International reported 11.2%, ex-gas and FX 7.1%. For Total Company, reported 3.8% and 3.9% excluding those two items. E-commerce which was reported as 6.3%, came in at 6.1% excluding FX.\nOverall for the first fiscal quarter, fresh foods were relatively strong once again with food and sundries right behind. Non-foods showed improvement over the September, October, and November timeframe, as did e-comm sales. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the United States.\nOur average transaction was down 0.9% worldwide and down 1.6% in the US. Foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 4.10% while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%.\nI've gotten more than a few calls in the past few weeks as to how many pies we sold in the US leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. In the US in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, we sold 2.9 million of our famous pumpkin pies along with 1.3 million apple and pecan pies, so over 4 million pies in total during the three days.\nBack to the income statement here. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. In the quarter we reported $1.082 billion or 1.91%. That's an $82 million or 8.2% increase and a 4 basis points increase over the Q1 last year. In terms of renewal rates, at Q1 end, our US and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.8% while the worldwide rate came in at 90.5%.\nBoth of these rates were up 1.1 of 1% from those numbers 12 weeks earlier at the end of the Q4. Membership growth continues. We ended Q1 with 72.0 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year, and 129.5 million cardholders, up 7.1%, with consistent growth throughout the quarters. At Q1 end, we had 33.2 million paid executive members, an increase of 939,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end.\nExecutive members now represent a little over 46% of our paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the Q4 was higher year-over-year by 43 basis points, coming in, excuse me, coming in at 11.04%, up from Q1 of last year at 10.61%. That 43-basis point reported number, ex-gas deflation would be +36 basis points. As I normally do here, we write down two columns and six line items. The first column is reported in the Q1. The second column is margins excluding gas deflation.\nIt's the year-over-year change in the Q1 on a core merchandise +3 basis points reported, -3 basis points ex-deflation, ancillary and other businesses +24 reported and +22 ex-deflation, gas deflation 2% reward lower year-over-year -4 basis points reported and -3 ex-gas deflation, LIFO +3 and +3, and other +17 and +17 for a total again reported year-over-year up 43 basis points and ex-gas deflation up 36 basis points.\nStarting with the core again, it was a total company. It was +3 and -3 reported and ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales or core on core margins were up by 5 basis points year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin again higher by 24 and higher by 22 ex-gas deflation.\nThis increase was driven largely by gas and e-comm, our 2% reward higher by 4%, and higher by 3% deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO +3 basis points. We had a $15 million LIFO credit in the Q1 of this year. This compared to a very small half a million dollar LIFO charge in Q1 a year ago.\nThen the other line item that 17 basis points to the positive. As was mentioned earlier, last year in Q1 there was a 70 basis point impact from a $93 million pre-tax charge primarily related for the downsizing of our charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A, we reported SG&A of 9.45%, higher by 25 basis points than last year's 9.20%.\nAgain in Q1, we'll write down the two columns: reported and without gas deflation. Operations: -18 and -14 basis points, minus being, meaning it's higher year-over-year. Central: -2 and -1. Stock compensation: -3 and -2. Pre-opening expense: -2 and -2. Again, for a total reported margin higher -25 year-over-year.\nI'm sorry, SG&A, not margin, 25, and without gas deflation, higher by 19 basis points. The core, again, was higher by 18, and higher by 14 excluding the impact from gas. This included 12 weeks of this past March's extra top-of-scale increase in our wages. Which represents an estimated 2 basis points hit, and as of 18 September we raised the starting wage in the US and Canada. That estimated impact from those new wages to be roughly 2 basis points as well.\nAgain, central, nothing much to say other than it's 1 basis point higher excluding gas deflation. Again, with stock comp to -2x gas deflation and pre-opening. We did have a couple of more openings this year in the quarter than we did last year, and that was higher by 2 basis points.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $38 million this year, $4 million higher than last year's $34 million figure. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $107 million, coming in at $160 million this year versus $53 million last year. This was driven largely by the increase in interest income, about $100 million of that 107, due to higher cash balances. The small additional impact was a favorable FX year-over-year.\nIn terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the Q1 was 24.5%. This compares to 23.0% a year ago, or 1.5 percentage points higher this year than last year. The increase in our rate as of Q1 in Q1 is primarily attributable to lower benefit from the stock-based compensation from a year ago. Overall reported net income was up 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter.\nA few other items of note, in terms of warehouse expansion, in the Q1 we opened 10 locations including one reload, so a net of nine increases. Those nine included eight in the US and one in Canada. For the full year fiscal 2024 we estimate opening we're planning to open 33 locations including two reloads. So for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal 2023.\nFor Q2 fiscal 2024, we planned four new locations including our sixth building in China early in the calendar year. Regarding capital expenditures, the Q1 capital expenditure spend was approximately $1.04 billion. We estimate that fiscal 2024 CapEx will be in the $4.4 to 4.6 billion range. That's up from $4.3 billion we had in fiscal 2023, reflecting a continued increase in the number of the expansion that we're doing.\nIn terms of e-commerce business, e-comm sales in Q1 ex-FX increased 6.1%, the first quartly year-over-year increase in five fiscal quarters, and trended well during the three reporting periods of September, October, and November. E-comm showed strength in several areas in food, things like e-gift cards, pet items, snack items were up in the mid-teens. Appliances were up year-over-year in the mid-20s.\nTVs was actually in the high singles despite the challenges with other aspects of consumer electronics like computers, and tires were up in the low teens. So overall a pretty good showing there as well. Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries in the Q1 of fiscal 2024. We completed over 800,000 deliveries, which were up 17% versus the comparable quarter last year.\nAnd some fun wow items in the quarter. In e-commerce you've probably read about the fact that we sell 1-ounce gold bars. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter. We sold a Babe Ruth autographed index card for $20,000, and in addition to eGift cards on everything from restaurants to golf to airlines, we just in the last couple of weeks launched a Disney eGift card valued at $250 for $224.99.\nFor you last minute shoppers out there, there's a Mickey Mantle autographed 1951 rookie card in nearly perfect condition, and it's on sale online for $250,000. Next, good progress continues to be made with our e-comm mobile and digital efforts. No big enhancements and changes to the site leading up to the holidays, mostly holiday prep. We did have 100% site availability during Cyber Week, and sales for the five Cyber Days, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Cyber Monday, were up year-over-year in the mid teens.\nOur app downloads during the quarter were 2 1/3 million, so total app downloads now stand at 30.5 million, or a 10% increase during the quarter, and that's after being over 40% increase in all of fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. Our site traffic approaching a half a billion and just under 10% increase, and the average order value being up about 2.5%, so continue to make progress there.\nNext, a couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in the last Q4. Discussion we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 1% to 2 range. Our estimate for the quarter just ended, deflation was in the 0% to 1 range.\nBigger deflation and some big and bulky items like furniture sets due to lower freight costs year-over-year, as well as on things like domestics, bulky lower priced items. Again, where the freight cost is significant. Some deflationary items were as much as 20% to 30, and again mostly freight related. TVs, the average sale prices have been lower while units have been higher. And in talking to the buyers overall, our inventories and our SKU counts are in good shape across all channels, and so far we've had a good seasonal sell through during the quarter.\nLastly, as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we declared a $15 per share special cash dividend. This is our fifth special dividend in 11 years. The total payout will be about just under $6.7 billion and will be funded using existing cash and not accompanied by any issuance of debt. The special cash dividend will be paid on 12 January 2024 to shareholders of record on 28 December 2024.\nFinally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 31 December 2024 on Thursday, 4 January 2025 after market close. With that, I will turn it back for Q&A to Lisa and be happy to answer any questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, everyone, that is star one on your telephone. We'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Richard, you had indicated over the last year and a half or so that Costco had been raising prices faster than it had throughout its history. So now with prices coming down, what is going to be the posture on passing along those savings? You already noted that inflation is flat to up 1%. So do you expect inflation, especially on the food side, as you get through the next couple of quarters?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, talking to buyers, we've seen even during the quarter we saw the trend towards that zero versus the one. But at the end of the day, the buyers are looking out three to six months. On the fresh food side, commodities-wise, they haven't seen a lot. There are a few things that are up, and a few things are down, but no giant trend either way. Look, as you know us for a long time, we want to be the first to lower prices. We're out there pressing our vendors as we see different commodity components come down. Certainly on the non-food side as we saw shipping costs come down, things like that, and so probably a little more than less, but we'll have to wait and see. We don't know.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nIn my follow-up is another point that you've made for a long time, is that Costco's going to draft off the profitability of the broader retail sector. If we compare Costco's operating margin over the last 12 months versus where it was prior to the pandemic, it's three to 400 basis points higher. And yet across retail there are signs that profitability is coming down. So now what would stand in the way of Costco either maintaining this existing rate of operating profit margin or even further growing it from here? It's just simply going to be a function of your ability to drive further sales growth in the consistently mid- to single-digit range for better?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Well, happily I'm able to say that you get to figure that one out. At the end of the day, as you've known for a long time, we're a top line company. We want to drive sales. Certainly as there's been deflation in certain products, we've seen units go up. I'm looking at one example here. Just in the last month, $104 million of KS net items where sales were flat to down a couple percent while units were up in the mid teens. That takes a little more labor to do. But at the end of the day that's what we want to do. We want to drive people and frequency.\nI think as long as we see renewal rates continue to do what they do, as long as we see new signups continue doing what they do, and hopefully continue to get people to convert to executive as well and constantly driving the best value out there, we'll be in good stead. So far we've been able to do that, and I think we'll continue to be able to do that.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much and have a good holiday.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou too.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi there. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Thank you so much for taking our question. The core on core margin was up modestly this quarter, and it seems like it moderated sequentially. Looking forward to the balance of the year, it seems like the comparison gets a bit tougher, I guess. How should we think about your core on core margin? Could it stay expanding and positive for the rest of the year? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, there's so many different moving parts to it. You know, as you've heard me say in the last several years, we want to drive top line first. We're also pragmatic. We want it, we recognize we're a for-profit company and we'll continue to work hard to do both. I wouldn't read much into any number going up a little or down a little, frankly. It fluctuates, and there's lots of different components to it.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nGotcha. Thanks so much. Just a quick follow-up: was the Black Friday and Cyber Monday gains that you had better than what you were expecting internally? Thanks so much.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThey were a little better than we were expecting, but we were ready for it.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, how's it going, Richard? Good afternoon. I wanted to just dive into the core margins a little bit more and see if you could flesh out some of the category color. If you said it, I missed it, but food, sundries, fresh, and non-foods hardline parts of the business.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, without giving you specific basis points, food and sundries was slightly down, very slightly down. Non-food was actually up. Some of that relates to the fact that we were comparing against last year when we had higher freight costs, and trying to drive business, and fresh was down a little bit. So nothing earth shattering in either of those directions.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. And then on the ancillary, up 22 basis points. I think we all get the gas component, can you just talk about why the e-commerce margins were so much better in the quarter?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think, well, first of all, part of just ancillary, in general, is a sales penetration issue. Without going into it, that the fact that it showed more. Sometimes when you look back over the quarters, they go in opposite directions. The core on core and then the other businesses. And so given that you had higher sales penetration in both e-comm that helped you. And e-comm, we had a lot of strength. We're doing a lot of big and bulky, and we're driving that business.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay, great. Just bigger picture, I just have a question on the change at the COC with Ron starting in a few weeks and replacing Craig, who replaced Jim. You know, you've had the fortunate opportunity to work with all three and I guess I'm curious what change, if any, you think we could see from an operating standpoint moving forward.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, well, I always joke I'm up for review, so I'm going to say nice things, but no, at the end of the day, the reality is we're staying the course. You know, I remember questions were asked 12+ years ago when Craig became President and two years later Jim retired and Craig became CEO and President.\nAnd what's, you know, who can replace Jim? And I think the same questions asked today, who can replace Craig? And it really is a seamless transition. You have somebody retiring that's been here 40-ish years and that's been in the business both on operations and merchandising for a successful number of years in both. And you got Ron, who's coming in, who started when he was 17 at a Price Club in Arizona.\nAnd he already has his 40-year gold patch and, again, 30-ish years in operations, a year in real estate, traveling the world, and then six or seven years in merchandising. So I think it is pretty seamless. And to see them, the two of them, work together over the last two year, almost two years since Ron became President, it's very similar to what, you know, I saw during those two years when Craig became President. And then two years later Jim retired and Craig took on the CEO role as well. And so that's pretty much steady as she goes.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGotcha. Great. Happy holidays. Thanks.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nHey, Richard. I guess I just wanted to think about the potential clubs in the US. I know this comes up sometimes, but obviously you added eight. It just seems like there's maybe more runway even here in the US. And I wonder if you had any thoughts on that. And then I had a quick follow-up.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSure. Well, if we were to open the 31 this year, that would be somewhere in the low 20s, 23, 24 in the US. Now recognize a few of those are business centers, which we continue to add, as well as regular warehouses. Most of them are regular warehouses. And I would say that, yeah, I guess the story I'd share with you is six or eight years ago when it was roughly 60/40 or 70/30 US, Canada versus the international, other international.\nWe were asked what would it be by today? I'd say, well, by today it'll be 50/50. Well, today you're asking the same question. It's 60/40 or 70/30 today. What will be? I think it'll trend that way over time. But we are finding more opportunities in the US.\nClearly our average sales volume per location is higher today than we would have expected ourselves. Thankfully, you know, six, seven years ago, what would it be by now? We are finding those opportunities. So I view that as good news. We still, you know, we've got a lot of things going on to drive international, but you know, international will be, you know, six or seven units this year and that'll continue to grow. Last year international was nine or 10 and it's more of a timing issue.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nSo then my follow-up is around traffic and also like the growth you had in appliances and TVs. You're just kind of going in a different direction than a lot of people. So what's driving the share gains in those categories? But also, are you guys doing anything specifically different to drive the traffic numbers you're seeing? Because I mean they're pretty amazing given the environment.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah, well, look, I've always said I think the biggest attribute of value is the lowest price given quantity and quality of good or service. And then certainly add to that the trust that our members have. I think as it relates to specific things like I pointed out, like appliances and even tires, it's value.\nHaving acquired Innovel three or four years ago, now called Costco Logistics, we're doing a lot of business there, and I think we've gotten a better job of communicating what the value is, not just showing what the price of the exact item is at some of the other big retail competitors on some of these big items. But then you add in delivery, take away the old installation delivery, take away the old product for disposition. It's significant savings. Go do a price check of some of those things compared to our competition. That's where you'll see the strength.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nPerfect. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nRichard, I'm wondering if one of the things you may do differently here. We've talked about this before is leaning into personalization more and where you are on that, on that journey, particularly with Ron coming in.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nRight. Well, our first order of business was fixing the foundation. We're in the middle of re-platforming our e-commerce. It's not a big bang where we're going to flip the switch one day. We're bringing things over, and that's in progress. It was, I think, I mentioned last quarter. It's a two-year roadmap on that, and we're halfway through that.\nAnd so we've said very little so far. If we were, you know, if we were in the second inning, maybe we're in the third inning now. But a lot of the focus has been on first of all making sure, doing small improvements. We certainly got the, you know, the five-star rating, you know, got up north of four and a half on that, and we're getting better at the site every time.\nI think you would see personalization and first of all targeting and then personalization more over the next couple years, honestly, and we're fine with that. First order business is getting the foundation right and we've made a lot of progress. I didn't spend a lot of time on this call talking about the new things, the enhancements we've made to the mobile site and the e-comm site, but we've done a lot.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nAnd maybe as a follow-up, you talked about the international opportunity and it's still very well underdeveloped. So what the hindrance to getting to because we're in a lot of countries now, 15 to 20 annual openings maybe. That's a big ask, but you know, is it just quality of real estate? Because I would imagine operationally it's not a human resource issue. Is it purely a real estate issue?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI would say it's a combination of issues in some countries. I mean, if you look at Korea, Taiwan, where we have whatever 15 or 16 locations in each country, very successful, it's a little harder to find the next location just from a real estate standpoint. If you look in Japan where we have plenty of future opportunity, we've got 30 plus now, but again it's a little bit of real estate.\nIf you look at places like China or Spain, one of the challenges is you want, you like to be able to ideally bring over more than a handful of people from the existing locations in the new one. It's a very hands-on operation. I think one of the things that we felt we mentioned that we had success when we first opened our first unit in Shanghai is we had at least 60, 70 people move there from Taiwan for promotions and for interactions, not just in the office and the buying offices, but even in the key supervisor and manager positions within the warehouse. And so it takes a little longer, but we're working hard at it. But it's a very hands-on experience.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, Richard, thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to kind of follow up on Scott's question. I think your average sales per club in the US and Canada is around $300 million at this point. Just curious on the status of how many clubs are doing kind of well over that and are maybe in some need of some relief in the form of self-cannibalization. And more clubs nearby, and follow up as well on international. Just as we think about the next maybe three to five years, are there any countries that might be disproportionately getting some more of the growth here?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOkay, what was the first part of the question again? Oh, average sales. Yeah, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know in fiscal 2023 we had something like 25 or so locations that did over $400 million and another 160 or so that did $300 to 400 million. Those are huge numbers. And certainly as we get 350+ and one of them, by the way, that did over $400 million, did a few million, over $600 million.\nSo generally when it starts getting, when it starts having a three in front of it, certainly a 350, we want to start looking to see what we can do to cannibalize it frankly, and to have more growth in that market. So hopefully that's one of our bigger problems and challenges that we have more of those each year. So I think that will continue. Again, if I look back five, eight years ago, even assuming whatever inflation number you want to assume, I think we've done a little better than that in terms of these sales volumes. And so that's good news for us that we'll continue to do that internationally. Again, I'm just looking at the map of where we are. Certainly we only have four locations in Spain.\nWe've actually added a few on a base of 30+ in the UK. We think we have more opportunity in Mexico. In Japan, where we have something in the low 30s, certainly it's done well there, and there's many more markets and population there that we can go to. Australia is whatever a little under 2/3 the size of Canada, where we have 105 or so locations.\nAnd in Australia we have 15. Yeah, 15. I'm not suggesting we're going to have 2/3 of 105 there anytime soon. It took us 35+ years to get there in Canada, but we think that those are the opportunities. It's not like we're looking for a lot of other new countries at this juncture. We've done a few new countries. Those single locations like in Sweden, Iceland, and Auckland, all being somewhat managed buying-wise and somewhat operationally by a host country. In the case of Scandinavia, by the UK, in the case of Auckland, by Australia.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood afternoon guys. So Richard, last quarter you talked a bit about Costco Next. I guess my question is how big of an impact is that program having on your e-commerce sales at this point, number one. Number two, kind of related to that, any change in your vetting of what vendors operate on that program? Just thinking about the quality control aspect. Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, first of all, it's still very small relative to our company. The fact is that the Costco net sales currently are not in our sales. We get a commission. So it's kind of like 3P, if you will, 3P sales. And at some juncture, there are rules, accounting rules, of where you can include it in sales based on what risk and what ownership level you have in the items. But at this juncture, those sales, it's more of, more value than just the commission in our numerator.\nIn terms of how we vet, we do it the same way we vet items. We want items that make sense, that provide value. And we have a team that is here that are vetting each and every one of those. I think we're up to about 70, about 65 current suppliers on there, and we'll certainly have many more as we go forward.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nPresumably if that program keeps growing, should that be a natural gross margin driver for you over time? I know it's small now, but if you're just collecting the commission, presumably that's kind of 100% margin, right?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nEssentially, yes. Much like the travel business.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nMostly.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. Richard, want to follow up on the membership fee hike? Because I think now we're in extra time, and I wonder how much does the growth in mix and executive membership driving that high single digit growth? Is that what means that you don't have to increase it and you could keep waiting, or is there something else?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think it's just us. You know, again, if I look at the, if you ask the question, what are the variables we would look at? We would want to look at strong renewal rates, strong new signups, strong loyalty, and we have all that. So I think it's a question is we haven't needed to do it. We like providing extreme value. Certainly while we've gone a little longer than the average increase, we feel we certainly have driven more value to the membership. So I'll use my standby answer, my pat answer. It's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we feel pretty good about what we're doing.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nA follow up on inflation. I just want to make sure I got that right. You said zero one for the quarter. Did it trend towards zero? Did we exit near the bottom? You mentioned some categories that were deflationary. Which ones are stubborn in terms of inflation, where it's hardest to get it out?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWhich categories are stubborn in inflation?\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nCPG brands.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nMostly. All the branded packaged stuff.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThere wasn't a big trend. I think at the end it was a little lower than the beginning, but not a big trend.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, so it's not like we exited zero. We're still slightly positive.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nRight. But recognize the LIFO charge is an inventory cost of sales charge. Right. The zero one is from the beginning of the fiscal year. I'm sorry, the beginning of the zero one is versus a year ago.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYear-over-year. Got it.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Then this last. What is the auto renewal rate now?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAround 60%.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nIn the US, it's around 60%.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nPerfect. Thanks. Have a great holiday, guys.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou too.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go to operating expense growth. So operating expense growth is still high. Would you expect the growth rate to moderate once you lap that March wage increase And then anything unusual within that line item that's still driving pretty high growth?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThere's not a lot unusual. I think it gets back to the question of low inflation, which creates a little bit more of a challenge. Right. And again, that was a very extreme example I gave you on nuts. But when you had a slight 0 to 2% decline in sales and a 14% increase in units. You got more labor involved, more hours, stock to the shelf. I mean that's the 40,000-foot level and that's an extreme example, but I think overall.\nIt is sales based. I remember going back to fiscal 2019 and the first part of fiscal 2020 before COVID, you know, our SG&A percent was for all of 2019, it was a 10.04%. In the Q1 of 2020 it was a 10.34%. And for the whole year it was a 10.04% for both of those two years. And we used to think to ourselves, will we ever be able to get it back below 10%? And in 2022, which was the kind of month seven through 18, if you will, that 12-month period after that full fiscal year for us of COVID, we reported an 8.88% for that year. So even at the 9.45% that we just reported, we're still quite a bit lower than we had been historically.\nA function of a lot of things including higher sales productivity and all that. So I think we're doing pretty well. I think certainly that's the challenge. How do we reduce that and how do we manage that? Certainly the biggest way to manage it is driving more sales.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Then maybe just one follow-up question. Just curious how you're feeling about the health of your consumer. It was interesting to hear that TVs did well this past quarter.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nLook, I think when we're asked that question, we're fortunate to answer it that we're first of all looking at the consumer through somewhat rose-colored glasses here. We have enjoyed great value, and again we're convinced it's value. I think on the margin there's a few extra things that we've done. We've improved the site, the website. We've gotten a little better communicating stuff. Not completely, but I think overall, and we've been good merchants. I think the merchants have done a great job of bringing in new stuff. And not being shy. When we see an industry category down a lot that we can still, if we're driving people in, we've got a better chance of getting them to buy something.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Happy holidays.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\n\nTom Nass\n\nVP of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi, this is Tom Nass on for Oliver. Just a quick question on the trend of Kirkland relative to last year. If you could just remind us how that's trending maybe across categories, and then if you have any notable call outs, any recent innovations. Just curious if this is essentially driving any efficiencies in supplier negotiations that can position Costco for stronger gross margin ahead?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, I would say allowing us to get better deals, which means lower prices. But you know, look, I think we're, Kirkland Signature relative to non-gas sales is in the high 20s, and I think it was probably a good year ago when inflation was in the 8% and 9% range, if you will. If you remember, and we talked about that, year-over-year we saw probably the biggest increase penetration of KS at Costco. It was one one and a half percentage points when historically it had been 25 to 50 basis points a year.\nI think we're back to that, but we've maintained that higher level, and we're back to seeing smaller increases in penetration every year, but nonetheless still driving that business. But we've got, yeah, I think that helps with some of the deflationary stuff. Certainly with KS stuff we're closer to the supplier. We're not the only, we're the only customer buying that item and we can drive a little bit more business. So I think it just continues to work that way for us.\n\nTom Nass\n\nVP of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. And then just a quick follow up on any notable behavioral trends you've seen in consumer shopping this holiday season?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSome colleague in my room said they're buying gold. But no, that's actually online mostly. But no, I think, again, I think the traffic thing is the thing that we're happily surprised about, that we're continuing to drive people in on an increasing basis. You know, we know we benefited during those, call it those two years, kind of March-April 2020 to March-April 2022. The kind of the two years of COVID we benefited in many ways from more members and more volumes, and we've not only kept it; we're continuing now to add to those levels. So we feel very fortunate in that regard.\n\nTom Nass\n\nVP of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThanks.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nOne of my colleagues here just mentioned that discretionary merchandise trends are getting a little better. And that's not only on big-ticket, but in general, non-food kind of stuff. I think that corresponds with my comment earlier that we feel good about the seasonal, how we've done seasonally.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYeah, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess I wanted to ask on the Kirkland products specifically, maybe on the CPG that you mentioned, how pricing or how have prices trended on those versus the branded products? Have you seen any deviation there? Given you're closer, are you able to lower prices? I suppose to the extent that that has happened, do you notice any more market share changes within those CPG categories?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think it's slightly, it's deflationary, it's a little more deflationary in the KS than in the CPG, but which drives more value to KS, frankly. But we're seeing some our ability to work with our CPG customers, suppliers as well, but just a little stronger ability to do that with KS.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGot it.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nAgain, a comment in the room here we've had. It's allowed us to do some new item introductions on the KS side as well.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGreat. And then just following up on the last question, anything you can call out among the newer membership cohorts in terms of renewal rates versus the average.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nGenerally speaking, you know, if you compare, everybody was always concerned. I remember 10+ years ago people would ask how are you going after millennials? And then it's how are you going after the next gen or whatever, the Gen Z's or whatever.\nAt the end of the day when we look at the different cohorts, if you just change the names, the curve seems to be about the same in terms of getting new younger members. They buy less, they buy more as they get older into that 40- to 55-year-old sweet spot. I don't know in terms of renewal rates. I think our overall rates are improving, so I think we're probably doing a better job there. Certainly things like, frankly, auto renewal help that as well.\n\nMark Astrachan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGot. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSame to you.\n\nOperator\n\nTake our next question from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Richard, you mentioned about the wage increases that you've taken recently. I'm curious to get your thoughts about the wage increases that you've taken within the context of now the lower inflation that you're seeing, as well as what could be potential deflation further ahead. So curious about the ability for Costco to maybe maintain a more nimble margin structure amid what could be some volatility on the pricing side?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nFrankly, we look at the wages in a vacuum, and we want to do as much as we can for our employees. And certainly there were several increases starting with the frontline worker premium during the initial year of COVID. We kept half of that in there, which we kept one of those $2 an hour in there, which was like $400 million a year. Again, we've also benefited from stronger sales and productivity, so we were able to afford that.\nBut we look at them independently, and we'll continue to do that to look at it to the extent inflationary pressures are down, but that means there's probably a little less inflationary pressure on wages. But we give, you know, over half of our employees are top of scale, and they're getting increases irrespective of some of the extra things we talked about every March. And then as you go from a new employee over the first nine or 10,000 hours, you're getting constant increases that are more significantly more.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. And then just piggybacking off of that. I understand it may be difficult to attribute a cause and effect relationship to this, but do you think that perhaps the moderating inflation that we've seen in the need-based categories like fresh and food and sundries may have unlocked a little bit of extra wallet to spend in the non-foods category and may have driven some of the momentum that you've seen in categories like TVs and others?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI think it can't hurt. You know, even with gas prices have come down a little bit. You know, that's top of mind every week when somebody fills up their tank. So those things help. I'm sure on a macro basis that's the case, but it's a guess on our part.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, Richard, guys, thanks for taking my questions. There's really two big debates the clients are asking us about. First one's on gross margins, and in particular the potential for a gross margin impact from mix shift back toward things like appliances and TVs, which are notoriously lower gross margin, at least in the marketplace, versus fresh foods and food and sundries.\nAs you see, the sort of big-ticket discretionary starting to come back a little bit. Do you expect any overall impact on gross margins from that mix shift away from food and sundries to big-ticket discretionary?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYou know, first of all, our margin range is so much more compacted than traditional retail, different categories of traditional retail. I mean, if you think about it, we have what, a 12% to 13 gross margin? 11? I'm thinking mark's up. In theory, it ranges from 0 to 15. In reality, there's very few things that are below 5. A lot of things hover around the 8 to 12 range.So I don't think it's as big of an impact to us in terms of those mix changes. I got to say, it's always that old saying. It's always something. There's always something that hurts you, and there's another thing that helps you, and it's a really, it's a mixture.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nSo true. And then the other, the other big debate that clients are asking about is the relative profitability of new stores versus existing stores. There's sort of two themes. There one is new US versus existing US, and then the relative profitability of new stores internationally. I was wondering if you could speak to that a bit.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, first of all, when you look at an ROI, the I in the denominator on an older building has a lower I. If 10 years ago, the typical building in the United States, property, equipment, and building and fixtures, I'm shooting from the hip here, was $30 to 35 million, and now it's $45 to 50 million. So you've got a different eye.\nBut generally speaking.When we look at the ROI of each of our eight US regions, our two Canadian regions, new units come in, start a little lower, and get up there. Over time, you'll have some outliers because of some units that are 30 and 40 years old. Even with the ROI increased because we expanded the unit and upgraded it and remodeled it. The fact of the matter is those higher volumes really shine through there. On an international standpoint, we've always, I think, talked about the fact that there's a few different things that the ROIs in some of these other countries tend to be a little higher.\nThe return on sales tends to be even higher than that in some of these countries because a combination very little related to gross margin, some related to membership fees, some related to wages, and some related to benefits, health benefits, you know, US healthcare costs dwarf every other country that we're in.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGot it. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Good holidays and thanks for the pie.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on executive member penetration. It seems like it continues to inch higher, and I just wondering how you guys think about that and like how high should that be? I mean, presumably you'd want everybody to be an executive member, but is there like kind of a natural level where you think it can still go from here beyond the 46%?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation",
    "content2": "I think. Well, there's always going to be another country or two we add. You need a certain number, in our view. We've always done it after. There's 15 or so warehouses in the country, so that'll add to it a little bit. But no, I think some of the increase, it's kind of like getting up to that asymptotic line when you.\nOne of the things that drove it in the last few years, one, we've done a better job in the last several years of selling it to you as well as auto renewal. When people come in now or sign up online, they're signing up. They'll want to put their credit or debit card in there, and they can opt out. They can opt into doing it online, doing auto renewal. So I think those things have pushed it along, with us being so wonderful. But I think you'll still see come up a little bit, but probably that rate of increase will slow over time.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nGot. Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow-up. Anything to talk about on shrink because I know that, you know, there was an issue with shrink even for you guys at one point, and I know you guys have cracked down on, you know, making sure members are showing their cards when they walk in the store, and obviously that when you leave with your goods, they're, they're checking your receipts. But anything we should think about with regard to shrink going forward and recent trends?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThankfully, nothing at all. It's really, you know, I think all we talked about was a combination of, as we went into some self-checkout over the last several years, and then perhaps more recent things that you read about in the paper. We get less impacted by the latter as well. Maybe we saw a couple of basis points delta upward on a very low number of basis points to start with. So we're fortunate in that regard.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nThank you and happy holidays guys.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nSame to you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Laura Champine with Loop Capital.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into some of those numbers on the column. The ancillary profit improvement, I think that's where you're. I'm just wondering what drove that. And on the operations line, it sounds like that pressure in SG&A didn't come mostly from wages, and I'm wondering where it did come from.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYep. Yeah. On the ancillary line, it's gas and e-comm, and it's a combination of increased sales penetration and increased merchandise margins within those businesses. You know, the thing about gas is I think everybody out there that has gas stations. What we have found is we've been able to see improved profitability not just in the last quarter or two, but over the last few years, last three to five years, improved profitability in gas because others are making more and we're allowed to make a little more.\nWhen we do our competitive price shops on gas, which we do weekly at every gas station we operate, with our neighboring competitive gas stations, our value proposition is actually increased number of cents per gallon than we've ever seen. So that's been, if you will, a win-win for us on the e-comm side, I think driving more sales has helped us in the margins there as well.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nThanks. And then just on the operations.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nYeah. On the wages. Well, we pointed out. I pointed out on the call. I think there was like four or so basis points in total from those two distinct increases. We do other increases, like over half of our employees are top of scale. They get an increase every March. That's significant as well, significant relative to basis points when you have lower sales figures. The rest of it is all the other line items like energy costs and the like.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nGot it. So most of the pressure is probably coming from wages, not just those two discrete call outs you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nI'd say more than half. I don't have the exact figures with me.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Consumer Analyst, Loop Capital\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard Galanti for any additional or closing.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Lisa. Thank you everyone on the call. We're around to answer questions and have a happy holiday. I think this is a record time of finishing this call. Enjoy the holidays. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect.\nLet's conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation."

Today's call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.\nThe risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the Q4 of fiscal 2023, the 17 weeks ended 3 September 2023.\nThese results and the figures presented today compared to last fiscal year's 16-week Q4. Reported net income for the 17-week Q4 came in at $2.16 billion, or $4.86 per diluted share, compared to $1.868 billion, or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week Q4 last year. In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week Q4 were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $70.76 billion in the 16-week Q4 last year. Comparable sales for the Q4, and these figures are like-for-like number of weeks. In the US, reported was a 0.2% comp. Excluding gas deflation and FX, in the US, it would have been a 3.1%. Canada reported was a 1.8%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 7.4%. Other international reported 5.5%, and again, excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%.\nAll told, total company reported 1.1% comp and a 3.8% ex-gas deflation, and FX. In terms of e-commerce, that came in at a -0.8% reported and a -0.6% excluding FX. Overall, for the fiscal Q4, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the non-foods categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.0% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the US, impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket non-foods discretionary items as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impact sales by approximately 0.3%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%.\nNext, on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the Q4, $1.509 billion, or 1.95% of sales in the Q4 this fiscal year, compared to $1.327 billion, or 1.88% in Q4 of last year. So a $182 million increase, or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7 would be roughly a 7% ex that extra week. Excluding FX in the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our US and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up a 0.1% from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3.\nThe worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down 0.1%, reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower rate in large part because of new openings internationally. Membership growth continues. We ended Q4 with 71.0 million paid household members, up 7.9% versus a year ago, and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6%. And that's on new openings over the past year of just under 3% increase in new locations. At Q4 end, we had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3 end. Executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately 73% of worldwide sales.\nMoving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in Q4 came in higher, came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago. And the up 42 basis points is up 16 basis points excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation.\nThe first line item would be core merchandise on a reported basis, up 51 basis points year-over-year in Q4, and gas deflation up 28 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, a -32 and a -38. 2% reward, -4 and -2. LIFO, +27 and +28. And you total that up on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points year-over-year, and ex-gas deflation up 16 basis points. Starting with the core, again, up 51 year-over-year and ex-deflation up 28. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core and core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries, and non-foods being up and fresh foods being down a little.\nAncillary and other business gross margin was lower by 32 basis points and lower by 38 basis points ex-gas. This was driven almost entirely by gas. If you look at the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-com, food court, business centers, optical, and all those things, on a relative basis, year-over-year, were within a couple of basis points ± from a year earlier, 2% reward, higher by 4 and higher by 2 basis points, so a negative 2 basis points excluding gas deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, of course, if you recall last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pre-tax LIFO charge. While there was a small charge this year of $30 million, on a year-over-year basis, of course, that showed the basis point improvement in margin.\nWhile we continue to see sequential improvement in year-over-year inflation, I'll talk about that a little later. We've still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal year. That's the small charge in Q4. A couple of final comments on margins. First, we are asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The answer is no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than one basis point more. So no, thankfully, not a big issue for us. And second, year-over-year margin improvement has in part been due to fewer markdowns due to better inventory positions this year than last.\nOur inventories overall are in good shape. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the Q4, 8.96, up from 8.53% a year earlier, or up 43 basis points, and ex-gas deflation up 21 basis points. Again, jot down the two columns of numbers, both reported and excluding gas deflation. Operations, -37 basis points, minus being higher by. And without deflation, core would be -18. Central, -6 and -3. And those are really only two line items. The others were all zero, stock compensation, pre-opening, and other. So total reported margins were up 43 basis points year-over-year, and ex-gas deflation up 21 basis points.\nIn terms of the core operations being higher by 18 ex-gas deflation and on a reported basis higher by 37, this negative included the impact of lower sales growth as well as the impact of eight weeks of additional top-of-scale wage increases that went into effect 4 July 2022, so midway through Q4 last year, and a full 17 weeks of this past March's higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Central being higher by three basis points ex-gas deflation, again, not a lot of sales operating leverage there. Again, as I mentioned, the other line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so zero year-over-year change. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a year ago, one extra week, of course.\nInterest income and other for the quarter was higher by $171 million year-over-year, $238 this year versus $67 last year. This was driven in large part by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances, as well as the extra week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year-over-year. In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the Q4 came in 27.1% compared to 25.4% in Q4 last year, so a full 1.7 percentage points higher year-over-year. This increase in our rate as of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs a higher income tax rate than in the US.\nOverall, reported net income was up 16% year-over-year in the quarter, or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year in Q4 versus last. A few other items of note. In Q4, we opened nine net new warehouses, including five new buildings in the US, two in China, and one each in Japan and Australia. That, for the full fiscal 2023 year, we finished with 23 net new units, as well as we did three relocations. For Q1, the first 12 weeks of fiscal 2024, we plan on opening 10 net new units, as well as relocating one unit. All 10 net new locations: nine are in the US, and one in Canada.\nRegarding capital expenditures, we've actually included the cash flow in the quarterly report, but CapEx spend in Q4 was approximately $1.56 billion, and for all of fiscal 2023, it totaled $4.32 billion. Turning to e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the Q4 ex-FX, as I mentioned, decreased 0.6% year-over-year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement. Results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the previous two fiscal quarters, big ticket discretionary, majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, and hardware, were down 15% and 20% year-over-year respectively, and down just 5% year-over-year in the Q4, with those big ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales.\nA couple of other items of note, within the sales of big-ticket discretionary, appliances were up over 30% in the quarter. Second, I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling 1oz gold bars. Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours, and we limit to per member. Lastly, I'll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 62 suppliers on costconext.com, and we're continuing to onboard additional ones in many product areas, from home improvement to apparel to pet to home and kitchen to electronics and accessories to sports and bicycles and toys and the like. Excuse me. Now, a few comments on e-comm mobile digital efforts, which we're always asked about.\nAs I discussed during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we've recently redesigned the account page and the digital membership card. We also redesigned the header with larger search bar and expanded selling space. We've added an app box for messages and advertisements right in the app. We've recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses. And lastly, there are ongoing improvements in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools for our customers, such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse savings, seeing the gas prices, to the extent there's a gas station there.\nSoon you'll be able to search warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far, over the past year, our app store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in the site are up 40% year-over-year, and the Costco app installs are up 46% year-over-year. So all in all, progress is being made. Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation. Most recently, in Q3 2023, we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4 inflation is in the 1% to 2% range, and it's actually trended downward during the quarter. So hopefully these inflation trends will continue. We'll have to see.\nFinally, in terms of upcoming releases, we'll announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 1 October 2023, on Wednesday, 4 October 2023, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back over to Lisa. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question today, you can press star one on your telephone keypad, and to remove yourself from the queue, it is star one again. We'll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Richard. How are you?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nGood.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI guess my first question, I don't mean it tongue in cheek, but I guess, is a membership price increase part of the fiscal plan? And then part of the question is, is there a point at which this membership increase is part of, I guess, a hedge against inflation? Is there a point at which the model feels more weight without it? In other words, can you go another year without it?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, my pat answer to your question, of course, is it's a question of when, not if. It's a little longer this time around since June of 2017, so we're six years into it. But you'll see it happen at some point. We can't really tell you if it's in our plans or not. We'll let you know when we know. We feel good, needless to say, about all the attributes of member loyalty and member growth. And frankly, in terms of looking at the values that we provided our members, we continue to increase those at certainly a greater amount than even more than if and when an increase occurs. So stay tuned. We'll keep you posted, but there's not a whole lot I can tell you about that.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nFair enough. And then ultra short term, as gas prices have moved up, have you seen any effect or impact on spending at the store?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nNo. I mean, you look at the numbers over the last few months that we report monthly and quarterly. There's not been a heck of a lot of change. Big-ticket discretionary, while improved relatively, as I mentioned, online, those online items, we've seen the number of items in a basket tick up a little in the last few months, but I think that has more to do with the fact that we consciously added. I think I mentioned in the last call, we've consciously added 40 or 50, what I'll call smaller-ticket indulgent items, whether it's snack items and the like, to just impulse items. And so that's what we do as merchants. But overall, we haven't seen any big change or been able to correlate any big change to what's happened with gas prices.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks, Richard. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Good afternoon. I just say thank you so much for taking my question. Richard, you ended your prepared remarks saying that this quarter or this month, inflation's on pace to be 1% to 2%, and you suggested it may be even lower than that. So should outside observers be prepared for the prospect of deflation, either because that's what's happening with some underlying costs that Costco's been experiencing, or Costco will look to invest in price as a way to continue to drive volumes, especially at a time when core-on-core margins are expanding so nicely?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, first of all, the comment that was one to two, but then as we look at the 17 weeks, if you were over the four months roughly, we saw if we looked at it internally at each of the end of those four months, we saw the level that one to two is from the beginning to the end of the year. I'm sorry, the beginning to the end of the quarter, but during the quarter, we saw that trending downward, if you will, a little. And when I talked to the merchants on the fresh side, it's flat down a little right now. On the food and sundry side, it's up a little, primarily in some of the CPG stuff. And on big ticket, or not big ticket, but on non-foods, partly because of freight, which is down year-over-year in a nice way.\nIn some cases, some of the commodity costs on steel and the like, that's come down. That being said, not a big change, but at least it's trending that way. Who knows what tomorrow brings? As it relates to.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo just.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I was going to say, as it relates to us, we're always pushing prices as fast as we can. We want to be the first to lower them when those things happen and drive sales.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI think we've seen that with our traffic.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo, just to clarify, what you're saying is food and sundries prices are down on average year-over-year. Shelf-stable products are up year-over-year. Gen merch is down. So in totality, it would seem like the box is deflating. Does the rate at which you see deflation continue to increase from here? And would you expect that to be just driven by the factors that you mentioned, or are you driving that as a way to drive this traffic?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, first of all, I want to correct one thing that maybe I misstated or you misunderstood. In terms of fresh, fresh is pretty much flat. Food and sundries, which is everything from sundries, packaged goods, and CPG goods, that tends to be up a little bit. And I'd like to think that we're pushing the envelope as much as we can with our suppliers, that as certain freight costs have come down, recognizing the headline today in the paper is, \"Oil's approaching $100 a barrel.\" So who the heck knows what's going to happen tomorrow?\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. My follow-up question is, as long as you see big ticket under pressure or discretionary under pressure, which influences your total sales because it's important for your member to come in and buy these big ticket items, is this going to influence how you think about managing labor in the store? Should the market just anticipate that labor and other SG&A is going to delever as long as the big ticket's under pressure?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I think we've seen that over the last year, frankly. We had such operating leverage over a couple of years when we had outside sales during the kind of the two years of COVID, call it the spring of 2020 to the spring of 2022. And it was before COVID when our SG&A was over 10%, slightly over 10%, and we said, \"Would it ever be able to get below that?\" It's now still below 9%. So now, with that as the fact, when I've looked at the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, again, particularly in the last couple of quarters, we've seen some deleverage of that. And look, we want to drive sales, and we'll do that in the best ways we can.\nBut we recognize when we used to get the question all the time, \"What number do you need to have zero, negative or positive leverage with SG&A?\" Recognizing there was very little inflation back then. But we used to say somewhere, who knows, but somewhere in the four and a half to five range. So we don't know exactly where it is, but we're certainly not going to change the level of service that we have. And we're certainly going to respect our employees in terms of what we've done with wage increases over time. And that's what we do.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey. I'm Richard. Just sticking on the inflation topic here on unit elasticity, particularly in categories where you're seeing prices actually start to fall or compress. Curious what you're seeing on units, if you're seeing them improve at all to offset those price declines, and if there's any examples in either food or in GM that you could talk about.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I remember when we talked a few quarters ago about some of the slowness in big ticket discretionary. When we got hotter on prices, it did a little bit, but not as much as we would have thought to start with. But again, that perhaps was the impact of what's going on with the concerns in the economy and everything else. We know that when we put hot buys and what we call TPDs, temporary price discounts, on items, even medium-sized ticket items, we do see the units increase, but it's not as predictable, I would say, as it used to be.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Great. I know you guys don't provide guidance, but go ahead.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nIt's a little easier on the food side to see that sometimes when we take the price of a meat item down.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. So you are starting to see some units increase as prices drop in certain parts of the business then?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Gotcha.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. And by the way, even on big ticket, when we've seen $3 and $400 price declines because of freight and raw material costs on some big ticket non-food items, we'll see some of the sales pick back up on that. But there's nothing guaranteed.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you. And I know you don't provide guidance, but I actually do remember when you did give some directional help back in the day. But are there any big puts and takes that we should be thinking about on the gross margin and SG&A line over the next four quarters that we should be thinking about? Clearly, the LIFO lap will be an obvious tailwind, but just curious, any other things that we should be thinking about from a modeling perspective?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nNo, not really. I mean, LIFO is certainly one that was an impact over the last year and started to slow down. Assuming that trend continues, there won't be much LIFO going forward for right now, but we'll see. Beyond that, no, we're still opening. We opened 23 net new units this past year. We're on board to do something in the mid to high 20s this year. But that's not enough to move the needle in terms of a leverage standpoint or anything. No, I'd say it's steady as she goes. And if anything, I look at the margins overall, given everything that's going on, including competition, that we're doing pretty well there.\nWith some of the wage hikes that we've continued to do and sales being a little weaker than they had been a year ago, I think we're doing pretty well on that as well. We're optimistic about our future, but we'll see what happens.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Richard, first, we're just on LIFO. Just curious, I mean, the $30 million charge, it's small, but just curious why there even was one. Can you give us a little more color, maybe what drove it?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Well, I think it was on things like, well, gas was one. And then in some of the fresh food items, even though there was deflation in things like eggs and some dairy products, there were some inflationary trends in beef. Beyond that, do you have that handy? Yeah. It's really small, but on 16 billion of inventory, it's a lot. I mean, it's still a small number, $30 million. But on.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI don't have the details beyond that.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThat's fine. Yeah. No, that's fine. Just in the context of broader disinflation and all this stuff, it's just interesting to see that. And then just really turning to the international stuff, you talked about the real rates impact. Can you remind us maybe on the international membership trends? When you open up a new club outside the US, maybe give us some framework or some benchmarks around how many new members tend to sign up? How does that compare to what you would see, let's say, in the next club you open in the US? And then what kind of renewal rates you tend to see year one, year two, just so we have a frame of reference there. Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but generally speaking, in Asia, whether it's Korea, Taiwan, Japan, or China, we'll open a new unit, including the 10 or 12 weeks of sign-ups prior to opening, with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 new members. We had a couple of extremes like when we first opened in Shanghai and Minhang of well over 200,000. Now, some of that's looky-loos that don't renew. And usually, in that first year of renewal and those types of outsized numbers, we might be as low as the mid to high 50s, and it takes a few years to get even to the mid 70s. But we see those numbers overall continue to increase every year. And I can't go I should probably go back to what it was in the first 10 years of our 40-year history with even the US.\nMy guess it wasn't that extreme, but we didn't have as many. It wasn't national and local news events the day we opened. You had a lot of people coming into some of these markets that are signing up that maybe live too far away or choose not to come back. So we're seeing that continuing to grow. So even that simple, that slight 0.1% decline, it's a rounding error in the sense that if you open up a couple more units a year ago, then they're just renewing for the first time, that increases that number.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYep. No, understood. Last question. I think I heard you say mid to high 20s in terms of unit opening plan for fiscal 2024. Can you give me a sense of how many of those are in the US and then how many would be international? Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSeventy-plus percent in the US and Canada. Mostly US, of course.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGot it.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWhich, in my view.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks so much.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWe're finding more opportunities in the US to infill, given our high volumes. We've had plenty going on over the years overseas.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYep. Thanks so much, Richard.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate in Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I guess first, I was hoping maybe you could give us a quick download maybe on how you're feeling about the health of your consumer right now. I mean, obviously, some concerns out there on student loan impacts starting to roll in here as those restart. So maybe any color you can provide on how you're thinking about discretionary from here, maybe some of those concerns out there, anything on trade-down or private label, anything of note on that front in terms of consumer behavior as well.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nRight. Well, look, first of all, first and foremost, our traffic continues to do very well. Being up continually 4% and 5% on a year-over-year basis is great. And our renewal rates continue to be very strong. So that's a starting point. It makes sense to us on big ticket discretionary. That's where you'd see the biggest weakness. We see some of that in some areas going back. When we look at our numbers compared to NPD, that tells us where we are versus our competitors. Overall, not in every category, but overall, we tend to do better. So even a negative number here is a lower negative number than elsewhere. And again, what did we do? We brought in some smaller ticket items that are impulse snack items to get an extra partial item in everybody's basket. Yeah. And newness, bringing in those new items.\nThere's not been a whole lot in television. Our unit sales in TVs are pretty good, but the average price point has come down. As they do anyway, there's always deflationary when you don't have new technology yet. We haven't seen a whole lot of new stuff yet there. Gaming is good right now. Christmas is good. I mean, we're one of the, not the only one, but one of the few that are bringing in seasonal items early. Everything from decor to trees to toys. That's starting off well so far. It's new. It's in the last few weeks.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate in Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. That's really helpful. Then just oh, no, go ahead.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI'm sorry. What else did you ask?\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate in Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, yeah. And then just shifting gears, so I just wanted to touch on retail media. So obviously, a significant focus on driving retail media at some of your peers. So just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about what Costco is doing in this area and the bigger opportunities that your team sees here.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, part of that is some of the things we're doing with digital, mobile, and the app. And we're not giving out quantifiable numbers, but certainly, some of our competitors have been talking about doubling these numbers in the next two or three years. In my view, there's some low-hanging fruit out there, and we're actively working on it. We've hired a couple of people that are helping us with that as well. And more to come.\n\nErica Eiler\n\nAssociate in Equity Research, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.\n\nBrandon Cheatham\n\nVP of Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nHey, everyone. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to, when you look at the retail landscape, I was wondering, how do your wages compare to your competition? Are you seeing similar trends in inflation pressure on the wage front? And anything that you can help us with, what your plans are over the next couple of quarters?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, first of all, we've always prided ourselves in providing the best hourly wage package out there: wages, benefits, contributions to 401(k). I'm using US numbers here, but our average: US, 90% of our employees, like many big retailers, are hourly. And our average hourly wage is approaching $26. It's in the high $25s. That's on top of a very rich healthcare plan where the employee only pays around 11% or 12% of it, I believe, and a little less than that. And on top of that, irrespective of what an employee contributes to his or her 401(k), we contribute anywhere from 3% to 9% based on years of service. So you've got a 20-year cashier making on a full-time basis in the mid $60s, with another $4,000 or $5,000 being contributed to his or her 401(k) plan with a very rich healthcare plan.\nSo we stand apart in our view compared to anybody. Our pressure comes from ourselves. In the last few years, as there have been wage pressures, starting with the frontline workers during the beginnings of COVID, we, like many retailers, added a 2% premium, $2 premium rather. We kept it longer, to our knowledge, than most anybody for a full year. And at the end, we kept a dollar in there. And since then, we've had at least three or four increases on top of the normal top-of-scale increase that we generally have done every year. We have done every year. So in our view, the pressure comes from us, and we feel that we're way ahead of our competition in that regard.\n\nBrandon Cheatham\n\nVP of Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thanks. And I think you mentioned that the next iteration of the app, you're going to be able to scan bar codes. Is the idea that eventually the customer is going to be able to scan and go? And how could that help slow operations in your stores if that is the case?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI don't think we're prepared for scan and go yet. We're just going to scan, but they can't go. At the end of the day, the first order of business is getting the merchandise on there and have numbers where a member even goes online to say, \"Hey, you can also get this currently at your local location.\" So knowing what's in store when somebody wants to come out, I think that's going to be a big positive to start with. And part of the scan is to be able to get more product information on the item as well.\n\nBrandon Cheatham\n\nVP of Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGotcha. That makes sense. Okay. I appreciate it. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks. I had two questions, Richard. First, I'd love an update given the volatility in gas prices the last year and a half as to where we are on penny profit. I know it had improved a lot, but I'm curious if it came back down in the last 12 months or if it sort of stabilized at that higher level.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, we don't give specific numbers. Gas has been stronger for us, and we believe all retailers in the last few years. In fact, it was Q4 last year, which I think was our strongest quarter, recognizing it's a 16-week quarter. This Q4, it was still strong, down from its strongest a year earlier on a weekly basis, but nonetheless quite strong. And so it's part of the profit picture currently of all big retailers that sell gas: the supermarkets, the Walmarts, and the Costcos of the world. So it's still a profitable business.\nOur view has been it used to be when prices, given that we turn it so fast, literally almost daily, when profits are going up, and I'm sorry, when the price of gas is going up, the guy down the street who's turning it every eight or nine days is paying a little less four days ago. And so we make a little less. And when sales went down, the price per gallon went down, we made a little more. I think that equation, while it's still true, is not the driver of the bottom line of gas. Everybody seems to be wanting to make more in gas, which allows us, in our view, to make a little more and still be even more profitable.\nWe've seen our competitive spread versus our direct competitors at every location, on average, improve over the last couple of years to now be in the, I want to say, the $0.30 range per gallon. Mid $0.30s is the average, which is up. It's an average, and it can range from $0.10 to $0.45. But at the end of the day, we feel good about our competitive position. It's increased, and we're still quite profitable. Down a little bit from a year ago, but nonetheless quite profitable.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThat's helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on cash. I think you finished it with $13.7 billion. I think the last time you got the 13 was when you had a special dividend in 2020. What are your thoughts on how much cash you need or want? And especially now that there is a positive interest rate on holding cash, does that make you more interested in keeping it? But then you pay more tax. Just how do you think about it?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I think it's, look, at the end of the day, we've done four special dividends in the past. It's part of our DNA. At some point, we may do that again. Again, it's somewhat like the answer to the other question about membership fees. It's probably a question of when, not if. But we'll let you know. Certainly, with earning 5%-ish on that money instead of 0.25%-ish on that money, it does make it a little harder to do. But we're not selling at the kind of earnings multiple that we are to earn 5% on our assets. So at some point, we'll do something, and we'll have to wait and see.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. Thanks. And good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question, Richard. Just wanted to ask, I think I've asked this many, many times, but it seems like another huge quarter for executive membership growth, almost a million more this quarter. And I was just curious if you could talk about the profile of that member today that's either upgrading or starting out as executive. What's the characteristics of that customer? And any changes in how that executive member spends in their first year in that upgrade compared to the prior years?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, I was joking to say, first of all, they're very smart to be an executive member. Look, I think over time, we've done a better job of communicating the value of the executive member. So we clearly get more people to sign up that way in advance. And we see that over time, a regular member over the first few years will buy more every year. And an executive member starts at a higher level and will buy more every year from that higher level. So that's really the profile that we've seen. I don't have any specifics on how old the member is.\nI know that when we look at age characteristics of new members, everybody used to be concerned 10 years ago, \"How are we going to get Millennials when we have an older average customer and all that?\" And we did with items, with things like organic. We're doing the same thing now. We're still getting our whether it's Gen Z or Gen A or whatever the next gen is, we are getting our share of those new members when we look at the profile of our members.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Richard, I may have missed this, but did you quantify the extra week impact in terms of EBIT or EPS or anything for us?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nNo. I mean, the simple math would just say it's 17th of our quarter is equal to a 16-week quarter. That's about as good as we could do. But it takes that on net income; it takes the 16% or whatever percent number down to a nine or something. That's just simple math.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nPerfect.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, Richard. Inventory seemed well-positioned. What are your thoughts about where they are now and also how we will model them going forward relative to sales? And then as we look at overall ticket trends being negative, that comp starts to ease. So does that imply that will inflect, partly on the nature of the ticket comparisons overall? The same question for e-commerce. As we anniversary some of the headwinds, can we expect the comparison to help as well? Thanks a lot, Richard.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Inventories, as I mentioned, the merchants feel very good about our inventory levels right now. Are there a few departments that are a little higher than they want, a few that need a little bit more? Sure. But overall, they're very good. In fact, you look at our fiscal year-end, inventory stood at just under $16.7 billion, and payables stood at $17.5 billion. So I think running above 100% on that simple ratio is something new. We used to enjoy running 90% to 95%. It fluctuates. But overall, we feel good about our inventories where they are now. And in terms of supply chain, things coming in on time, we feel good about that as well.\nNow, as it relates to, excuse me, as we anniversary the inflection of when we saw some weakness, I think a couple of quarters ago, I mentioned that, \"Well, what will help your big ticket sales?\" I said, \"Well, at least in a few several more months, we'll anniversary this weakness.\" So certainly, that's going to help. I would like to think that it's not just that thing that's going to help. And the same with e-commerce. I mean, again, one bright spot in virtually all e-commerce, not nearly all e-commerce, it is nearly all e-commerce, was the appliances. And I think we've done a better job also of showing the value of these items online, not just the price of the item, which in our case includes delivery, warranty, and things like that, more so than some of our competitors and showing great value there.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thanks, Richard. Just a couple of short ones. Any thoughts on Instacart? It seems like it's a really great partnership that you've had for a while. Also, another question we had is, will EV charging play a role in how you're thinking about future services for customers? Finally, China. It's a smaller percentage of total, but it's an important market for the long term. Lots happening there. Has anything changed the value proposition or the geopolitics? Thanks.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nOkay. Yeah. I had the second and third. What was the first question?\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nInstacart.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nOh, Instacart. Look, I know they just went public, so we got a lot of questions. At the end of the day, we're a good partner with them. They're a good partner for us. We use them throughout the US and Canada. And sales are growing. We've added, over the last during COVID, we added some non-food items that still can be carried in the car, if you will. And we're doing, I think, prescriptions with them now. And so no, it's a good relationship and has been for a while. Yeah. I might add, though, that with regard to those sales, we include that in our warehouse sales, not our e-commerce sales, because it's their employee or their employee coming into Costco to shop, purchase at the register, and then take it to the customer. So that's not in our mobile or e-commerce sales.\nAs it relates to EV charging, we're testing it in a number of locations. Not a whole lot to be said. If there's a charge for it, it's going to be less at Costco. And we'll wait and see. And then as it relates to China, no, we just opened a few weeks ago our fifth location. We have two more planned this fiscal year, both in the, I think, one in Shenzhen in early calendar 2024 and one other one before the end of August. So we'll have seven locations up from two a year and a half ago. And so far, our openings there have treated us well overall.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Best regards.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood evening, guys. Can you help us understand a bit better how the Costco Next process works? I mean, is it similar to how your e-commerce business used to work, where products were essentially drop-shipped from your vendors? And if that's the case, Richard, how do you control the quality of the product and delivery process? Because I thought that became an issue for you guys before you took over your own distribution for e-comm.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Costco Next is drop-shipped. We curate the items with these suppliers. And they're, for the most part, pretty well-known brands. And so far, we have not had an issue on that, recognizing they tend to be items that are easily shipped to a home. Yeah. And we have all the tracking information as well. So all I can tell you is you're right about that. That's a good point. Years ago, when we did this, there was a difference. But so far, it's worked quite well for us. We've had very few customer issues as it relates to items purchased on costco.com or costconext.com.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you. Then another inflation question. If we do wind up getting outright deflation outside of improved traffic or unit velocity, are there ways to protect margin? Because it seems to me like that could wind up being a deflator to the margin if we're in a deflationary environment there.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, look, that's what our business is about. We'll take a 10-pack and make it a 12-pack, I guess. But at the end of the day, if there's a little disinflation, it'll impact all of us. But again, I think it should be favorable with us because we'll still show the best value out there.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nBefore you do, another comment was made at the table here that if there is deflation or disinflation, we've got a $450 to 500 million dollar LIFO reserve that'll be, on a reported basis, it'll be part of a tailwind of that disinflation.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nHey, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. I don't think we've talked a lot about it, but what's competition like out there now that we're seeing inflation come down and volumes, particularly for some guys, are negative? Just wondering what it looks like out there.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI think, look, we've said this for a few years now. Our competition with Sam's is the most direct. We've seen improvements in parts of what they do from our perspective. They're tough competitors, and so are we. But I think they've continued to improve over time, as have we. We don't really see a whole lot of other things. BJ's, while we respect their model and what they do, it's a slightly different model. So there's not as much. There's certainly, when we are competing directly as a membership warehouse club, we're making sure we're sharp on pricing, particularly in fresh and things like that, supermarket items. Beyond that, yeah, our view is on the non-food side, we're gaining share, as evidenced by the numbers we see in some of these NPD results.\nThe thing that I just called out on appliances and things like that, recognizing appliances as, whatever, a $30 billion business, we're still a small piece of it, but growing rapidly.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nThanks. And then I know it came up earlier about raising membership rates, but I kind of feel philosophical. This recession, not recession, maybe there will be one. How does the company look at raising the membership fee if the economy's slow and fast? Does it matter? Does it factor in?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI think it matters. It does matter. And I think it really mattered as we approached kind of the five and a half years post-June of 2017. We were in the headlines every day with inflation and economy. And so we're doing great. We've got great loyalty. If we wait a little longer, so be it. And that's kind of how we feel right now, so.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, R5 Capital\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. I'll yield.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good evening, Richard. So your core and core margins were up a lot in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I think you mentioned food and sundries. Is that successful vendor-funded promotions? Is there anything one-time in nature about that gain that we shouldn't extrapolate forward?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Well, aside from LIFO, markdowns were a lot less. I think core and core, so no markdowns was a big piece of it, particularly on the non-food side. That helped. Last year, we had it was a year ago that all of us, including Costco, I think our inventories on a year-over-year basis were up 26% for two quarters in a row. And of course, those have all come down. And so that was probably the biggest single thing in those numbers. Yeah. A comment that was made at the table here. We're back on track on seasonal in and out dates, so a year, year and a half ago where certain seasonal items came in late. And just to move them out, not to have to store them as much.\nSome we did store, but to move them out where we felt that was the best way to do it, we took extra markdowns. So that helped.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThen a follow-up question around the consumer. You just came through the back-to-school season. There are some important electronics categories that are a big part of the basket during that time of year that also become a big part of the basket around holiday. Are you seeing iPads, PCs, and notebooks? Are you seeing positive unit trends? How does it make you feel about the upcoming holiday season?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale",
    "content2": "Gaming is up. Some of the Apple products are up. TV units are up. But again, the average price points have come down some. Tablets are up, and audio is up a little.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nBut not notebooks and computers?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nNo. Less down was the answer I got.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nSo Richard, first thing, maybe just talk about how you look at cannibalization versus expanding the market in the US, right? And obviously, you can now put, it looks like, locations closer together. When you kind of look at the US in total, is there a number, right, that you guys have in mind that's now possible given what you're doing with density?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Yeah. Our view is over the next 10 years that we could add easily another 150. And that's on top of however many business centers fall in your needs, but just in the US. And that number keeps changing. If you had asked me six, eight years ago where we'd be today, I would say if we were 70/30 US back then, we'd be 50/50 by now. Outside of the country, we'd be 50. And today, we're 65 to 70 in the US still. So we're finding more opportunities here. And it's evidenced by just the sheer volumes of the units that our units are doing today versus three or four years ago. It's much higher than we would have expected three or four years ago. So we think that there's still a lot of runway in that regard.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nThen just quick follow-up. I know you guys haven't been particularly interested in BOPUS, right, for cost reasons. I assume that's still the case. There's a consumer argument for it, but I think it's hard to make the cost side of it work. Is that still your view?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThat is still our view overall. In addition to the thing I mentioned a little bit with what we're doing with Instacart on some non-food items as well, we are testing in-store some big-ticket items like TVs, but on a limited basis to see what happens for buy online and pick up in store.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the CPG guys. Are they funding promotions a little more regularly with you guys? I know you did something, I think, with P&G that seemed like a clever promotion to get a gift card back from them, it seemed. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the other vendors.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. With the P&G thing, actually, we did that last year as well. We've done it for a couple of years. And we will say we did it again. It's growing. So yeah. And once we do that with one, we want to share that excitement with others to see what other types of things we can drive that way. So yeah, I'd say there's probably a little bit more increase on that type of promotional things.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nAnd invent.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nInventory available for those things. We could really drive sales of those items in a short period of time.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nRight. That makes sense. Yeah. The volume that you guys do. And then are you guys approaching the holiday any different this year? I know you mentioned Christmas goods are off to a good start, but is that earlier than normal? I feel like you're about the same timing, but maybe you could share thoughts on the approach to the holiday season.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nIf it's earlier, it's a week or two earlier. And some things came in early. And yeah. Yeah. It's a little early compared to some of the supply chain disruptions we had, which screwed up a lot of things. But if you go back to where we were before COVID, we're probably at or very slightly earlier. And in terms of how we're approaching it, we're approaching it aggressively in terms of having stuff to sell at the number. But we want to be out too. Typically, this is nothing different here. Even on things like toys, we'll bring in a few things in the last couple of weeks before Christmas that if they don't sell through, we're not at risk of having to mark them down dramatically because they're not unique just to Christmas.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nUnderstood. Understood. No, that's great. No, thanks, guys. And good luck this quarter, Richard.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nWell, thank you, everyone. We're around to answer questions. Have a good holiday, and we'll talk to you soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be. A question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question again, press star one. Thank you. Richard Galanti, CFO. You may begin your conference.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nThank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.\nThe risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the 12 weeks ended 7 May 2023.\nReported net income for the quarter was $1.30 billion or $2.93 per diluted share. This compared to $1.35 billion or $3.04 per diluted share a year ago. In the third quarter, this year's results included a non-recurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per share, primarily for the discontinuation shipping activities.\nLast year's results included a non-recurring $77 million pre-tax charge or $0.13 per share for incremental employee benefits. As many of you know, two years ago we initially leased three ships and thousands of containers to help mitigate some of the significant overseas freight challenges that we were experiencing. Later we added four additional vessels and several thousand additional containers with commitments made for up to more than three additional years.\nProcuring these ships and containers was integral to us being able to stay in stock for our members during those challenging times. It also allowed us to do so initially at a lower cost than the market rates at that time. Shipping and freight markets have improved dramatically since that time, which led us to reevaluate our position. As you recall, in.\nfiscal first quarter of this fiscal year, we took a charge to downsize by two vessels our charter shipping activities. Since then, shipping and container rates have continued to fall, and in the third quarter, we concluded that would be appropriate to completely discontinue the remainder of our charter shipping activities.\nAs a result of this decision, we recorded an impairment charge for all remaining charter assets. This decision allows our merchandising teams to take full advantage of the current shipping market rates as opposed to much higher contracted charter rates. In turn, this allows us to do what we do best and lower prices for our members. In terms of sales, net sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% to $52.6 billion versus $51.61 billion reported last year in the third quarter.\nComparable sales for the quarter were as follows: in the US, on a reported basis -0.1%, and excluding gas deflation and fx +1.8%; Canada reported -1.0%, ex gas and fx +7.4%; and other international reported +4.1%, and ex gas and fx +8.4%. So total company on a reported basis, 0.3% comp sales, and ex gas deflation and fx at +3.5%. Now e-commerce on a reported basis was -10.0%, and -9.0% excluding.\nIn terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency remains pretty good, increasing 4.8% worldwide and 3.5% in the US during the quarter. Our average daily transaction or ticket was down 4.2% worldwide and down 3.5% in the US, impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket non foods discretionary items.\nForeign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.5%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.7%. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. For the quarter we reported $1,044 million of membership fee income or 1.98% of sales compared to $984 million or 1.91% a year ago in Q3. So a $60 million or 6.1% increase in membership fees excluding the headwinds in FX. The $60 million increase would have been higher by $17 million or up year over year 8% adjusted for FX.\nIn terms of renewal rates at Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.6% and our worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. These figures are the same all-time high renewal rates that were achieved.\nIn the second quarter just 12 weeks earlier. Membership growth continues. We ended Q3 with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders, both up approximately 7% versus a year ago. At third quarter end, we had 31.3 million paid executive members, an increase of 681,000 or 57,000 per week during the 12 week fiscal third quarter.\nExecutive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year on a reported basis by 13 basis points, coming in at 10.32% as compared to a 10.19% number a year earlier. The 13 basis point positive ex gas deflation was minus 3 basis points.\nBoth of these numbers, of course, include the little more than 50 basis points impairment charge to margin mentioned in today's earnings release. As I normally do, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers: two columns, a reported column and then the column excluding gas deflation. The first item would be for Q3 2023 core merchandise margin.\nOn a reported basis, it was up year over year 39 basis points, and ex-gas deflation up 24 basis points: ancillary and other +13 and +9.2%, rewards -11 and -9, LIFO +25 and +25, and other -53 and -52. If you add up the two columns again, you get to the reported number. On a reported basis, gross margin year over year in the quarter was up 13 basis points, and ex-gas deflation down 3 basis points.\nStarting with the core, again, core was up on a reported basis 39 basis points year over year and 24 ex gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own core sales or core margins, they were higher by 17 basis points. With food and sundries, and non foods being up, and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 13 and again higher by 9 ex gas deflation.\nWithin the ancillary businesses, gas, business centers, food court, and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com 2% reward. Again, higher by 11 basis points and higher by 9 ex gas deflation. Higher sales penetration coming from our executive members is certainly part of that LIFO +25 basis points year over year both with and without gas deflation.\nAs you recall, a year ago in the third quarter we had $130 million charge for LIFO. In this fiscal year we had no LIFO charge. So, $130 billion year-over-year improvement on that line item. Note also that in the fourth quarter a year ago we had a $223 million LIFO charge, so we'll see how that goes in the fourth quarter this year.\nOther was lower by 53 basis points reported and 52x gas deflation. This was net of items from both years. This year there was a 57 basis point negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge, again primarily related to terminating our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by lapping last year's $77 million charge for increment benefits, of which $20 million or 4 basis points related to gross margin. The remaining $57 million.\nI'll talk about it in a minute under SG&A, moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A this year was 9.11% compared to 8.62% a year ago. So on a reported basis, higher by 49 basis points, and ex-gas deflation, higher by 34. As with gross margin, I'll ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, both reported and one with excluding gas deflation.\nFirst item is operations: minus 48 basis points or higher by 48 basis points, and minus 35 basis points; central: minus 11 and minus 9; stock compensation: 0 in both columns; preopening: minus 1 and minus 1; other: plus 11 and plus 11. If you add all those up, again on a basis, 49 basis points higher year over year, and ex-gas deflation, 34.\nNow, the core operations this negative included, of course, the impact of slower sales growth as well as the impact of a few of the wage increases that we did that are typically out of the normal cycle over the last year, over a year, and that included the impact of four weeks of wage and benefits increases implemented last March.\nThe additional top of scale increase that went into effect July 4, and 8 weeks of this March is higher than normal top of scale increase. Despite, again, despite the slowing sales growth, we've continued to invest in our employees over the past year, and that's always been a priority for us. SG&A higher by 11 and higher by 9 ex gas inflation again sales growth.\nNo big single item was an outlier there, but sales growth overall in my view was the impact. Stock comp flat both with and without gas inflation. So no impact there. Preopening again higher by one basis point. We had five openings this year and in the quarter and three last year, but again one basis point delta year over year, and other, the 11 basis points positive both with and without gas deflation.\nThis is a result of lapping that $77 million charge, but within SG and a lapping $57 million of that $77 million charge for the incremental employee benefits. Again discussed earlier in the release. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $36 million, a million dollars over last year's $35 million, and interest income or other for the quarter was higher by $57 million year over year.\nThis was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and cash balances, and interest increase in interest income was partially offset by less favorable FX versus last year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 26.5%. That compared to 24.9% in Q3 last year.\nThe Fiscal 2023 effective rate excluding discrete items is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, reported net income was down year over year by 4 percentage points net. Of the two non-recurring items in both years' third quarters, net income would have been up 8% even with being reflective of that higher income tax rate. In terms of warehouse expansion to date, we've opened 17 locations in the first three quarters and, also including, three relocations.\nSo net of that 14 net new locations in Q4, we have nine new openings with no reloads, so a net of nine. That'll put us at 26 openings less than three relos to be a 23 net new for this year. In the quarter, again we opened five with one with four being net new.\nIn addition to the relocation in Canada, we had two new buildings in the US open and one additional building opened in Japan. In each of Japan and China, we have again of the nine new buildings planned for our fiscal fourth quarter, that includes our North Tulsa, Oklahoma opening that opened this morning and our fourth and fifth buildings in China planned for June and August. These Q4 planned openings will bring our full year count to 26.\nLess than three are at that of 2023, and that is made up of 13 in the US and 10 outside of the US. Regarding capital expenditures in Q3 of the fiscal year, we spent approximately $819 million. Our estimate for all of Fiscal 2023 CAPEX is approximately $4 billion. Moving on to e-commerce, you saw in the release that e-commerce was a -10% sales decline on a comp basis, an FX -9% e-comm sales.\nMore of the same story in terms of the sales as I discussed second quarter call and in our monthly sales recordings in Q3; big ticket discretionary departments, notably Majors, Home and Furnishings, Small Electrics, Jewelry, and Hardware, were down about 20% in e-commerce and made up 55% of e-commerce sales.\nThese same departments were down about 17% in warehouse, but they only make up 8% of warehouse in warehouse sales.\nA few comments on inflation. Inflation continues to abate somewhat. You go back a year ago to Q4 2020 last summer. We had estimated the time that year over year inflation at the time was up 8% and by Q1 and Q2 it was down to 6% and 7% and then 5% and 6%. This quarter we're estimating that year over year inflation in the 3% to 4% range.\nWe continue to see improvements in many items, notably food items like nuts, eggs, and meat, as well as items that include as part of their components commodities like steel and resins on the non food side. Switching over to inventory levels, inventories overall are in pretty good shape as of quarter end. Our inventories year over year as of the end of the third quarter were down 7%.\nRecall that they had been up during some of the supply chain challenges of last year. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday, 28 May 2023, next Thursday, 1 June 2023, after market close. Also remember that our fiscal fourth quarter has an extra week this year. Our quarter ending 3 September 2023 will have 17 weeks versus 16 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. With that, we'll open it up for questions and answers and turn it back over to Josh.Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nReminder, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Good afternoon. Richard, how broadly and widely is Costco willing to roll back prices in order to drive traffic and sustain a mid single digit comp growth? How are you thinking about the prospect of deflation across your entire portfolio? Thank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, look, that's something that our merchants work on literally every day and every week. I remember when inflation was peaking at 8% to 9% and some out there would say, and we're known for trying to hold the line, work with our suppliers, how much will they eat of that? How much will we eat of that at the end of the day?\nIf margins year over year were down 50 or 100 basis points back then, that implies that some portion of it maybe instead of an 8% or 9% increase, our members were seeing a 6% or 7% or 8% increase. Whatever that was, we felt that we were doing as good a job as anyone out there in terms given the item nature of our business to lower prices for our members and hopefully drive sales.\nCertainly, right now we've always been a little bit, compared to others, over-indexed and bigger-ticket discretionary items. That's getting hit arguably more than others. If you look at our fresh foods, food, and sundries.\nThey're in the mid- to mid-high singles. You look at the non-foods and some of the ancillaries, notably gasoline, which is 11% year over year, deflation in gas prices, that's in the mid-single negative. So it all adds up to where it is. Every day we look to drive sales. What will it take to get to whatever X is? Who the heck knows? I just know that our merchants and Craig and Ron and Claudine, our head of merchandising, are pushing the buyers each day to do that and figuring out how can we take the monies that we get.\nAny types of monies from the vendors that can usually use to drive business. One of the reasons that it made sense for us to discontinue.\nThe containers and the shipping, the vessels, is to reduce the cost that our buyers are seeing relative to these higher, much higher contract rates. Now we were smart for a year, and now looking back, it was good to get out of it, and that allow us to be more competitive as well.\nSo I feel we're doing a great job of being very competitive when we do comp shops against our direct warehouse club competitors as well as different components, whether it's retail food or general merchandise. On the buildings home improvement side, we feel very good about our competitive position and what we're doing to do that.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo are you not expecting broad-based deflation, Richard? And my follow-up question is going to be, given the amount of value you give to your members, wouldn't it make sense to raise your fees right now so that you could, because your renewal rates have been so high and you would be providing even more value in this fiscal economic environment.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, first of all, on the question of deflation, let's hope that there is and.\nYou'll be the first to see it at Costco, in my view, as it relates to membership fees. Nice try, Michael, but at the end of the day, with the headline being inflation, we feel very good about if we want to do it, can we do it without impacting, in any meaningful way, renewal rates, signups, or anything. And at some point we will. But our view right now is that we've got enough levers out there to drive business, and we feel that it's incumbent upon us to be that beacon of light to our members in terms of holding them for right now, it's not a matter of big time, but we'll let you know as soon as we know.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Richard, my first question is on the comps and the stacks. It's obviously been slowing, and you probably took more than your fair share over the last three years. Curious when you sit around how you're diagnosing it. Macro. I don't know if it's gas attachment, merchandising, weather, or any of those options. How do you diagnose what's happening?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYeah, well, first of all, we look at traffic. We're getting people in the door, and we know what they're buying. They're buying, you know, non-discretionary items. They're buying fresh foods, they're buying food and sundries. They're buying apparel in a big way. They're buying patio furniture now that the weather's turned in a big way. Indoor furniture, not as much. We all know what's going on with consumer electronics out there. While all the numbers industry-wide are down, ours are down a little less, but they're down. So overall.\nWhen we look at what else can we do to drive more non-food business, but at the same time, can we bring in a few more items on the food and sundry side because we know traffic is good there. Simple impulse items that sell for $15 to $25. So that's what we do every day. And that's what Claudine and her staff merchants are doing.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThen my follow-up, can you give us some information or color on gasoline gross profit year over year, how that profit pool is trending, obviously inclusive of both gallons and the penny profit?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, yeah, gallons are close to flat. The average price per gallon during the quarter was down 11%. So that's 12 or 13% of our sales, which was the average price point per sell unit, if you will, was down 11%.\nYear over year. Gas line was profitable in both quarters nicely, as I've said. I think, I'm sure I said last year in Q3 and this year it helped. It didn't help a little. It helped a little year over year, but not a lot.\nLast year in Q4, it was a strong number. You got an extra week.\nAnd. We'll see how it goes this year. But right now, gasoline continues to be quite profitable for us.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thanks, Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Christopher Horbers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning. So I just want to jump back to the pricing question from a strategy perspective. Typically, if you see things that are disinflating or deflating on the commodity side, you'll take price ahead of that, I guess. Is that what you're doing currently? And you know, we've heard a lot of talk in the market about the vendors funding more promotions. How are you thinking about the balance between the retailer funding the promotion or the price investment versus the vendors?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, first look, we work with our suppliers every day and it's got to be a partnership there. Again, I think it's easier for us on the one hand that we do a lot of volume on a fewer items we're managing. We have buyers that literally are managing a couple of dozen items, not 200 items. And I remember when certain commodity prices like resins and steel were going up, in our monthly budget meeting here from the merchants, how well we're committing out five, six months for seasonal items like patio furniture and barbecue grills a couple years ago.\nWe want to know when the vendor was increasing the price on whatever it was, whether it was a major consumer products company or some manufacturer of non-food items like that. Why? Exactly why? How much of it's labor, how much of it's the commodity cost, and then how much does the transportation cost?\nAnd then as prices work and wage pressure, whatever. And as we saw commodities coming down, I think I'd like to think that we were the first on the phone with those suppliers, getting wanting to know when the price is going to drop. And understandably, in some cases, the supplier had committed to a season of three or four months. And so there was some delay, and we work with them in there. In addition, as we said, we're going to invest a little in price.\nHow much are you willing to invest in price? So it's a partnership, and I think we are better positioned to do that simply because if you take our $230 or 40 billion in sales and divided by 3,800 SKUs, it's a lot more pricing power per SKU and a lot more focus on an item by item basis. So that's what we do.\nAnd as there are promotional monies out there from suppliers, this goes back to the beginning of time around here. I remember with the old traditional co op advertising dollars, a supplier wanted you to spend $0.05 of our own money and add it to $0.05 of theirs to do $0.10 of advertising of their product, and we said just give us the $0.05 and we'll base it on a $0.95 cost, not a $1 cost.\nThat's what we still do. So I think.\nWe have to be smart about knowing what every bucket of money is out there, whether it's promotional monies or ad monies or.\nAdd monies online now and work with our suppliers to do that. In our case, we also do what we call the MVM, the multi-vendor mailers, the coupon booklets that we send out 11 times a year. Not only that, but hot buys in store and what we call temporary price discounts and what can drive sales.\nThe other part of that is when we get monies in some cases, how much elasticity is there in driving business by lowering their price? In some categories, particularly some of the bigger ticket categories, right now there's not an appetite by the consumer necessarily for that. So how do we add value to the item or do more things to it to drive business?\nIt's all o-f the above.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nAs you look forward, you said, I think 3 to 4% inflation in the quarter. You look at the Nielsen data that. Was low double-digit.Walmart talked about that. Two-part question. One is, is the difference just mix that you have more fresh commodity exposure? And then, if you project forward that you'll have no inflation potentially six, eight months out, how do you think about your ability to continue to comp overall?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, when there was low inflation and not an overarching concern about a recession, when the world seemed to be comping three, four, five, and six years ago at 2% to 4%, we were 5% to 7%. Our view is because we got great members buying more with great loyalty and the best prices by a major difference in quality.\nAnd so we've succeeded under those. I think right now, more of it, in my view, more of it relates to the fact that we're not only dealing with big-ticket discretionary items weakness, which again, when we look at like MBD and everything, we're doing better in most of those categories. Our negative is not as negative as others out there. In addition, we're comparing against two years of outsized growth in some of those things.\nAs people were buying things from their home, we saw outsized sales in indoor and outdoor furniture, electronics, TVs, and exercise equipment. And so we're not only comping, comparing against this quote unquote recession or concerns about big ticket items, but comparing against uber strength over the last two years prior to that.\nSo I think we'll come out of this fine. We're pretty good at figuring out new items and new things to do. And you know, we're not just focused on how do we drive sales another 1 or 2%, but how can we drive sales? We're bringing in new and exciting stuff, and we continue to do that. This is anecdotal, but over the last year, year and a half, we've always been very good at taking what I'll call big American Costco products, including a lot of Ks, and having huge success overseas.\nWe're now on a conscious basis figure out what unique, exciting overseas items can we bring elsewhere in the world, including the US and Canada. And we're having good experience with some of those things. These are all small things, but there's lots of little small things around here that add up.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Richard, I think you mentioned fresh foods were a bit on the softer side. You know, when you kind of look at the data, is that a function of your members moving to less expensive packaged goods or is that more just due to the COVID-driven comparisons like you were just talking about on the discretionary side?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYeah. By the way, when I was talking earlier about how the margins were a little weaker on fresh, sales have been fine in the quarter. Again, when you look at a reported total company sales number of 0.3% or 3.5x gas and FX. But within that 0.3% reported.\nFresh was mid singles. Food and sundries is mid to high singles. Non foods was a little over mid single negative.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. All right. I'm not sure I said that. So the second question related to that though is, are you seeing any other kind of trade, let's call it trade down type activity, whether it's more private label sales, et cetera, that you can identify from your members? Thanks.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYeah. And by the way, not just in this current quote unquote recession or concern for recession, historically, we've always seen some like within fresh protein, we've always seen when there's a recession, whether it was 1999-2000 or 2008-09-10, we would see some sales penetration shift from beef to poultry, and pork.\nWe have seen some of that. Now, I think anecdotally, I heard a few months ago from our head of food and sundries buyer that we saw some switch even to some canned products like canned chicken, canned tuna, and things like that. But on the KS side, we've also seen that. I think last quarter I mentioned that on a year over year basis where there was 150 basis points increase in private label sales penetration, and this year at the end of the quarter is 120 basis points. So still.\nOver a full percentage point delta in sales penetration. If you go back over the last 10 years, my guess is that on a year-over-year basis, maybe we've gone from, I'm guessing, 22 or 3 to 25 or 6%. So call it 300 basis points over 10 years or 8 years. So, you know, 30 to 50 basis points versus 120 and 150 in the last couple of quarters. So yeah, that would again at least anecdotally suggest that we've seen people looking for better bargains. We try to correct people when they said it was.\nDowngrading because in our view it was an upgrade when they went to Kirkland Signature.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, thanks very much. Good to talk to you. Two questions. One is your pre-tax margin is one of the highest that I think I seen in the model. Like, I'm not even sure I could go back to when it was as high as it was. So, I'm curious if you could just make some color or commentary on that. And then the second question I had was, not that we're necessarily going into a deflationary environment in food, but if we were to go into a deflationary environment in food, what would be the deleverage you would see on the EBIT line on that front?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, I'd be remiss if I even could think of a number off the top of my head here.\nIn our view, first of all, deflation will be the first out there lowering prices with it. And I'd like to think that we could drive business with it. The other thing is, look at even something like gasoline. I think all retailers out there that have gasoline operations have, in the last few years, reflected higher profitability from gas. In our view, we have higher profitability and we're still, we have the most extreme savings versus everybody else.\nSo we've been able to make a little more per gallon because others have decided to make more than a little more. And I think that same thing holds true elsewhere when we look at our competitive price shops against our direct club competitors and against others on key items like fresh with supermarkets. Again, those price gaps between us and our competition have not changed.\nThey're still as strong as we feel that they should be. So again, it's hard to say what your comment about some of the highest pre-tax margins. Let's face it, I remember looking at even like SG&A which was up year over year. Of course, if you go back.\nPre-COVID, I think our SG&A on a reported basis had a 10 in front of it. It was like 10.1% or 10.0%, and we ever could even get below 10%. With COVID and crazy sales for two years, we benefited, of course, more than we were detrimented by COVID in many of our categories, and we got down below 9%, and, of course, normalized. It's still better than it was, and margins are still better than they were.\nSo I think some of it is sustainable. You know, wages are not going to go down. The question is, will they continue to go up again? We're going to be ahead of that too in terms of wanting to make sure we take care of our employees.\nBut let's assume that a big chunk of that is if overall inflation subsides a little bit. I think we'll see a little less wage pressure. But look, as you know, Karen, with us it's top line sales mostly, and the biggest thing can affect anything. I think we've shown that even with some lesser top line sales, we've been able to pull the levers in a way that still allows us to drive bottom line. And we'll continue to be pragmatic about it, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nSorry, just to follow up on that. So is there any way to frame what ex-gas ex-gas margins, ex-fuel prices, like what delta in sales would result in a delta in EBIT? Is there any way?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, it's hard to say, not really. I mean we used to look at almost like the old Y equals NX plus B model, you know, based on incremental sales. What's the variable rate of expenses in a warehouse? Our collective view, this goes back several years, but our collective view was is you needed somewhere around four and a half, whether it was four or five of a comp number to have flat SG&A or flat expenses at the warehouse.\nYou know, certainly taking the weakness right now in big ticket items and then taking the weakness of gas deflation, those things impact that SG&A percentage more than anything.\nWhen I look every month at our budget meetings, when the operators report on labor productivity as an example in fresh, we're still improving in the 3% to 6% labor productivity in pounds of protein processing, pork, poultry, and meat through the system. When we look at front end labor.\nWarehouse labor, not the ancillary businesses, or the fresh foods, or anything but labor hours. We've shown labor productivity now in the last year.\nWith slowing of sales and with three unusual additional wage increases, that's going to still show a labor percent number higher as a percent of sales, which is our single biggest SG&A item, bigger than other things. But look, at the end of the day, we're still a top line company in our view that will amend all things we'd like to see. I'm sure we'd like to see something pre-inflation back in the 5 to 7 or 8 range. But let's get from where we are now to 3 and 4, and we'll go from there.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay, understood.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, this is the second quarter that we've seen that discussion of lower sales of big ticket discretionary items. It started actually, I think, a little bit in the quarter prior to that. Not the entire quarter, just a little bit in there. So if you will, if all things being equal, we'd be comparing against easier compares six months from.Now.\nBut hopefully we can do a little on our own as well.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nNo, that makes sense. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nSo Richard, core on core food and sundries and non-food were up. Right. So it was kind of a two-part on core and core one. What drove that was that, predominantly mix. And then, secondly, fresh food was down.\nWhere is fresh food versus 19, and are we kind of getting to the.\nPoint where that erosion is going to stop? Right. Because we're pretty close to 19.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYeah. Look, fresh foods is still up year over year on margins. No.\nVersus 19.\nVersus 19.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nRight.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nFresh foods margins are up versus 2019.\nIt went way up. I mean, I think. Hold on a minute. I had a little cheat sheet.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nYeah.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nIf I look back at just fresh foods, if I go back to 2021, we had a couple of quarters where fresh foods margins were up 2 and 300 percentage, 2 and 300 basis points year over year in the quarter by the end of 2021. This is near the end of the kind of the.\nThis is lapping that craziness, that crazy goodness. We were down 190 basis points, and for all of 2022 we were down anywhere from 50 to 120 basis points on a year over year basis. Some of that compared to those plus 2 and 300 basis point numbers, this year we're down again versus last year and down, but down versus that giant increase in fiscal 2021. When I look at where our food gross margin is today in Q3 versus pre-COVID, we're still up.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nOkay.The other categories that were up, right? Is that predominantly mix, private brand, and less big ticket?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYeah, I think it's mixed like some of the non food strength. As I mentioned, I threw out apparel as one of them. Apparel has a strong margin. Apparel has a strong margin relative to all of our departments anyway.\nMajors has a weak margin generally anyway. Of course, lower penetration of that.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nAll right.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nBy the way, freight has helped too, particularly on big ticket items that, you know, the furniture, the white goods, exercise equipment, things like that.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThen secondly, you know, where are we on the personalization journey? Right. Because I know you've done more data analytics in the last couple of years, you've got the loyalty program. Right. When you think about wallet share and targeting, promotions and emails and so. Forth, it looks like a huge opportunity. Where are we on that?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nSure. By the way, one other question that we've gotten a couple of times of late because of some of the companies out there that reported much higher shrink. Our shrink is intact. We haven't seen any major change in shrinkage. You know, it fluctuated a couple 3 basis points up really before COVID as we rolled out self checkout.\nSince then it's come back down a little bit, and it's been a very tight range. We've been fortunate in that regard in terms of where we are in personalization. For those of you on the call that have known me forever, it was probably four years ago that we talked about sometime soon we'll do targeting, and after that do personalization.\nWell, we're still in the early innings, but I guess what I'd like to tell you, and I think I mentioned this on the last quarter's call. Just under a year ago we hired a new VP of Digital Digital Transformation, if you will, both in Ecom and mobile sites and applications that complemented three other outside VPs we hired, one of which was in the data analytics area. We've really over the last six to nine months began a two year roadmap to improve and replatform our primary e-commerce website.\nThe same goes for our mobile apps and mobile site, working, of course, again with data analytics people, the architect people, as well as the business users. We're currently building and dramatically increasing the number of engineering capabilities that we have, and we're on our way. I'd say we're in the early innings, first order business to have, you know, which we now we feel we've gotten to a much better, you know, clean data site.\nWe're still sending you too many emails a week that don't pertain specifically to what you do. I think you're going to see incremental changes, and I'll be able to hopefully report more on that at the next quarterly call. In the last three months, as an example, we've had three small releases to our mobile app that are improvements of it.\nWe're now on plans to have small improvements in that app each month for the several months going forward. You really, as you know, you've heard me say for the past couple years that we're in the early innings. I'll repeat that we are. We actually got, I think, a good game plan, and you'll see more to that over the future, a little longer than we had hoped to do some of this stuff.\nI think we're on our way in that regard.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi Richard, when you think about household income, what kind of trends are you seeing in terms of your customers and people trading in and out of Costco at large? The big ticket item question, what are your thoughts on how you're planning inventories there, the compares ease. Do you expect improvement within big ticket, any color in terms of how that may proceed sequentially?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nThanks. Our annual household income has actually gone up a little. I think that's more to do with wage increases than anything. We still over index to higher end people, higher end income people, and so that's still there. As it relates to our inventories, you know, again, if you had asked me six months ago when in fact it was, I think it was Q.\nQ4 in Q1 where year over year inventories were up 26%, as was our competitors, everybody else. A lot of that had to do with, one, some people had enough big ticket items, but also just the terrible supply chain challenges that we all had. Since then, like others, we've shown a reduction in that dramatically. That's good.\nWe feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Some of you have noted and called us on back again, six, five, four, three months ago we had a lot of promotional things going on. If you bought $3,000 or more of these 10 items, and they were all like, you know, different patio items or different in store furniture items. You know, if you did $3,000 or more, you got a $500 cash card on already great pricing.\nThat was a lot of our promotional money, markdown money to get our inventories back in line, particularly on things where we were over inventory because of supply chain delays. On some examples, I think air conditioners might be an example because of the supply chain last summer, we did great in selling through fans and air conditioners.\nThese are not exact numbers, but let's say we plan to sell $500 million of it, easily 20% to 25% of it got here after the summer because of supply chain challenges. There is no need to mark those down to try to get rid of them. In September, October we held them, and we're selling through them now. That's not an issue at all.\nIn talking to Claudine Adamo, our head of merchandising, and her non food people, we feel pretty good about where we are both on existing inventory levels of what we have in there, as well as what we've committed to going forward for upcoming seasons, notably back to school, Christmas, and things like that.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Richard, you've made a lot of great strides in Asia and China and other regions. I'd love just some highlights in terms of what's ahead for the back half there. A second question, in that connected consumer experience between digital and physical, are there evolved thoughts in terms of BOPIS and curbside and what your members want in delivering the ultimate convenience? Thanks.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nSure. Well, first of all, in terms of expansion outside the US, if you look at just even this year out of 23, I think it was what, 13 and 10, so 60ish, 60, 65%, 60 in the US, Canada, which I combined as one because it's well saturated. We're still opening a bunch of units there, and it's our oldest areas.\nI see that over the next five years going from 65, 35 or 60, 40 to at least 50, 50, if not trending a little bit towards outside the US and Canada. That again is the same answer I would have given you six, seven years ago for now. I think that's a function of one, having more opportunities every day than we thought we had before in the US and Canada, and there's plenty of opportunities going forward elsewhere.\nI think you're still going to see us open in Korea, Taiwan. A unit is a year on a base of somewhere in the mid to high teens in Japan, more than a unit a year on a base in the low 30s, a unit a year. In Australia, not exactly a year each year, maybe it's one year none and then two. In Australia we've got 14, I believe.\nIn Europe we're dominantly. Most of our units are in the UK where we've gotten the low 30s. We're still going to open one or two a year there, or one a year probably. We've opened a few others. We opened our fourth in Spain, and we now have two in France, and one each in Iceland and Sweden. A little growth there. Certainly in China, I mean, China, the big story this year for us, one of the stories is that we opened our first unit in China three and a half, four years ago, our second a year and a half ago, our third last December, and three more this year.\nWe're going to be at six at the end of this year. This calendar year, I'm sorry, this calendar year, two more this fiscal year, and then one more in the fall. There's certainly more growth there. You know, that's not a lot of growth relative to some companies that try to go in and open 20 somewhere or something. We feel good about how we do that.\nWe think there's plenty on. If you look at the bottom line, if we're opening 23 to 25 a year, we'd like to be a little 25 plus a year for the next five years, and somewhere closer to 30 a year in years six through 10. That would make us feel quite good, and we feel very comfortable that we can do that at this juncture.\nIn terms of curbside, we're not very thrilled about it or maybe a little stubborn about it. You know, we tried it in a few locations a year ago and successfully proved ourselves. We don't like it, and we want you to come in. Now we do have lockers for big ticket nonfood items. Interestingly, when people do that, they come in, and over half of them shop while they're in the location.\nOne of our challenges, which is a good quality problem to have, is our average volume per warehouse has continued to grow way more than we had thought a few years ago. Last year, we had over 150 locations doing over $300 million. I think over 27 or 28 doing over $400 million.\nWe've had to open more units. We continue to look at a lot of places even in the US, and we don't get a lot of ask for it. Honestly, now we're not asking a lot about it either, but we don't get a lot of ask for it. I don't see that being as a big thing.\nOne of the things that we will be doing though is even online, when you go to look at an online product, if we're selling in the warehouse near you, based on where you shopped in the next several months, cross my fingers, you will be able to say you can go ahead and get it in store at the Kirkland at the Issaquah location, which also has it in stock right now. In some cases.\nYeah, same day grocery. You know, of course we already have with delivery, mostly with Instacart. We partner with a couple of other people as well, but they're the big kahuna there, both in the US and Canada. We do two day dry.\nYeah. By the way, that number, which is continuing to grow, is not reported in our income numbers. In that case, their employee or contract employee comes in, shops, rings it up, and takes it to you. That's what we consider a warehouse sale.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Very helpful.Thanks, Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nCEO, R5 Capital\n\nHey, thanks Richard, for taking the question. I wanted to talk about competition a little bit. First, shorter term, and maybe I missed the answer to this or if it was asked, promotional activities now, are they, someone, one of your competitors said they really kind of ramped up. Is that what you're seeing as well?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nYes, it's higher than it was now. Mind you, it was a lot lower for a couple of years because of supply chain challenges. I mean, every TV we could sell, every whatever we could, not particularly on an item, we could sell, every paper good we could sell. We actually took some items out of like the MVM mailers on the sundry side because, one, there were shortages like paper goods. Why promote it when, first of all, we've got to limit one per customer? Some of those comparisons is there's more versus a lot less for a couple of years as well. Yes, we are seeing more now.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nCEO, R5 Capital\n\nIs that purely from the vendors or is that some activities you're seeing from retailers themselves?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, you mean. Well, I can speak for us. Yeah. I mean, certainly when we see something that other retailers are doing, we want to make sure, you know, we ask our supplier. Maybe they can't tell us, but we're putting the pressure on to know that we're seeing some unusual things out there. Lo and behold, sometimes we see better deals the following day to us. We just got to stay on top of that. In terms of, you know, I think.\nAs I said a little earlier, I think we've got a lot of levers to pull. Certainly all retailers that have gas right now have continued to be helped with that. Unusual things like fresh have been relatively strong, and we feel good about that. Even like apparel, which is close to an $8 billion business for us worldwide, seven plus billion dollar business worldwide, that's been strong. That's not promotional, that's just better margins in some cases.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nCEO, R5 Capital\n\nOkay, I wanted to talk. A little bit more long term about competition. It's been a long time. I think that we've seen as many openings from non-Costco people. You are going to see that over the next year, two, three. The other competitors also, they tout their omnichannel and their technology about just scanning it and going. Just give us an overall your view of the competitive environment over the next one to three years, and how Costco fits, and whether you think that some of those technologies and e-commerce stuff are competitive advantages for people that are competing against you\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco",
    "content2": "Well, I think we're fortunate one way that first and foremost the biggest value attribute or customer attraction attribute is the best quality goods at the lowest price. We dwarf everybody in that regard. I mean, our average markup on goods is in the low double digits, you know, 12, 13%, you know what they are at other traditional retailers, anywhere from 25 to 35 to 100%. We have that extreme benefit to start with. Arguably, we've been somewhat simple in our own arrogant way over the years. One of the things we've done, as I mentioned earlier on the question that John I think had on.\nForget about personalization, even target marketing. I view it now as some low-hanging fruit that we're finally going around to do over the next couple of years. That'll be a positive to us relative to others in terms of the benefit of buying online and picking up in store and things like that. We frankly view that as more costly than it is beneficial.\nWe haven't been asked a lot about it other than by analysts who are responding, in fairness, to the different retailers that feel they have to do it. Many of them want to do it, but there's a cost to doing that. We feel pretty good about driving business. We think we can do more, we can certainly do more online.\nWe don't have some strategic goal to go from 8%, which is still a $20 billion business, to go from 8% of sales to 16%, but let's go from 8 to 9, 9 to 10, 10 to 11 over a certain period of time. We think that with some of the things we're doing on that side, we can. I think we've also done an incredible job day in and day out on the merchandising side of bringing in more exciting items.\nThat's something that is focused on, that I hear about at every budget meeting and every Monday morning meeting with Greg and Ron, and a few other senior colleagues, including our merchandising head. I think that's what's going to keep driving our business. I think we are getting better on the technology side, playing from behind a little bit on that.\nI think we finally got a game plan and some people that are helping build those areas up, both from a marketing and advertising standpoint, taking advantage of the advertising dollars that are out there, that we've done pretty well despite ourselves. We know we can do a lot better in grabbing some of those dollars. What we'll use it for is to drive sales.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nCEO, R5 Capital\n\nClub openings. I don't think you touched on that.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nThank you. The big club opening thing is we're on our target. I think the last three years there was a big down year because of the first year of COVID, but fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023, I think we average around 23 net new units a year. In 2022 and 2023, we'd like to get above 25 over each of the next five years and closer to 30 years, 6 through 10. That's kind of the game plan, and that really is a bottom up approach by each of the eight US geographic regions, the two Canadian regions, and every other country region working with operations in our real estate department, kind of.\nWhich oes are likely and what's our priority? We feel pretty comfortable we've got a good.\nA good pipeline of pending openings for sure over the next three or four years, and with an equal level of comfort that we feel that we'll continue to have plenty of opportunities to open units.\n\nScott Mushkin\n\nCEO, R5 Capital\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nBranchi\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nRichard. This is Branchi. I'm on for Paul. I wanted to follow up on what you mentioned about the digital investments that you are making. It sounds like it's something that eventually you might monetize partnering with your vendors. How do you balance that with your view that you really want your members in your warehouse? How do you see that working over the long term?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, first of all, part of that monetizing of digital is in warehouse. We've been very successful of moving the needle, if you will, on a holiday weekend with hot prices on strip steaks or at the beginning of a season with the planting season with.Green items.\nI think it's just we're getting around to doing a better job of it, and we're bringing in people that have done it before, frankly, and that's even in membership marketing. Sandy Torrey, who heads up Senior Vice President of membership marketing, we're doing more things than we're doing. She's doing more things today than we did even a year ago, trying some things. I think that our first order of business is to drive business in store, certainly driving it online as well, but not to just replace what's in store.\nI think, you know, again, I try to stay a little low key on this subject because we're not, I hate to use the word, this new strategic effort, but what we've learned over the last few years is everybody is a technology company today, and there's some things that we have been a little slow to doing, and we know there's a lot of opportunity there to do some of the even basic things, not have. You get five emails a week that none of which relate specifically to you.\nIf it was an email, even just based on a couple of items you purchased in store that had a banner of items that you might be interested in, you could literally double the click rate on them. Those are the kind of things that bringing in of the four, what we call catalyst VP hires in our IT department over the last few years, one is data analytics and one is digital.\nIt's not just two individuals, it's the teams that they have built in short order. We'll continue to do that and tell you more as we go along.\n\nBranchi\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGot it. If I could follow up on the membership side, you mentioned membership marketing. Are you seeing any difference in promotions from your competitors for their memberships? How has that informed what you all are doing? Is there any major change on promotions on membership program members?\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nWell, for us, there's really no change. I mean, we do a few promotional things each year, but the biggest thing we don't do is in any big way discount our membership. Now, some of the promotional things that you may sign up for membership and you get a certain number of coupons related to stuff, but I don't want to go into that.\nYou can look at our competitors and see what they do. There's a lot more promotional activity going on elsewhere, and we're still getting, as I mentioned on the call, a year over year 7% increase in new memberships with about a 3%, just under a 3% increase in number of new warehouses. We're still getting people in the door. I think in fairness that's been helped by Covid.\nWhen we were one of the, we being warehouse clubs, it was a big cavernous place to come and get a lot of things, and that certainly helped us. I'd like to think we're pretty good at what we do, and that's why more people are signing up, and we're opening new units and driving more business that way. Really, we have not done, if anything we've done a little less on the promotional side and membership. We do a few promotional things each year, but not a lot.\n\nBranchi\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nI'm going to take, I'm going to take. I'm going to take one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer and Co.\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In China, I was curious with the reopening there, how those locations are performing versus your expectations.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThey do great, end of story. We've been blessed by those, those first openings that we have over there. Needless to say, we were impacted like everybody over there during the shutdown and what have you. We had some great video clips at our budget meetings here showing what we did to create care packages not only for our members, but for the neighborhoods around us. We were told they were the best care packages of any of the big retailers. That made us feel good.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer and Co.\n\nGreat. Maybe just one follow up question, as you look at your bigger ticket categories, consumer electronics, et cetera, any sense at this point whether trends have bottomed or, you know, just curious if you think trends have bottomed or whether we could see further softening in some of these bigger ticket areas.\n\nRichard Galanti\n\nCFO, Costco\n\nI have one of my colleagues here on the merchandising side, and she was saying to me softly, the negatives are getting better.\nI, it's about seven, seven or eight months ago, seven-ish months ago when we started seeing the decline. If nothing else, we'll be having an easier compare five months hence. Certainly we've seen a little bit of improvement in the negative. Well, thank you, everyone.\nDavid, Josh, and I are around to answer questions if you have any more, which I'm sure you will. Have a good afternoon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions]\nRichard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.\n\nRichard A. Galanti\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Costco Wholesale Corp.\n\nThank you, Emma, and good afternoon to everyone.\nI will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are being made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nIn today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past February 12, as well as February retail sales for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26.\nReported net income for the quarter came in at $1.466 billion or $3.30 per share compared to $1.299 billion or $2.92 per diluted share last year, an increase of 13%.\nIn terms of sales, net sales for the second quarter increased 6.5% to $54.24 billion compared to $50.94 billion reported a year ago in the second quarter. Our comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., 5.7% for the 12-week period, excluding gas inflation, 5.8%; Canada, 3.5% reported and 9.6% excluding gas inflation and FX; Other International, 3.8% reported and 9.5% ex gas inflation and FX; for Total Company, 5.2% reported and 6.8% excluding gas inflation and FX; e-commerce was minus 9.6% for the 12 weeks reported and minus 8.7% excluding FX.\nIn terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5% worldwide and 3.7% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.2% worldwide and up 1.9% in the U.S. during Q2. Foreign currencies relative to the dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.8%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales very slightly by approximately 0.2%. I'll review our February sales results later in the call.\nNext on the income statement is membership fee income. Reported in the second quarter, $1.027 billion of membership fee income or 1.89%. That's for this year's second quarter compared to $967 million a year earlier, so a $60 million increase in dollars or up 6.2%. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by additional $20 million. So on an FX-adjusted basis, fee income was up just over 8 percentage points.\nIn terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, up 0.01% from Q1 end, and worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, also up 0.01% from the prior quarter, both represent all-time highs.\nMembership growth has remained strong. We ended the second quarter with 68.1 million paid household members and 123.0 million cardholders, both up more than 7% versus a year earlier. At Q2 end, we had 30.6 million paid executive memberships. This is an increase during the 12-week quarter of 630,000 members since Q1 end. Executive members now represent 45% of paid members and about 73% of worldwide sales.\nMoving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. On a reported basis, gross margin was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.72% as a percent of sales as compared to a year earlier second quarter at 10.64%. Now the 8 basis points up, and then excluding gas inflation, have been up 9 basis points.\nAs I always ask you to draw a little chart with 2 columns, reported and excluding gas inflation, and then we'll go down the line items. Core merchandise was minus 6 basis points reported and also minus 6 ex gas inflation. Ancillary businesses were plus 2 and plus 3 basis points year-over-year; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, since we had a charge last year and nothing this fiscal quarter, it was plus 14 and plus 14. For total, again, reported, 8 basis points up year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, up 9 basis points.\nStarting with the core. Our core merchandise gross margin again was lower by 6 basis points year-over-year. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margin, if you will, it was lower year-over-year by 26 basis points. Most major departments in general were down, with fresh foods being down a little more than others. We're continuing to hold or drop prices where we can to drive traffic and improve our competitive advantage. Overall, core sales benefited from sales shifting from ancillary and other businesses to core.\nAncillary and other businesses gross margins again were higher by 2 and 3 basis points ex gas in the quarter. Gas business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset in part by e-com and pharmacy. 2% Reward lower by 2 basis points, that's reflective of the higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, as I mentioned, was a year-over-year variance of plus 14 basis points. We had no LIFO charge this fiscal quarter compared to a $71 million charge in Q2 last year.\nMoving on to expenses, SG&A. Our reported SG&A for the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 13 basis points. This year, it was 9.11% compared to 8.98% in the second quarter of last fiscal year.\nJotting down some numbers for the 2 columns, first column being reported; the second, ex gas inflation. Operations was down -- higher, I said, minus 2 basis points -- higher by 2 basis points, so minus 2 and minus 2; central, minus 9 and minus 9, so higher year-over-year in central by 9 basis points; stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2; and then all told, that would be 13 basis points higher, both on a reported basis and ex gas inflation.\nThe core operations component of SG&A, again, higher by 2 basis points and also higher by 2 ex inflation. This includes the wage and benefits increases implemented last March and last year's third fiscal quarter and an additional top-of-scale wage increase that went into effect July 4, which was in our fourth quarter of last year. Central, as I mentioned, was higher by 9 basis points year-over-year. About half of this increase is a charge related to a tax audit covering several prior years. Stock comp pretty much as expected, just a couple of basis points.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, $2 million lower than the $36 million figure in Q2 of last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $89 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates being earned and on higher cash balances. The increase in interest income was slightly offset by unfavorable FX. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.1%, down slightly from the 26.7% figure in Q2 last year. The effective rate for the year, excluding discrete items, continues to be projected in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, net income was up about 13%.\nIn terms of a few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In the second quarter, we opened 3 net new warehouses, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Australia. Additionally, next week, we'll open our third warehouse in China, with our fourth and fifth China new openings scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, so a total of 3 this fiscal year in China. In fiscal '23, we expect to open a total of 27 warehouses, including 3 relocations, so a net increase of 24 new warehouses. These 24 planned new openings are made up of 14 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International. The 10 in Other International includes the 3 in China, along with our first Costcos in each of New Zealand and Sweden, both of which were opened during the fiscal first quarter.\nRegarding capital expenditures, our second quarter fiscal '23 capital spend was approximately $900 million. Our estimate for the year remains in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion based on timing.\nIn terms of e-commerce, as I mentioned, e-commerce sales in Q2, FX decreased 8.7%. This weakness was driven mostly by our online mix of sales. Big-ticket discretionary departments like majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, hardware, these were down 15% in the quarter and make up 58% of our e-com sales. These same departments, by the way, were down 11% in warehouse but only make up 8% of total warehouse in-line sales.\nNow a few comments regarding inflation. It continues to seem to improve somewhat. Recall, back in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended last August, our estimated year-over-year price inflation was 8% for that prior fiscal year. During Q1, the estimate on a year-over-year basis came down to 6% to 7%. In Q2, we estimate that the equivalent year-over-year inflation number has come down to 5% to 6% range and even a little lower than that towards the end of the quarter, according to the buyers. We continue to see some improvements in many items. Commodity prices are starting to fall not back to pre-COVID levels and some examples but continue to provide some relief with things like chicken, bacon, butter, steel, resin, nuts.\nSwitching over to our inventory levels. Again, both in Q3 and Q4 fiscal year-ends in fiscal '22, on a year-over-year basis, our inventories were up 26% year-over-year. And then in our first quarter of this year, they were up 10%, so good improvement there. As of this quarter end, our inventory year-over-year as of the end of Q2 was down 2% year-over-year. Regarding the 2% drop, we were a bit over-inventoried last year as a result of supply chain challenges, causing inventory to be backed up at the ports. And talking to the buyers a year ago, their estimate of just timing of getting things across the ocean was 70-plus days. Today, it's back down to 30-ish days. And so supply chain improvement across the board and rates, of course, coming down.\nNow turning now to our February sales, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. As reported in our release, net sales for the month were $17.06 billion, an increase of 4.7% from $16.29 billion a year earlier in the month of February. Recall from January sales results that the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on January 22 this year, 10 days earlier this year. The shift positively impacted February's Other International by about 2% and Total Company by about 0.25%. Additionally, February's results for both the U.S. and Total Company were negatively impacted by approximately 1%, we estimate, as a result of substantially worse weather this year over year. I believe most of that was on the traffic side rather than ticket side.\nSame-store sales, again in the release, on the U.S., as reported, 3.4%; ex gas, 3.5%; Canada reported, 1.2; ex gas and FX, 7.3%; Other International, 6.5% reported; ex gas and FX, plus 11.5%; Total Company, 3.5% reported; ex-gas and FX was 5.0%; in terms of e-com, minus 11.2% reported compared to a minus 10.3% without FX. That's actually an improvement from our January e-com results.\nOur comp traffic or frequency in February was up 4.9% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada, been impacted by 5.5 percentage points, Other International by approximately 5.7% and Total Company by approximately 1.5%. Gasoline prices were essentially flat year-over-year, ever so slightly inflationary, but essentially flat. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down 1.3%, including the negative impact from FX that I just mentioned.\nIn terms of regional and merchandising categories, general highlights for February that we normally do in this monthly sales call. The U.S. regions with the strongest comp sales were the Midwest, the Northeast and the Southeast. In terms of Other International, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Spain, U.K. and Mexico. Year-over-year inflation for food and sundries and fresh foods, while still elevated, were at their lowest levels in nearly a year, with food and sundries inflation dropping to the high single digits and fresh foods to the low to mid-single digits.\nMoving to merchandise highlights. The following comparable sales results by category for the month excludes the negative impact from foreign exchange. Food and sundries were positive low double digits. Cooler, food and sundries were the strongest. Fresh foods were up mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included bakery and meat. Non-foods were negative mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included tires, health and beauty aids and apparel. Majors, which were electronics and big-ticket electronics items, jewelry, housewares, domestics and small appliances and hardware were the worse performers, consistent with Q2 overall. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-single digits. Food court, hearing aid and pharmacy were the top performers there.\nFinally, in terms of upcoming earnings and sales releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 2, on the following Wednesday, April 5, after market close.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to turn it back over to Emma for questions and answers. Thank you.",

    "content": "Q1 2023 Costco Wholesale Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2023 Costco Wholesale Corp Earnings Call\n\nCOSTNASDAQDEC 8, 5:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Fiscal Q1 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And please be advised that this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Costco's CFO, Richard Galanti. Richard, please go ahead.\n\nRichard A. Galanti\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Bo, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\nIn today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past November 20. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.364 billion or $3.07 per diluted share. That compared to $1.324 billion or $2.98 a share last year. This year's results included a charge of $93 million pretax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities and a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included an asset write-off of $118 million pretax or $0.20 per diluted share and a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation.\nAdditionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in our foreign company earnings translating into fewer U.S. dollars. With 25% to 30% of our earnings generally -- generated outside of the United States, this negatively impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share. In terms of sales, net sales for the first quarter increased 8.1% or $53.44 billion versus $49.42 billion reported last year. On a comparable sales basis during the first quarter, reported U.S. sales increased over the 12 weeks 9.3%, and excluding gas inflation and FX, 6.5%; Canada, 2.4%; reported, 8.3% increase, ex gas inflation and FX. Other International reported minus 3.1%; excluding gas inflation, FX, plus 9.1%. So you have all told, 6.6% reported for the company, and ex gas inflation and FX of 7.1%. E-commerce, by the way, was reported of a minus 3.7% and a minus 2%, excluding FX.\nIn terms of first quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.9% worldwide and up 2.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up 2.6% worldwide and 6.9% U.S. during the first quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 3%, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%.\nMoving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter, membership fee income came in right at $1 billion. That's $54 million or 5.7% higher than last year's reported number of $946 million. Again, the relative weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, excluding the impact of FX, we're assuming flat FX year-over-year, that $54 million number would have been increased by $32 million, and the membership on an adjusted basis would have been a little over 9% year-over-year on flat FX.\nIn terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.5% compared to 92.4% a quarter ago. And worldwide rate came in both at this quarter end and the previous quarter end, the same level at 90.4%. We ended first quarter with 66.9 million paying household members and 120.9 million cardholders, both up 7% versus last year, and recognize we added about 22 units over the course of that last year. So that was about just under 3% of that increase.\nAt Q1 end, paid executive memberships were right at $30 million, an increase of $904,000 during the 12 weeks or $75,000 a week during the first quarter. Executive members now represent 45% of our paid membership and just under 73% of worldwide sales.\nMoving down the income statement to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower by 21 basis points, excluding gas inflation. And as I'll explain in a minute, the 93% pretax charge, excluding that 93% -- $93 million charge we took in the quarter, gross margin, ex gas inflation, would have been only down 3 basis points.\nAs I always ask you, jot down the following numbers, 2 columns and 6 line items. The first column is reported during the first quarter, a year-over-year delta change in basis points, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. On a core merchandise basis, we reported in the first quarter minus 52 basis points, and ex gas inflation, minus 31 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 23 on a reported basis and plus 30; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 5; LIFO, plus 3 and plus 3; Other, that's the $93 million charge, minus 17 and minus 18. So all told, again, a reported basis was 45, ex gas inflation, 21.\nSo starting with the core. Core merchandise's contribution to gross margin on a reported basis was lower by 52 basis points year-over-year and lower by 31 basis points ex gas inflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core or core gross margin, if you will, was also lower by 31 basis points, with food and sundries being up a little bit, offset by nonfoods and fresh foods being down. Fresh foods was down. As you know, for the last couple of years, it's been particularly strong, and it's come down a little bit. In addition, we are looking to hold prices on some of those price points despite inflated costs in some of the fresh food categories.\nAncillary and other business gross margins were higher by 23 and higher by 30 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter, with gas business centers and travel up year-over-year, offset in part by e-com, food courts and optical. Our 2% reward, minus 2 basis points; reported, minus 5%, excluding gas inflation, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members.\nLIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a very small LIFO charge this year, but lapped a $14 million charge in Q1 last year. You recall last year, during the 4 quarters, we had LIFO charges in excess of $400 million pretax with a small amount that $14 million in the first quarter over $100 million in Q3 and over $200 million in Q4. So we'll see what inflation does this year. Hopefully, it will continue to its current trends in the right direction.\nOther, the minus 17 and 18 basis points reported in ex gas inflation. This is the $93 million charge, as mentioned in the earnings release, mostly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Over a year after COVID began, you will recall that the supply chain challenges related to shortages of the containers and shipping delays greatly intensified with container freight and shipping rate skyrocketing. It was in Q4 of 2021 on our earnings call that we mentioned our initial leasing of 3 ships and several thousand containers to help mitigate these challenges. Later, we added 4 additional vessels and additional needed containers with commitments made for up to 3 years.\nOur objectives at the time were twofold: first, to increase the ability for more timely shipping and arrival of overseas merchandise. This allowed us to better stay in stock and drive sales; and second, to reduce some of the skyrocketing shipping and associated container costs. We achieved those objectives for a period of time. Over the course of a year, 1.5 years, we controlled the shipping and delivery of nearly 50,000 containers, many that would have been greatly delayed and at an estimated savings as compared to the then current shipping container costs of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per container. That, of course, fluctuated. Now with a dramatic improvement in shipping times and much lower shipping and container costs, it made sense to downsize our commitment and lower prices for our members.\nMoving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at a 9.20% compared to a year ago of 9.55%. And that plus 35 basis point improvement would be plus 13 basis point improvement, excluding gas inflation.\nAgain, writing down 6 line items and 2 columns. First column being reported, second ex gas inflation. During the first quarter, our core operations was lower or better by 8 basis points, plus 8 then; without gas inflation, minus 9; central, 0 and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 1; preopening, 0 and 0; Other, plus 24 and plus 24; for a total first column reported -- year-over-year reported SG&A plus 35 or lower by 35 basis points and ex gas inflation lower by 13.\nNow going through those numbers, the core operations component of SG&A was again lower by 8 basis points reported, but higher by 9, excluding impact of gas inflation. These results include 3 sets of wage increases that were done in the past year plus as well as a little slower sales results in Q1 as compared to the prior quarter. Still increases, but a little lower than the prior quarter.\nCentral was flat or 0 and higher by 3, ex gas inflation. Stock comp, again, a little lower number in stock comp as a percent, so it came down, improved a little bit. Preopening, no impact. And the other, the 24 basis points you recall last year in Q1, this consisted of an asset write-off totaling $118 million pretax, which impacted the SG&A line last year.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, down $5 million or down from $39 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 11% year-over-year, $53 million versus $42 million a year ago. Interest income was higher year-over-year, offset by unfavorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the quarter was up 4%, coming in at $1.77 billion, compared to $1.696 billion a year ago. And excluding the charges described earlier in both years, pretax income was up around 3%.\nIn terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 23.0% compared to 20.7% of Q1 last year, so a little higher this year. Both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. The fiscal '23 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items -- this discrete item, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%.\nA few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we plan to open a net of 24 units this year, 27 openings, including 3 relocations, so a net of 24. In the first quarter, the net of that 24 included 7. We planned 3 more in Q2, 4 in Q3 and 10 in Q4. In the first quarter, we opened, as I mentioned, 7 net new warehouses, 4 were in the U.S. and 1 each was in Korea, our first in New Zealand and our first in Sweden. Additionally, last week, we opened another building in the U.S. And just yesterday, we opened our 14th location in Australia, our second on the country's West Coast in or near Perth. In fiscal '23, again, 27 total new openings, including 3 locations for a net of 24. Of the net 24, it's made up of 15 in the U.S. and 9 and Other International, including our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding CapEx. In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $1.06 billion. And our estimate for the entire fiscal year is CapEx of somewhere in the $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion range.\nMoving to e-commerce. E-commerce, as we mentioned in the press release, on a reported basis was -- for the quarter, year-over-year sales were minus 3.7 and minus 2, ex FX. Including sales -- what we don't include in this number is our sales through like same-day delivery for fresh food with our partners like Instacart, which we don't include those, and they are fulfilled in our warehouse. Our e-com comps, ex FX, would have been if we included it in the positive low single digits.\nStronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tickets and gift cards, tires, candy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department majors, which includes consumer electronics and appliances, which represents over 40 -- close to 40% to 50% of our -- over 40% of our e-com volume was down in the high single digits. Subsequent to quarter end, we did have our 2 biggest e-com selling days in our company history, both on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nNow a few comments regarding inflation. Recall, we've seen some minor improvements in a few areas. Hopefully, continuing the comment I made last quarter's earnings call, a little light at the end of the tunnel, but it's still little. Recall last quarter and fourth quarter, we estimated that year-over-year price inflation was about 8%. In the first quarter, we estimate the equivalent year-over-year inflation number in the range of 6% to 7%.\nFood and sundries is still up more than nonfoods, but overall, a little better level than a quarter ago for the company. And commodity costs are mostly coming down, whether it's corn flour, sugar and butter or even some things like steel. A few things are up, but overall, we're seeing a little bit of a trend, but we'll keep you posted.\nSwitching over to inventory levels. Recall that our total inventory in both -- at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4 on a year-over-year basis were up 26% year-over-year. I'm happy to report that good progress was made during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our increase as of Q1 end dropped to a 10% year-over-year increase, largely driven by an estimated 6% to 7% inflation and about just under 2% year-over-year unit growth. So inventories, while we still have some pockets of a little over inventory, overall, we feel pretty good about it.\nAs a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 1 on Thursday, January 5, after the market closes.\nWith that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Bo. Thank you.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the call over to CFO, Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard A. Galanti\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Latif, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nIn today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the 16 weeks ended this past August 28. The net income for the quarter was $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share compared to $1.67 billion or $3.76 per diluted share a year ago. Last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by an asset write-off of $84 million pretax or $0.14 per diluted share. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $5.84 billion or $13.14 a share compared to $5.01 billion or $11.27 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $70.76 billion as compared to $61.44 billion reported last year in the fourth quarter.\nOn a comparable sales basis from the fourth quarter, U.S. for the 16-week period on a reported basis had comp sales of 15.8%. When you exclude gas inflation and FX -- we'll won't be any FX, gas inflation, it'd be 9.6%; Canada, 13.4% reported, 13.7% ex gas and FX; Other International, 2.9% reported and 11.3% ex gas and FX. So all told, total company was reported as 13.7%, and excluding gas and FX, plus 10.4%. Separately, e-commerce, 7.1% reported and again, excluding FX, 8.4%.\nIn terms of the Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 7.2% worldwide and up 5.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 6.0% worldwide and up 10.0% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter.\nForeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 2%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 5.5%.\nThe best-performing core categories in the quarter were candy, frozen, kiosks, tire, lawn and garden, jewelry, toys, bakery and deli. In terms of ancillary businesses, the best performers were gas and food courts. And in other businesses, travel and business centers performed best relative to the prior fiscal fourth quarter results.\nGoing down the income statement to membership fee income on a reported basis. Membership fee income came in at $1.327 billion or 1.88%. That was up $93 million or 7.5% on a reported basis, again, with weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. That number, excluding the impact of FX, would have been $29.8 million higher, and the 7.5% reported increase would have been a 10% increase.\nIn terms of renewal rates, we again hit all-time highs. At Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.6%, which is 0.3 percentage point higher from 16 weeks earlier at Q3 end when we were at 92.3%. And our worldwide renewal rate came in at the end of the fiscal year at 90.4%, up 0.4 percentage point from Q3 end when it was 90.0%.\nIn terms of the number of member households and cardholders, at Q4 end, we ended the fourth quarter with 65.8 million paid household members and 118.9 million cardholders, both up 6.5% from a year earlier. And that 6.5% increase in number of members and cardholders is on about -- just under a 3% increase in the number of locations. During the year, we opened 23 locations on a base that began the year with 815 warehouses.\nAt Q4 end, our paid executive memberships totaled 29.1 million, an increase of 1.2 million or 74,000 per week during the 16 weeks since third quarter end. Executive members now represent over 44% of our members and just under 72% of our worldwide sales.\nIn terms of membership fees and a possible increase, there are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time. We're pleased with our growth in both top line sales and membership households over the last several quarters and in member loyalty as reflected in increasing member renewal rates. We'll let you know when something is about to happen.\nMoving on to fourth quarter gross margins. For the quarter, gross margin on a reported basis came in at 10.18% compared -- down 74 basis points from last year's reported gross margin of 10.92%. Now the 74% -- the 74 basis point year-over-year reduction is on a reported basis. Excluding gas inflation, it was minus 22 basis points. And as we normally do, we actually jot down a few numbers, and then we'll elaborate a little bit more on margin. So the 2 columns would be reported year-over-year change, and the second one would be ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change.\nSo the core merchandise margin on a reported basis, minus 67 basis points year-over-year; ex gas inflation, minus 23 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, the second line item, plus 20 and plus 34; our 2% reward, 0 and minus 5; LIFO, minus 27 and minus 28; and all told, total minus 74 reported, as I mentioned, and minus 22 on -- excluding gas inflation basis.\nStarting with the core. Core merchandise's contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year-over-year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales.\nIn terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That's pretty much in line with each of the last 3 quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year-over-year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. So again, for the quarter, it was minus 26 core-on-core.\nAncillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change.\nOur 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down 5 -- lower or down 5 basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members.\nIn terms of LIFO. LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year-over-year -- or higher year-over-year. The LIFO charge this year on an ex gas inflation basis, 28 basis points higher, and that represented $223 million charge in the quarter. Recall that our LIFO charges were relatively small in the first part of the year at $14 million; last quarter, in the third quarter, $130 million; and then as I mentioned here, $223 million for the quarter.\nMoving to SG&A. We showed good results. Reported SG&A came in at 8.53% compared to last year's 9.22% or an improvement of 69 basis points. But again, ex gas inflation, the improvement was still good at 26 basis points lower year-over-year.\nAgain, charting down a few numbers here, charting down the numbers on a core operations basis, on a reported basis, that was plus 50 basis points or positive reduction of 50 improvement; ex gas inflation, plus 12 basis points; central, plus 2 and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 1; preopening expense, plus 1 and plus 2; other, plus 14 and plus 14. That gets you down to again on a reported basis, year-over-year SG&A was improved by 59 basis points; and ex gas inflation by 26 basis points.\nIn terms of the quarter year-over-year, the core operations was, again, better by 12, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind, these results include the starting wage increases we instituted in October of 2021, so in the first quarter of this fiscal year, this past fiscal year as well as new wage and benefits increases implemented during the third quarter in March of this year as well as the impact of 8 weeks in this quarter as we increase the top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4. So a few increases that we've done this year. And still, we feel pretty good SG&A improvement given our sales strength.\nCentral was lower by 2 basis points and higher by 3 ex gas inflation. Nothing big to talk about there. Again, stock compensation I mentioned. Preopening, I've just -- we've noted that since we now include preopening on the income statement as part of SG&A instead of a separate line item. And other, again, the 14 basis points, recall that, that included that last year's write-off in the quarter totaling $84 million. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased 10%, coming in at $2.497 billion. A little of that benefit was that asset write-off last year.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $48 million this year versus $52 million last year, relatively similar. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million year-over-year, coming in at $67 million this year versus $68 million last year. Interest income was actually higher, but that was offset by unfavorable FX impact, which pretty much offset each other to be roughly flat year-over-year.\nOverall, reported pretax income was up 10%, coming in at $2.516 billion this year, up from $2.291 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 26.1% in Q4 last year. The fiscal '23 effective tax rate, we estimate, is currently projected to be approximately 26%.\nNet -- one thing I mentioned why we haven't mentioned in the past, net income attributable to Costco, that line item was up 12%. Recall that on June 30 this past year, we acquired the 45% minority interest from our JV partner in Taiwan. So we now own all of Costco Taiwan. As a result, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was better by $14 million in the quarter. The noncontrolling interest line will become 0 going forward, essentially, a small amount, but pretty much 0.\nA few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. In the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new warehouses. So for the full year, we opened 26 warehouses, but that included 3 relocations, so a net increase during the year of 23 locations. In the fourth quarter -- of the 9 we opened, 5 were in the U.S., 2 were in Canada and 1 each in Korea and Japan. In fiscal '23, we expect to open 29 new warehouses, including 4 relos, so for a net of 25 new warehouses. These 25 planned net new openings are made up of 15 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International, including our first locations in each of New Zealand and Sweden, and our third and fourth locations in China.\nRegarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter Q4 spending CapEx was approximately $1.26 billion. And for the full year, CapEx expenditures was $3.9 billion. Our estimate for the coming year fiscal '23 CapEx to be approximately the same, in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range.\nIn terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in the fourth quarter, ex FX, increased 8.4%. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tires, lawn, patio and garden, prescription pharmacy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department in dollars, what we call majors, which includes everything from computers to appliances to TVs to audio, et cetera, was up in the high single digits. And CostcoGrocery, including our third-party delivery, 2-Day, dry, fresh and frozen, continue to grow. They were up 20% in the quarter.\nAn update on Costco Logistics. With Costco Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of the merchandise and improve delivery times on service levels to our members, and I'll share with you some statistics to that in a minute.\nPrior to this acquisition, in the U.S., we were completing a few years ago about 2 million big and bulky deliveries and installations per year. In fiscal '22, we completed 4.3 million big and bulky deliveries and installation. Previously, all of those 2 million deliveries and installations were made by third parties. In fiscal '22, about 70% or a little over 3 million of the 4.3 million were done by us. In the fourth quarter, in fact, that percentage of deliveries and installations done by -- performed by us was 81%.\nPre-acquisition, the estimated average days to deliver was above 15 days, and we were working with over 100 delivery partners. Today, our average delivery time for big and bulky is just under 5 days, and we're continuing to work to improve that. And we were down to 8 delivery -- primary delivery partners.\nA few comments regarding inflation. We've seen minor improvement in a few areas. But all in, pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages and higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions. They're still present, but we are seeing just a little light at the end of the tunnel. And if you recall in the third quarter, we indicated that price inflation overall was about 7% plus for us. For the fourth quarter and talking with our merchants, the estimated price inflation overall was about 8%, a little higher on the food and sundries side, a little lower on fresh foods, and both higher and lower on the nonfood side.\nWe're seeing commodities -- some commodities prices coming down, such as gas, steel, beef, relative to a year ago, even some small cost changes in plastics. We're seeing some relief on container pricing. Wages are still the higher thing when we talk to our suppliers. And as we all know, wages still seem to be the one thing that's still relatively higher. But overall, some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel. And of course, that could change each week.\nIn all, despite current inflation levels, we believe we continue to remain competitive versus others and able to raise prices as cost increases. Hopefully, of course, a little less than others with who we compete.\nMany of you have asked about private label with the recent inflationary environment and what's happening, are people trading down. And of course, our first response, of course, is they're not trading down. They're trading up or certainly trading the same.\nIn terms of Kirkland Signature merchandise penetration, and excluding gas and other businesses that carry the Kirkland name. Kirkland Signature merchandise is up just under 1% in terms of penetration compared to a year ago. Our KS merchandise penetration is about 28% for the year. This is similar to historical trends where it's increasing slowly and steadily over time. So no big dramatic change from the past there.\nIn terms of supply chain. Generally, supply chain has improved a little, including on-time deliveries. We started seeing container prices coming down. The first place you see it, of course, is in the spot market. And then you'll start to see it hopefully in some other contracts as they continue. No longer any big capacity issues or container shortages. Domestically, port delays have improved. And while the rail strike that was in the news a few weeks ago was thankfully averted, in anticipation of strike, there were some rail ramp closures and delays in restarting that. But the view from our buyers is that this should be eliminated for the most part towards the end of this week.\nSwitching over to inventory levels. Our total inventory at Q4 end was up year-over-year, just -- was up just under 26% year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter, it was up just over 26%. Of the 26% increase, an estimated 10 to 11 percentage points of it is inflation. That's that 8% number. And new warehouse growth, that's that 3% number in terms of unit growth over the last year, but still up year-over-year.\nAdditionally, we're lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand, specifically in nonfood areas where last year, we were about 90% of our target at inventory levels. Food and sundries and fresh are in good shape, we feel. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year.\nIn terms of nonfood inventories. It's up in certain categories. Again, this is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, as mentioned earlier. The good news so far, initial seasonal sales seem to be going well, as evidenced in our monthly sales reports. And all told, we would expect the 26% year-over-year increase to start to head down as it has in just the past few weeks a little bit.\nLastly, as a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 2, this next week on Wednesday -- in 2 weeks, on Wednesday, October 5, after the market close -- closes.\nWith that, I will open it up to questions and answers with Latif. Thanks.",

Welcome to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert E. Nelson\n\nSenior VP of Financial Planning & IR and Treasury, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Erica, and good afternoon to everyone. This is Bob Nelson, Senior VP of Finance and Investor Relations here at Costco. Thank you for dialing in into today's conference call to review our third quarter fiscal year '22 operating results.\nBefore we begin, a couple of housekeeping items to take care of. First, as you now have surmised, Richard is not with us today. He is doing great and wishes he could be on the call. He is in Italy with his family on a rescheduled vacation that was canceled early in the pandemic. He wanted me to pass along his best to everyone. And in his absence, I will be filling in for him today.\nSecondly, and before we get into the details of today's earnings results, I need to read our safe harbor disclosure. Let's begin. These discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\nOkay. With that out of the way, let's get to it. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended this past May 8. Net income for the quarter was $1.353 billion, $3.04 per diluted share. The reported $3.04 included a onetime $77 million pretax charge, $0.13 per diluted share, for incremental benefits awarded under the new employee agreement effective this past March 14. Last year's third quarter net income was $1.22 billion, $2.75 per diluted share, which included $57 million pretax or $0.09 per diluted share for costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages.\nIn terms of this year's $77 million pretax charge, this was in conjunction with our new employee agreement, again, effective this past March 14, and was primarily to adjust our benefit accrual to account for 1 additional day of vacation which is awarded to each employee immediately. The continuing impacts of the wage and benefit enhancements are reflected in SG&A and margin for this quarter and will be as well for subsequent quarters.\nNet income for the first 36 weeks of fiscal '22 was $3.98 billion, $8.94 per diluted share, and that compares to $3.34 billion or $7.51 per diluted share last year.\nLet's now review the metrics of our P&L, as always, starting with sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 16.3% to $51.61 billion, and that compares to $44.38 billion reported last year in Q3. In terms of comparable sales for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was better or up by 16.6%; Canada, better by 15.2%; Other International, up 5.7%; and total company, again, up 14.9%. Our e-com business in the third quarter reported better by 7.4% versus a year ago.\nFor the 12 weeks, excluding the benefit of gas inflation and the headwinds of FX, the U.S. came in at up 10.7%; Canada better by 12.8%; Other International up $9.1 million; and on a total company basis, ex gas inflation and FX headwinds, better by 10.8%; and e-commerce just below 8% at 7.9% for the quarter.\nIn terms of Q3 comp metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.6% in the U.S. Our average transaction was up 7.6% worldwide and up 10.4% in the U.S. during the quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by just a little over 1%. And our gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales in the quarter just a little bit more than 5%.\nThe best-performing categories in Q3 were candy, sundries, tires, toys, jewelry, kiosks, home furnishings, apparel, bakery and deli. Underperforming departments were liquor, office, sporting goods and hardware, all of which were quite strong a year ago. In terms of other business sales, the best performers came in from gasoline, travel, food course and our business centers. So overall, our sales grew nicely in the quarter and, for the most part, were pretty broad-based.\nMoving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in Q3 $984 million or 1.91 as a percentage of sales compared to last year's $901 million or 2.03 as a percentage of sales. That's up $83 million year-over-year or a 9.2% increase. And excluding headwinds from FX of about $10.6 million, membership was up 10.4% in the quarter.\nIn terms of renewal rates, we hit all-time highs. At Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.3%, up 0.3% from the 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And the worldwide rate came in at 90% for the first time in company history, and that's up 0.4% from what we reported at Q2 end. Renewal rates continue to benefit from the increased penetration of both auto renewals and more executive members and, in addition to that, higher first-year member renewal rates than what we have historically seen.\nIn terms of member counts, number of member households and cardholders at Q3 end, we ended Q3 with 64.4 million paid households and 116.6 million cardholders, both of those up over 6% compared to a year ago. At Q3 end, our paid executive memberships were 27.9 million, and that's an increase of just about 800,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 43% of our member base and over 71% of our worldwide sales.\nNow before I move on, I want to take just a minute and address the question that we've been getting a lot recently regarding the timing of the potential membership fee increase. Historically, we've raised fees every 5 to 6 years, with the last 3 increases coming, on average, at about the 5.5-year time frame and our last increase coming in June of 2017. As we approach this 5.5-year mark, there will be more discussions with Craig, Ron and the executive team. But for today, we have nothing more specific to report in terms of timing. In addition, given the current macro environment, the historically high inflation and the burden it's having on our members and all consumers in general, we think increasing our membership fee today ahead of our typical timing is not the right time. We will let you know, however, when that changes.\nOkay. Moving on along the P&L, let's take a look at gross margins. Our reported gross margins in the third quarter were lower year-over-year by 99 basis points, this year coming in at 10.19 as a percentage of sales, and that compares to last year's 11.18 that we reported a year ago. So the 99 basis points, down year-over-year and, excluding the negative impacts of gas inflation, we would have been down 53 basis points.\nSo if you would for me, and as normal, please jot down the following for our gross margin matrix and again, as usual, 2 columns: the first column being reported gross margin, the second column being gross margin without the impact of gas inflation. There are 6 rows: the first row being merchandise core; second, ancillary and other business; the third row, 2% rewards; followed by LIFO; other; and then total.\nSo in terms of our core merchandise margins on a reported basis, they were down 87 basis points versus last year, down 46 basis points ex gas; ancillary and other, plus 6 reported and plus 18 ex gas; 2% rewards, plus 8 and plus 3; LIFO, minus 25 basis points on a reported basis and minus 27 ex gas inflation; and finally, other, minus 1 with and without gas; so again, in total, down 99 reported, down 53, excluding the impact of gas inflation.\nA little color, more color, on gross margins, starting with core merchandise. The core merchandise contribution to gross margin was lower by 46 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Sales mix negatively impacted the core primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our gasoline sales, which were very strong in the quarter.\nIn terms of the core margins on their own sales in Q3, our core-on-core margins were lower by 39 basis points, approximately 2/3 of this coming from fresh foods. Fresh experienced a very difficult compare versus last year when the extraordinary volumes produced lower D&D and higher labor productivity a year ago. Also contributing to the fresh decline this quarter were higher raw material costs and higher labor costs due to our new wages.\nAncillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by 6 reported, higher by 18 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas, travel and business centers were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy and optical; again, 2% rewards, higher by 8 reported, higher by 3 ex gas; LIFO, minus 25 and minus 27 ex gas, as we recorded $130 million charge in the quarter for LIFO; and other was minus 1 basis point, both with and ex gas inflation. This included items from both years.\nLast year, we had $14 million of COVID expenses, primarily premium wages within gross margin. This year, we had a onetime charge discussed at the beginning of the call, the $20 million of the $77 million of which related to gross margin. The net result of these 2 items, again, minus 1 basis point. And while we continue to mitigate the impact of price increases as best as we can, we remain comfortable in our ability to pass through higher costs while providing great value to our members.\nMoving to SG&A. We showed good results. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 84 basis points, coming in at 8.62%, and that compares to last year's reported 9.46% SG&A figure. That's, again, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Again, if you jot down the following for our SG&A matrix, again, 2 columns, the first column being reported SG&A; the second column, SG&A ex the impacts of gas inflation. And we have 5 rows: the first row operations, second row central, third row stock compensation expense, fourth row other and then total is the fifth row.\nIn terms of our operations on a reported basis, SG&A was better by 68 basis points and, ex the benefit of gas inflation, better by 35; central better by 15 reported, better by 10 ex gas; stock compensation better by 2 reported, better by 1 ex-gas; and other minus 1 and minus 2 ex gas. Again, all total, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 excluding the benefit of gas inflation.\nIn Q3 year-over-year, the core operations component of SG&A was better by 68, again, 35 ex gas. Keep in mind, this result includes the starting wage increase we instituted this past October as well as 8 weeks of the new wage and benefit increases just implemented during Q3 on October 14 of this year. Central was better by 15 and better by 10 without gas; stock comp plus 2, plus 1 without gas; and again, other minus 1 basis point, minus 2 without gas inflation.\nSimilar to gross margin, this included items from both years. Last year, we had $44 million of COVID expenses. And this year, we had a onetime charge, again, discussed at the beginning of the call, $57 million of the $77 million, which related to SG&A. The net result of these 2 items, again, minus 1 reported, minus 2 ex gas inflation.\nSo all told, reported operating income in Q3 of this year increased 8%, coming in at $1.791 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $35 million this year versus $40 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 44 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX.\nOverall, pretax income came in for the quarter at up 11%, coming in at $1.827 billion, and that compares to the $1.65 billion which we reported a year ago. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 24.9%. That compares to 25.2% in Q3 last year. Overall, for the year, our effective tax rate is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%.\nA few other items of note. Warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened 1 net new warehouse plus 2 relocations. Q3 year-to-date, we have opened 17 warehouses, including 3 relocations, for a net of 14 new warehouses so far this fiscal year. For the remainder of the fiscal year and in Q4, we expect to open an additional 10 new warehouses, which will put us at 27 for the year, including 3 relocations and for a net of 24 net new warehouses for all of fiscal year '22. The 24 new warehouses by market are 14 in the U.S., 2 in Canada and 1 each in Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, China and our first opening in New Zealand which will occur in August of this year.\nIn terms of the new openings this year, this is 4 fewer than what we projected in Q2. Two of the 4 were impacted by supply chain issues related to electrical equipment and the other 2 have been delayed due to third-party site development issues. All 4 of these buildings are now scheduled to open by the end of calendar November, this fall. Incidentally, there are 3 in the U.S. and 1 in Australia that were delayed. The 1 net new opening in Q3 was a business center located in San Marcos, California. And the first of the 10 scheduled to open in Q4 opened this past week in Riverton, Utah, bringing our worldwide total to 830 Costcos as of today and around the world.\nRegarding CapEx, the Q3 F '22 spend was approximately $854 million. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated for the year to be just shy of about $4 billion.\nIn terms of our e-com business, e-com sales in Q3, ex FX, increased 7.9%. This is on top of the 38% increase a year ago. Stronger departments in the quarter were special order, patio and garden, jewelry and home furnishings. Our largest e-com merchandise department, majors, which includes consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, was up a little bit better than mid-single digits on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. And Costco grocery, including our third-party delivery, 2-day dry, fresh and frozen, continues to grow up low double digits in the quarter.\nAn update on Costco Logistics. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales for us. We averaged more than 58,000 stops a week in the third quarter. For the full year, we estimate total deliveries will be up 23% and will exceed 3 million. With logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of merchandise and improves delivery times and service levels for our members.\nOkay. Now a few comments regarding inflation. First of all, it continues. Pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages, higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions all still in play. For Q1, we estimated price inflation was in the 4.5% to 5% range. For Q2, we had estimated 6-ish, if you will. And for Q3, in talking to our merchants, estimated price inflation was in the 7-ish percent range. However, we did see inflation in fresh foods come in slightly lower in Q3 versus Q2 a year ago as we began cycling high meat prices. We believe our solid sales increases and relatively consistent margins show that we have continued to strike the right balance in passing on higher costs.\nSwitching over to inventory for a minute. Our total inventory in Q3 was up 26% year-over-year versus up 19% in Q2. A couple of high-level comments regarding inventory. A material component of the increase year-over-year is inflation rather than unit growth. We continue to expand and opened new locations, 20 new in the last 12 months. We are lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand. And we are purposely building inventory in our e-com business, primarily in big and bulky categories, as mentioned earlier in the call.\nFood and sundries and fresh is in very good shape. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. Nonfood inventories are up in certain categories. This is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, specifically, seasonal, lawn and garden, TVs, appliances and sporting goods. Otherwise, we are a little heavy in small appliances and domestics, primarily due to late-arriving merchandise this year. In addition, we have a few hundred million dollars of extra inventory in both late-arriving holiday merchandise from last season, which we're storing until this fall, and some buy-in merchandise to ensure proper inventory levels in the face of these ongoing supply chain issues.\nSpeaking with Craig, Ron and Claudine Adamo, our new Head of Merchandising, we feel good about our current inventory levels. The additional inventory we're carrying is in the right departments, and they feel good about our ability to move it.\nA quick update on China. Our first opening in China located in Minhang, Shanghai was closed for the last 6 weeks of the third quarter. That closure had a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $35 million in sales. As of May 18, we're happy to report that the building is back open but operating under restrictions on the number of people that can be in the building at one time, among other, cleaning and operating restrictions.\nOur second building in Suzhou, which opened in this last December, has largely avoided the lockdowns and restrictions to this point. We're currently targeting an opening date of this December for our third Shanghai building in Pudong. The timing although will somewhat depend on the area remaining open for the next several months and not being more negatively impacted by lockdowns.\nFour additional China buildings are currently underway and planned with opening dates in the next 2 years. These would be our first China openings outside of Shanghai. I believe of those 4, 1 is in fiscal '23 and 3 in fiscal '24.\nAs a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the 4 weeks ending Sunday, May 29, this next week on Thursday, June 2, after market close. This is a day later than our traditional Wednesday release due to the Memorial Day holiday.\nBefore wrapping up, a quick shout out to the 300,000 worldwide Costco employees around the globe and the excellent work and proactive effort they give each day to navigate during these most challenging environment. Our merchants and operators are the best in the business, and their hard work is reflected in our strong operating results.\nFinally, I want to address some incorrect information floating around on social media and a few other media outlets claiming that we have increased the price of our $1.50 hotdog-and-soda combinations sold in our food courts. Let me just say the price, when we introduced the hot dog-soda combo in the mid-'80s, was $1.50. The price today is $1.50, and we have no plans to increase the price at this time.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Erica and open it up for Q&A. Thank you.",

Welcome to the Q2 earnings call and February sales results. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard A. Galanti\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Director, Costco Wholesale Corporation\n\nThank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\nIn today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended this past February 13, as well as February retail results for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27.\nNet income for the quarter came in at $1,299 million or $2.92 per diluted share. Last year's second quarter net income came in at $951 million or $2.14 per diluted share. That latter number included a $246 million pretax or $0.41 per share costs, incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages.\nNet income for the 24 weeks was $2.62 billion or $5.90 per share compared to $2.12 billion or $4.76 per diluted share last year in the first half. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.1% to $50.94 billion, up from $43.89 billion last year in the second quarter. Comparable sales in the second quarter for fiscal '22, on a reported basis, U.S. sales increase during the 12-week period was 15.8% and, gas inflation, 11.3%; Canada, 16% reported, 12.4% ex gas inflation and FX; other International, 6.2%; and plus 9% ex gas inflation and FX for the total company reported number of 14.4% on a same-store comparable basis and up 11.1%, excluding gas inflation effects. E-commerce, on a reported basis, up 12.5% and FX, up 12.6%.\nIn terms of our second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.3% worldwide and up 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 4.6% worldwide and up 6.9% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 60 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 390 basis points. I will review our February sales results later in the call.\nGoing down our second quarter fiscal 2022 income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $967 million, up $86 million or up 9.8% from a year earlier, $881 million. There was about a $6.5 million impact -- negative impact due to FX. So on an ex FX basis, if you will, the $86 million increase would have been up $92 million or 10.4%.\nIn terms of renewal rates, they continue to increase. At second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.0%, up 0.4 percentage point from the 12-week earlier Q1 end. And worldwide rate, it came in at 89.6%, up 0.6% from where it stood 12 weeks earlier at Q1 end. Our renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members' auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members, and higher first year renewal rates for our new members. In terms of the number of members at second quarter end, member households and total cardholders. Total households was 63.4 million, up 900,000 from the 62.5 million just 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders at Q2 end, 114.8 million, up 1.7 million from the 113.1 million figure 12 weeks ago.\nAt second quarter end, paid executive memberships stood at $27.1 million, an increase of $644,000 during the 12-week period since Q1 end. Executive members, by the way, represent now 42.7% of our total membership base and 70.9% of our total sales.\nMoving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, but up 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation. As I always do, I'll ask you to judge on a few numbers, 2 columns. The first column is reported, the second column would be excluding gas inflation.\nFirst line item, merchandise core merchandise on a reported basis was down 75% -- 75 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, down 43. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 40 basis points and ex gas inflation, plus 49 basis points, 2% reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis points; LIFO, minus 14 and minus 14 basis points; other plus 14 and plus 14 basis points. So totally, on a reported basis, again, year-over-year, minus 32 basis points and excluding gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. Now in terms of the core merchandise component being lower by 75% year-over-year reported and 43 -- minus 43 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q2 that the core reported was plus 71 basis points in ex gas plus 63, so still improved to where we were 2 years ago, prepandemic and ex gas.\nIn terms of the core margin on its own sales, in Q2, are poor on core margin, if you will, was lower by 28 basis points year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of this coming from fresh foods and a little from foods and sundries and nonfoods as well.\nFresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales a year ago in the second quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 40 basis points and by 49 ex gas in the quarter. Gas travel, business centers and pharmacy were all better year-over-year, offset by e-comm and optical. LIFO, we had a 14 basis point hit year-over-year to LIFO, or $71 million LIFO charge during the quarter, both with and without gas inflation. Recall that our Q1 LIFO charge year-over-year was $14 million or in the first quarter was $14 million or a 3 basis point delta versus the prior year.\nIt's been the last 3 fiscal quarters that we've actually pointed out LIFO as we saw a little bit of inflation going back to December or Q4 of fiscal '21, a little more in Q1 of this fiscal year. And as with everything you read in the news, quite a bit more in Q2. Our 2% reward was higher on a reported basis by 3% and minus 1, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of increased penetration of the 2% reward executive members and other was plus 14 basis points year-over-year. This is related to the COVID-related costs from a year ago, about $60 million. That's the portion of COVID-related wages that go into cost of sales that like related to manufacturing businesses as well as their meat and bakery departments.\nOverall, a pretty good showing on the gross margin, given the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures.\nMoving to expenses, to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 94 basis points, and better by 63 basis points, excluding gas inflation, Again, jotting down 2 columns of numbers reported and the second one, ex gas inflation. Operations, plus 36 basis points and plus 9. Here, a plus is good. It means it's lower year-over-year. Central, plus 13, plus 10; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 2; other, plus 42 and plus 42, for a total of plus 94 and plus 63. So better or lower by 94 basis points reported and better or lower by 63 basis points ex gas inflation.\nNow again, looking at the first line item, operations. The core operations component, better again by 36, but as well better by 9 or lower by 9 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind that this improvement occurred despite both the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 is now anniversary-ing and the additional starting wage increases from our 2 basic hourly scale service assisted and services by an additional $0.50 an hour, that occurred in October of 2021.\nCentral, better by 13 basis points or 10 ex gas inflation. It's pretty straightforward operating leverage on strong sales figures. Stock comp, plus 2 and plus 2, again, a reflection of good sales. And other, this plus 42 basis points, this was the $2 COVID wages of $186 million that goes into SG&A in Q2 a year ago. So again, on a year-over-year basis, that was that improvement.\nIn terms of preopening expenses in past conference calls, really since we went public, I think, we've covered that preopening expenses next on this discussion. Starting this fiscal year, going forward, preopening is now included in SG&A. The year-over-year change in SG&A related to preopening was flat year-over-year, no basis point delta year-over-year in the second quarter. All told, reported operating income in Q2 increased 35% on a reported basis, coming in at $1,812 million this year compared to $1,340 million a year ago in the second quarter.\nBelow the operating income line, interest expense was $36 million this year versus $40 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million year-over-year, $25 million this year versus $19 million last year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the quarter was up 37%, coming in at $1.801 billion compared to $1.319 billion a year earlier.\nIn terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q2 was slightly higher than it was in Q2 a year ago. It came in at 26.7% compared to 26.4% a year ago in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate is currently -- it continues to be projected to be in the 26% to 27% range for the fiscal year.\nA few other items of note. Warehouse expansion. For the year, we now plan to have 32 new units and 32 units, including 4 relocations. So replacing existing units to larger and better located facilities. So net total of 28. I think a quarter ago, we actually said it was a net total of 27, so 1 more than that. However, remember, several of these are slotted to open in Q4, our fiscal Q4, 1 of them or 14 net new. So there's always a potential for 1 of those to shift into the next fiscal year.\nThe 5 openings in Q2 that we had, one each in Mexico or 40th in Mexico, our second in France, our second in China, our fourth in Spain and 1 additional unit in Florida, where we now have 29 locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our Q2 spend for CapEx was approximately $723 million, and our full year CapEx spend is still estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.\nMoving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in Q2 ex FX, as I mentioned earlier, increased 12.6% year-over-year. And that's, of course, on top of a second quarter fiscal '21 increase of 75% increase last year, benefiting, of course, from COVID. Stronger departments in e-commerce in terms of year-over-year percentage increases, jewelry, tires, special or kiosk items, patio and garden and home furnishings. Our largest online merchandise department majors, which consists of consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, et cetera, was up in the high single digits on very strong sales increases a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, that continues to drive big and bulky sales for the quarter. Deliveries were up year-over-year, 22%, and now about 85% of our U.S. e-comm less than truckload shipments from Costco Logistics, we're doing ourselves. Average during the quarter, we averaged more than 65,000 stops per week with Costco Logistics, which translates into a little over $3 million planned drops in Costco Logistics for the fiscal year.\nIn terms of e-comm and mobile apps, it continues to improve, much improved layout the ability to view warehouse receipts online, the ability to reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S. and Canada as well as reschedule returns pickups. Later this month, we'll have our warehouse inventory along with the Instacart inventory online, and be able to see all the detail of our in-line in-store merchandise as well. In terms of our e-commerce platform, Costco Next, we added a few additional suppliers. So we now have 37 suppliers online and growing. Again, Costco Next has about 1,000 items on it, curated items at Costco Values. Please give it a -- check it out.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined, both 12 and 24 weeks ago on the past quarterly earnings calls, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components and raw materials and ingredients and supplies, labor cost pressures, of course, as well as truck and driver shortages.\nOverall, we've done a pretty good job of giving the supply chain challenges. I think that's evidenced in our sales strength. They continue to be delayed to container arrivals, so we continue to advance order in many cases as we are able to. Virtually all departments are impacted, less product and packaging challenges, but still a few. Still some limitations on key items, but again, that's improving a little. Chip shortages are still 1 of the things that are impacting many items, some more than others. But again, we're managing temporal and driving sales.\nOne of the things that we've done that I mentioned last quarter, I mentioned we had chartered 3 small container vessels to help provide us with additional flexibility on shipping. We have now charged a total of 7 ocean vessels, up from those 3 -- for the next 3 years. And these are the transport 'containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. We've also leased containers for use in these ships. With these additions, about 1/4 of our annual trans-Pacific containers and shipment needs are being accommodated this way, which gives us additional supply chain flexibility.\nDespite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. From every day and every week, you're going to see in different items in different departments, certain things on allocation or short, but other things are filling its place. And again, some things are seeming to get a little better.\nMoving to inflation. Inflation, of course, continues, as evidenced by our LIFO charge. The inflationary pressures that we and others continue to see include higher labor costs, higher freight costs as well as higher transportation demand. Along with the container shortages and port lays that I just mentioned. Increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils chemicals to resins.\nHigher commodity prices from foodservice oils to additives and motor oils to plastics to detergents to paper products as well on the fresh side, proteins and butter and eggs and things like that. Not very different than what you hear and read and see from others. But again, we think we've done a pretty good job of corralling it as best we can.\nFor first quarter, a quarter ago, I mentioned that we estimated, at that time, overall price inflation to have been in the 4.5% to 5% range for the second quarter and talking with senior merchants, estimated overall price inflation was in the 6% range. All of this said, again, I want to give another shout-out to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and operators have all been able to do to keep -- in order to keep the products that we need pivot when and where necessary, keep our warehouses full like keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show great value versus our competitors.\nNow turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27, compared to the same 4-week period a year ago. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $16.29 billion, an increase of 15.9% from $14.05 billion a year earlier. Recall from January sales results that Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on February 1. That's 11 days earlier this past -- this year than last. This shift negatively impacted February's Other International by about 4 percentage points? And total company by about 0.5? Percentage point. Comparable sales for the 4 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 17.4%, ex gas and FX 12.9%; Canada reported 11.7%, ex gas and FX 8.8; Other international, minus 0.9% and ex gas and FX, a 1.3% to the positive. Total company, 14% and 10.6%, and e-comm within that number is 10.2% reported and 10.4% ex gas and FX.\nOur comp traffic and frequency for February was up 8% worldwide and 8.2% in the United States. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comp sales as follows: Canada by approximately 0.2%, Other International by approximately 4.5% and total company by approximately 0.7%. Gas price inflation positively impacted total reported comps by about 4% and average worldwide selling price per gallon was up year-over-year by 37%.\nWorldwide, the average transaction for February was up 5.5%. Our U.S. regions with the strongest sales were Texas, the Southeast and the Northeast. Other international and local currencies saw the strongest results in Australia, Mexico and the U.K.\nMoving to merchandise highlights for the month of February. Food and synergies was -- came in at a positive high single digits, fresh foods in the mid-single digits and nonfoods and deposit of high single digits. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-40s and with gas being certainly a driver of that as well as food court and hearing aids were the top performers.\nWith that, I want to mention just a couple of recent executive changes. A month ago, we reported that Ron Vachris became President of Costco. Ron started his career 39 years ago at Price Company and Price Club at the young age of 17. Most of his career was in operations through 2015. Then he spent a little over a year in real estate traveling the world and working on both worldwide and domestic expansion. And since that time, in 2016 has been in merchandising with certainly responsibly, not only for in-line merchandising, but online merchandising as well as very involved with logistics and transportation.\nAs well, just this week, internally, we reported that taking Ron's previous spot is Head of Merchandising is Claudine Adamo. Claudine has been with us for 30 years. She began in an hourly position in our Kirkland warehouse in 1992, 30 years ago. But a year later, he came into buying and has been buying ever since and most recently was Senior VP of nonfood sales -- of nonfoods merchandising. And again, he'll be taking over -- looking overall of merchandising.\nFinally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending April 3, on Sunday, April 3, on Wednesday, April 6 after the markets close.\nWith that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you very much.",

Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Costco's Q1 2026 Earnings Call. I'd like to start by reminding you that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\nComparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Before we dive into our financial results, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is once again joining me for today's call. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you, Gary. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with a few brief comments on some of our key growth initiatives before turning it back to Gary to discuss the results of the quarter. In Q1, we opened eight new warehouses, including a relocation in Canada, our third warehouse in France, four net new US locations, and two additional Canadian business centers. This brings our total warehouse count to 921 worldwide. We continue to see significant opportunities for future warehouse growth both domestically and across the international markets and where we operate. While delays with a couple of our buildings in Spain resulted in us revising our planned net new openings for fiscal year 2026 down to 28, we continue to plan for 30+ net openings per year in future years.\nWe've increased the size of our real estate team to support this goal, and without compromising on quality, we're being creative with real estate projects to further increase the potential for future growth. Recent examples of this include our new warehouse in Mulhouse, France, where we converted an old hypermart into a Costco warehouse, as well as two Canadian business centers that opened in the last month, both of which were refurbished home improvement warehouses. This approach broadens our options for market expansion and lowers the capital investment required. In addition to opening net new buildings, we will continue to relocate select high-volume warehouses to larger locations with more parking and expanded gas stations. By doing this, we're able to provide a better experience for our members and significantly accelerate sales growth in those markets. In fiscal year 2026, we have five relocations planned, including three in the US.\nOne each in Canada and Taiwan. The success of our new warehouse expansion has allowed us to consistently drive top-line revenue well in excess of our comparable sales and gain significant market share. We continue to see improvements in the performance of our new buildings and a reduction in their time to maturity. With fiscal year 2025 openings generating an annualized $192 million per warehouse of sales in the year of opening, that is up from $150 million for new warehouses opened just two years earlier. Turning to digital, our digital vision at Costco is to deliver a seamless experience that builds trust and loyalty with our members both in warehouse and online. We aim to make the shopping at Costco easier, faster, and more personal, no matter where or how our members choose to shop. This isn't about technology for technology's sake.\nIt's about using technology to strengthen the fundamentals that makes Costco who we are: increasing member loyalty, driving top-line sales, and improving efficiency in our operations so that we can bring goods to market at the lowest possible price. Progress has already begun and is delivering tangible results. In the warehouse, implementation of scanning memberships at entry, a Costco Digital Wallet, and pre-scanning small to medium-sized baskets is leading to better member experience and improved productivity. The warehouses that have first adopted this pre-scan technology have shown checkout speed improvements of up to 20%. And across our US warehouses overall, we achieved record levels of checkout productivity in the final weeks of the quarter. Online, we continue to make enhancements to improve the member experience on our site and app.\nAs an example, this quarter, we launched new personalization capabilities that provide members with more relevant product recommendations based on their past search history. The sales lift from this enhancement has been very positive. AI is also being interwoven into our business, where we believe it can strengthen our model. Again, we're approaching it in a very Costco way: practical, member-focused, and grounded in tangible business value. An early use case has involved integrating AI into our pharmacy inventory system. This system now compares prescription drug pricing across vendors and autonomously and predictably reorders inventory, improving our in-stocks to more than 98%. This change has played an important role in helping us achieve mid-teen growth in pharmacy scripts filled and has improved margins while lowering prices to our members.\nWe're now in the process of deploying AI tools in our gas business, which we expect will improve inventory management and drive incremental sales by ensuring we're always delivering the best value to our members. These are just a few of the use cases we're developing into our business as we speak. While digital and technology will play an important role in our future, our people are what makes Costco special. I'd like to recognize the outstanding work done by our more than 340,000 employees around the world. Their commitment to our company and the Costco experience for our members is what drives our success. I'd like to thank our entire team for their outstanding work this year and especially now during our busiest season. I also wanted to mention that our annual update to Costco's sustainability commitments was made available online earlier this month.\nThis report provides a comprehensive review of the progress we're making towards our sustainability objectives, and I would encourage you to take a look. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, the 12 weeks ending 23rd November. As usual, we published a slide deck under events and presentations on our investor website with supplemental information to support today's press release. Net income for the first quarter came in at $2.001 billion, or $4.50 per diluted share, up from $1.798 billion, or $4.04 per diluted share in the first quarter last year. This year's results include a tax benefit of $72 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, relating to stock-based compensation. Last year's results include a tax benefit of $100 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, also related to stock-based compensation. Excluding these discrete tax items, net income and earnings per diluted share both grew 13.6%.\nNet sales for the first quarter were $65.98 billion, an increase of 8.2% from $60.99 billion in the first quarter last year. Comparable sales were 6.4%, both before and after adjusting for gas price deflation and FX. Excluding gas sales entirely and adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, comparable sales were 7.1%. Digitally enabled comparable sales were 20.5%, both with and without adjusting for FX. Our segment breakout of comparable sales is disclosed in both our earnings release and the supplemental slide deck. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, FX positively impacted sales by approximately 0.1%, while gas price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.1%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.1% worldwide, and our average transaction or ticket was up 3.2% worldwide, both with and without the impacts of gas price deflation and FX.\nMoving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.329 billion, an increase of $163 million, or 14% year-over-year. Adjusting for FX, the increase was also 14%. Last September's US and Canada membership fee increase accounted for a little less than half of membership income growth. Excluding the membership fee increase and FX, membership income grew 7.3% year-over-year. This was driven by continued growth in our membership base and increased upgrades from Gold Star to Executive Membership. At Q1 end, we had 39.7 million paid Executive Memberships, up 9.1% versus last year. We ended the quarter with 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% versus last year, and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year-over-year. In terms of renewal rates, at Q1 end, our US.\nCanada renewal rate was 92.2%, and the worldwide rate came in at 89.7%, both down 10 basis points from last quarter. This slight decline was due to the factors we discussed last quarter and reflects new online members growing as a percentage of our total base, and renewing at a slightly lower rate than warehouse sign-ups. The decline was less than anticipated due to some early success with targeted communications to expiring members. Our goal is to continue to improve renewal rates by improving engagement with members who signed up digitally. Although for the reasons previously shared, we may still see a slight decline in the overall renewal rate over the next few quarters. Turning to gross margin, our reported rate was higher year-over-year by four basis points, both with and without gas deflation, coming in at 11.32% compared to 11.28% last year. Core was flat.\nIn terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 30 basis points. This increase was broad-based, with Non-Foods, Foods and Sundries, and Fresh all higher year-over-year. Supply chain improvements and an increase in KS penetration benefited margins, as did additional marketing revenue. The improvement in core-on-core was offset by changes in mix and lapping higher income in our co-brand credit card program a year ago. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was higher by seven basis points, primarily driven by pharmacy and hearing aids. LIFO negatively impacted the gross margin rate by three basis points. We had a $1.9 million LIFO credit in Q1 this year compared to a $19 million credit in Q1 last year.\nMoving on to SG&A, our reported SG&A rate was higher or worse year-over-year by one basis point, coming in at 9.6% compared to last year's 9.59%. The operations component of SG&A was higher or worse by one basis point. Our operators did a great job improving productivity and capturing efficiency benefits from the technology investments that Ron referenced earlier. These productivity improvements fully offset wage investments and the impact of extended operating hours and would have created positive leverage in the quarter had we not experienced higher healthcare costs. Central was lower or better by three basis points. This quarter's SG&A also included a charge relating to a tax assessment for prior years, which negatively impacted the rate by four basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $35 million versus $37 million last year.\nInterest income was $122 million versus $96 million last year, driven by higher cash balances. And FX, another was a $33 million benefit versus a $51 million benefit last year due to lower FX gains. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 22.5% compared to 22% in Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited $72 million, and last year's rate benefited $100 million from annual RSU vestings. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. Capital expenditure in Q1 was approximately $1.53 billion. As shared last quarter, we are making additional investments to support a higher number of new warehouse openings, increased warehouse remodels to drive continued growth in existing high-volume buildings, depot network expansion, and digital. We estimate capital expenditure for the full year will be approximately $6.5 billion.\nBefore we take a closer look at core merchandising results for Q1, here are a few fun facts about the holiday selling season so far. Our US food court set a daily record on Halloween, selling 358,000 whole pizzas, an increase of 31% versus last year. Black Friday was a record-breaking day for our US e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders. Our US bakeries also set a record in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, selling 4.5 million pies. That's over 7,000 pies per warehouse over a three-day period. Turning to Q1 merchandising highlights, our relentless focus on quality, value, and newness continued to deliver market share gains across virtually all departments. Fresh sales were up mid to high single digits, led by double-digit growth in meat.\nWe saw strong growth in higher-cost cuts of beef and even greater unit growth in lower-cost proteins like ground beef and poultry. Bakery experienced high single-digit growth, driven by the introduction of some great new items, such as our holiday dessert bars and our Crème Brûlée Bar Cake. Non-Foods have comp sales in the mid-single digits. Our buyers continue to do an excellent job finding new and exciting items at great values, while also adjusting our assortment to minimize the impact of tariffs. Golden jewelry, special events, health, and beauty were all up double digits. Majors, tires, and small appliances also continue to outperform with high single-digit comps. We added a number of new national brand partnerships across a range of non-food categories in Q1, including Gap and Ulta gift cards, Vera Bradley apparel, and Upper Deck trading cards.\nFood and sundries comps also grew mid-single digits, with candy and food showing the strongest results. Newness has been driving growth in this category as well, with on-trend items such as Dubai chocolate performing very well. Kirkland Signature continues to grow at a faster pace than overall sales, with KS items typically offering 15 to 20% value compared to the national brand alternative with equal or better quality. In Q1, we launched approximately 45 new KS items, including Dry Facial Daily Clean Towels, Caramelized Blueberry Croissants, and various apparel items, in addition to our latest food court offering, the Caramel Brownie Sundae. As always, our goal is to be the first to lower prices where we see opportunities to do so.\nA few examples of lower prices this quarter include KS chicken pot pie from $4.29 to 3.99 per lb, KS Bacon from $18.99 to 16.99 per packet, KS Whipped Cream three-pack from $10.49 to 8.99, and KS Walnuts three-pound pack from $14.49 to 12.99. In digital, site traffic in the quarter was up 24%, and app traffic was up 48%. Sales in Non-Foods were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics, apparel, and Majors, all of which grew double digits year-over-year. Our same-day delivery service offered in partnership with Instacart in the US and Uber Eats and DoorDash internationally also performed extremely well, growing at a faster pace than our overall digital sales. Strong traffic and sales growth in digital were aided by continued web and app improvements, as well as the introduction of more personalized member communications.\nWe continue to see many opportunities to enhance digital engagement with our members and look forward to sharing progress on future earnings calls. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy, food court, hearing aids, and optical departments all had strong quarters. Gas comps were low single digits. Gas prices remained slightly deflationary in the quarter, but this was offset by volume growth. Costco Travel is another way in which we deliver unique membership value, and these services continue to resonate well with our members. Our member-only rates for vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and rental cars often lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in savings, in addition to the great service provided by our fantastic Costco Travel agents. Costco Travel US set an all-time daily sales record on Cyber Monday, before beating that record a day later on 2 December.\nIn all, we achieved over $100 million in gross bookings in the US through Costco Travel in the five days following Thanksgiving, up 12% from last year. Turning to inflation, overall inflation remained relatively consistent with recent quarters. Fresh and food and sundries saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood, and coffee, but this was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter, and produce. In Non-Foods, we saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Our buyers continue to do a great job reducing the impact of tariffs for our members.\nThe strategies being deployed to achieve this include changing the country of production for some items, sourcing more items produced in the US, consolidating buying efforts globally to lower the cost of goods across all our markets, and leaning into Kirkland Signature, where we have more control over the supply chain. Additionally, we are changing our item assortment where appropriate. As discussed last quarter, while we have a robust and exciting holiday merchandise selection in our US warehouses, this represents a lower number of SKUs than in prior years. In replacement of some tariff-impacted items, our buyers have sourced a number of alternative great value items, including seasonal food, health and beauty, and live goods. In many cases, these items are produced in the US and are largely unimpacted by tariffs. The supply chain has remained stable, and our merchants feel very good about our inventory position.\nBy optimizing our inventory flow and reducing some of the higher inventory levels we built up a year ago in the face of greater supply chain uncertainty at that time, we've been able to improve working capital and lower the labor required to manage inventory without impacting in-stocks or sales. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, 4th January, on Wednesday, 7th January, after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the lineup for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one to join the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Ron, one of the observations that the market has is under your tenure, Costco's had a greater willingness to move with speed, embrace technology, and the different modes of retail and change a bit more than in the past. Is that a fair conclusion? And given the benefits of these actions that you're taking, such as greater productivity and efficiency, would you be willing to continue to let the financial benefits fall to the bottom line, or do you see a greater need to reinvest back in the business in areas like price to continue to drive the top line? Thank you very much.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYou're welcome, Michael. You know, technology and bringing the company along has been a focus for several years. We've had to spend a couple of years ago. We really focused on our fundamental base systems and our core systems behind the scenes that will allow us to build for the future. So we're now coming to a fruition where we're starting to see the benefits of that hard work, of all the backroom systems that we had to build that are now coming to light and coming to the front face for our members. You know, we feel that technology is going to be part of the peak part of our future. I think it's equally as important as all of our other initiatives that we have out there, but we will never succumb to not being the best price and driving prices down for our members.\nThat's what Costco is known for, and that will always be our leading mantra.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenoir Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good evening, guys. So a quick follow-up on the latter and then the former question, and then a second question. So as you think about results recently, they're strong and absolute standards. I think the market holds you to very high standards. Is there any concern that you see on the traffic side where there's more of an impetus to invest in price? And then secondly, it looks like executive members per week grew at an accelerated pace from Q4 to Q1. How are you looking at that in terms of the overall benefit of extending the hours, both in terms of the lift that you're seeing in sales, and is this also driving accelerated sign-up? Thanks very much.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah, thanks for the questions, Chris. First of all, I guess on your point around sales and overall sort of membership growth in the business, you know, I think from our perspective, we look at it very much over the last, really, six to 12 months. And when we look at the sort of trends and step back from what we're seeing with the member, there's a lot of consistency, actually. You know, overall, I think we've shared over the last couple of quarters, when we talk about what members are looking for, they're looking for value, for quality, and for newness. And I think we've done a great job. Our buyers and operators did a great job of bringing that to our members. And when you look at month by month, there's definitely been some lumpiness in the individual monthly sales results that we've posted.\nBut a lot of that has been to do with whether it was uncertainty around tariffs one month to another or port strikes that we had to cycle. And if you sort of take a step back and look at the last seven months that we've reported and the last two quarters, you know, our average sales have been around that 6.5% growth. We had 6.4% comps adjusted for gas and FX in Q4. We had 6.4% Q1 this quarter. And actually, if you look at every individual month, there was only two months in that last seven months that were outside of the range of 6% to 7. So I think sometimes there's a bit of fixation on individual month or one particular point of data.\nBut actually, when we look at what we're seeing with the overall sort of patterns of how members are shopping and how they're behaving, we've seen a very sort of consistent pattern and a consistency in the results. So our goal is to really continue to make sure we're delivering on that value, quality, and newness and ensure that we continue to see that growth in membership counts, in their frequency of visiting, and in the items that they're putting in the basket. And generally, when you look across whether it's Non-Foods, food and sundries, and Fresh, we've seen consistency in performance and growing market share in those areas. So we'll continue to focus on making sure we're delivering on that value, but feel good about the overall sort of consistency in the results that we've been seeing.\nI think the second part of your question maybe was around Executive Membership. And yeah, I think we've been very pleased with the membership response to the extended operating hours. And also, you may remember we added $10 per month as an extra benefit for Executive Members who shop on Instacart. You know, the extended opening hours that we did were certainly a major benefit for our Executive Members, having an extra hour in the morning on most days to shop the warehouse. But we also added an extra hour on a Saturday evening for all of our members. And if you think about the earlier hours, it often extends the total shopping of members in the warehouse. So it spreads out the traffic, if you like, to make the experience better for all our members.\nSo we felt very positive about the change that we've seen. It's certainly been well received by members. We've seen a really nice uptick in executive upgrades, to your point. And you know, it gets hard to track the spend uplift because of the further away from the change you go. You know, it's more difficult to sort of parse the differences that are happening in the impact on sales. But we still think that sort of 1% lift was a reasonable kind of view of what we think the impact was. And of course, as I mentioned earlier, you see sort of different puts and takes that I would sort of, if I look at our overall sort of sales trends, I think I look at it as it's probably offset some of that cycling of gift cards and gold that we were expecting at this time of year.\nWe've been able to maintain that overall sales growth even with those impacts.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenoir Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutmann with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Ron. Hey, Gary. My question is on how you're doing warehouse openings in the US. I think we're going to get to the highest number, something like 20 years next year. So do you do anything different from a membership perspective? I know we're lapping some of the short-term promotions that you did on membership. Is there anything you do different as you approach next year?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nNo, I don't think so. Next year's openings will be a good mix of some infills in established markets, and we still have some opportunities in some new markets. So, you know, several of the infill locations don't result in a whole lot of sign-ups, but really drive a lot of top-line sales because it really addresses the frequency aspect of things. Then the new markets, we've done several of those this year, and we have a few more slated for next year of markets that we may have been a little reluctant to go into. We've got much greater confidence at this point, and we'll garner a much better new sign-up approach in those markets as well. So a lot of, you know, continuing on what we've done before, but some different type of scenarios as we move forward in the US.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Thanks, Ron and Gary. On the technology side, it's been really exciting. As we think about retail media, there are plenty of companies that really want to work with you deeply on digital advertising. We'd love your thoughts there. Also, as you approach the marketplace in a customer-centric way, we'd love to have your thoughts on that development. Finally, AI and gas. AI has so many applications across the customer experience, as well as employees, and inventory management. What's on your roadmap for how that will innovate your business going forward? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks for the questions, Oliver. Yeah, I'll take the retail media question first. Yeah, you know, we've talked about retail media a few times now on the calls, and I definitely believe that it's a meaningful opportunity for us. You know, I always like to start the conversation on retail media, though, to remind everybody that we have a pretty large, you know, alternative profit business that many other retailers would define that way today. And I called out a couple of them on the call today. You know, outside of financial services, we have a large travel business. We have a traditional sort of media revenue business that we generate meaningful dollars today. And both of those were actually travel, and the sort of marketing and media revenue, were tailwinds to our business in the quarter.\nSo there's a number of strengths that we have today in that space that are part of our model that I think showed through in the ability to keep investing in the member and still expanding our operating margins during the quarter. You know, that being said, we think of retail media as a slightly different opportunity from those because it really is about tapping into that marketing spend that many of our suppliers are investing in other places to, you know, to drive their marketing awareness and drive return on ad spend. We are in the early innings. I would still say of retail media, we've been building out, as Ron alluded to earlier, the sort of data and tech platform that allows us to execute personalization at scale.\nAnd I think for us, the first priority with personalization is to deliver a better member experience, is to deliver more targeted, relevant messaging so we drive more items in the basket, more visits to the warehouse, more visits online. And as you do those things, it just creates an even more compelling value proposition for our media partners. While we're building and executing on that capability, we've been introducing some media activity on third-party sites. So think of that as being, you may have seen, you have the Costco Auto Program that will run on digital TV. And we've done some targeted MVM amplification campaigns with some of our CPG partners that have been very successful as well. We also recently launched advertising on our gas pumps as a new channel for us as well around new media opportunities.\nSo I think the headlines would be we're seeing some early success, but it's still very much an opportunity in the future on the roadmap for us. And a bit like Ron mentioned earlier, you know, all of our focus is on how do we drive more value for the member. So as you might expect, the vast majority of the value created here will reinvest in the member to drive down prices, and value, and increase sales. And we actually think that's a real advantage with the national brand partners that we work with on media because they know that we're committed to really driving the flywheel and driving growth in their overall business.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nOn the AI front, we're extremely excited about what the future holds for us. I mean, we see many opportunities that are really business-driven and tangible, have great tangible business value for us. You look at things like our procurement system, as we are a global retailer and we buy from around the world, as well as supply chain, what it can do there. Just the tools that we've seen that this has improved our employees' work abilities and their skill sets, as well as they do their day-to-day work. So we see a lot of value. We're very excited about the journey. We look at it in a two-phase approach, that concurrently we're going to be focusing on member-facing. How do we improve the experience for the member through AI? And then, business basics. How do we continue to focus on the business basics?\nYou know, our mantra is bring goods to market at the lowest possible price. We think AI has a great aspect to that and really can help us become a much better merchant out there.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nBest regards. Happy holidays.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHi, Gary. Hi, Ron. Nice quarter. In your annual report, your sales waterfall chart is impressive. The class of 2025, $192 million in sales versus $150 million in 2023. Can you help us think about the opportunity to continue to expand on this front and the steps you're taking to continue to improve productivity within the store?\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYou know, we see a good horizon on expansion. You know, we continue to, the creativity, I mentioned just a couple of examples of things that we're doing differently. We've got a project in Los Angeles where we're working with some developers that there's some affordable housing going above Costco just north of LAX. That project will open up in 2027. That would be a market that we could, it's Baldwin Hills is where it's called. That would be a market we would never be able to go into and find 25 acres to build a Costco. It just wouldn't happen. So we're finding creative ways to get closer to our members and to relieve some pressure from some of our highest volume locations.\nAnd again, like I said, we continue to see some opportunities in markets that we would have questioned in the past due to maybe some competition is there. But we feel much stronger going in and attacking these markets. So, you know, like I said in the early opening remarks, good runway for 30+ locations as we look forward for the next few years for sure. And a good combination of both type of openings. And international still presents some very good strengths for us in our recent Sweden opening, our second location in Sweden, and our third in France. And we've got quite a few in Asia that are upcoming as well. So we feel really strong about our future expansion.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nAnd Chuck, I think on the point on the growth per warehouse, I think Ron's final point there is a really important one around the balance that we're able to get. So we find with many of the US and Canada warehouses where we're filling in, we can accelerate the sales very quickly because Costco is known. We're sort of filling capacity where maybe there's some very busy warehouses around. So it really helps the economic model with getting returns from the quick acceleration in sales growth. And then in the international markets or places where we have less penetration of warehouses, it really drives a significant increase in new member counts. So it's nice to have a balance between those two. The returns look a little bit different in how you get there, but they both generate strong return on investment in different ways.\nThey create a nice balance in the business overall as we grow.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nOkay.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThe renewal rate. Hi. The renewal rate softness sounded better than what you expected. Could you maybe talk to some of the things you did to try and offset the softness from the more digital numbers?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Yeah. You're exactly right. You know, when we talked about the membership renewal rate last quarter, we'd shared that as a result of this change in mix around us adding more new digitally engaged members or signing up digitally to become a Costco member, what we've always seen with that group is that they're generally a bit younger. And generally speaking, they renew at a slightly lower rate. That's always been true, but there's a bigger number of them now coming into the base. So as they flow into the math model, it's impacting the overall renewal rate. And so I think you may have heard us talk last quarter.\nWe said we think, while that's sort of a mathematical fact, we think there are opportunities for us to be able to change that outcome by delivering more targeted and relevant communication to those members that have signed up digitally and are reaching that point in maturity where they're considering whether to renew or not to renew their membership with us. And so our membership team is really focused on delivering targeted, relevant messaging to engage those members to ensure they continue to see the value of the membership and really helping them see why there's significant value for them to continue to be members. And what you saw in this quarter was really some of the early work the team's done to engage those members and improve the renewal rate. And obviously, it's early days.\nWe want to make sure that we can continue to build that momentum. But it's been encouraging to see the impact of those changes. We were expecting, based on purely flowing through the sort of the renewal rate that we'd seen before, to see a slightly higher decline in the quarter. We were able to offset a part of that with the changes that we made in communicating with members.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOh, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about digital. Maybe if there's any metrics you guys can share with the success you're having, maybe how many met what percentage of the membership that's engaging with you digitally now versus before? I don't think I may have missed it, but any stats around Costco Logistics, how you're doing with delivery there? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Peter. Yeah, we haven't typically talked about the percentage of members that are engaging with digitally. It does continue to grow, as you might imagine, as we're continuing to make enhancements to the website, to the app, and really as we're delivering more relevancy to members through those channels. And so we are continuing to see growth. We did share in the prepared remarks that traffic was up 24% during the quarter on the website, and it was up even higher than that in the 40% plus range on the app during the quarter. So we continue to be pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in digital engagement with our members.\nOur expectation would be that digital sales, as we define it, would continue to grow at a faster pace over the longer-term than our average sales overall as more members engage digitally. We're able to use some of those targeted personalized communication tools to really help members see the relevancy of all the offers that we have online, but also to use those channels to help drive higher engagement into the warehouse as well, and really creating a seamless experience across the channels.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nVery excited about what we have coming in the app. I mean, more engagement, more locking in the brick-and-mortar business with the virtual digital business as well. And as we continue to roll out enhancements, we've got pay ahead for the pharmacy coming. We've got ordering cakes and deli trays online coming. So many of the things that we've heard from our members that could be a little bit clunky are now moving to a digital state. And we're seeing great adoption right out of the chute. So we continue to, we see some upside to the continued growth and the digital value of having the app and using the digital membership card, the Costco wallet. Those things have all got a very nice roadmap the next 12 months. And we see that number is going to hopefully continue to outpace the growth of the warehouse.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nSure. Hey, guys. Two real estate questions. A lot of opportunity internationally. What does the pipeline look like both in some of your European countries and Asia? I know it takes a while. And then secondly, you mentioned remodels, which I don't think you haven't talked about too much. What is the remodel philosophy in the US? How many do you do? What's the extent of that? What's the lift? I don't know how impactful that is. Thank you.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nDo you want to? I can start. You know, good runway internationally. We see some good growth in Europe, especially in Spain and the UK. We have got a lot of good things going on there. And we see that those two countries will be ramping up. We continue to see very, very good strength in Asia. And so that market, we see the next five years, we think that those projects do, like you mentioned, do take a little bit longer, but they're going to start coming to fruition. So we'll see a good balance. We've been about 50-50, half of the expansion in the US and half outside of the US. And now we're seeing even more opportunities in Canada, North America, and Mexico. So a good balance, about half of the 30 should be outside the US, we see in the next five years.\nExpansions and relocations, we normally do about five to six relocations a year. The uplift is dramatic when we do these. We normally are moving a building that is underserving the market and goes into a larger facility, better parking. If we have a gas station, expanded gas or we add gas to it. And a wide variety of uptake to extreme 50% to 60% increases when you add a gas station and really add a lot of parking to a 20% uplift to a building that had everything just got into a better facility. So we strategically look at that. And then we are continuously investing in our current warehouses too to make sure that we're updating the Fresh foods areas. We're bringing the new ancillary businesses in there. So it's a process we go through every year of planning ahead.\nWe look out several years and a good combination of all three: new locations, relocations, and taking care of the existing buildings that we're doing business in as well. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to go back to the comments on SG&A leverage. So it sounds like this quarter higher healthcare costs prevented your team from leveraging costs. So just curious about the dynamics there. And then as you think about productivity, just how do you think about the runway there? It sounds like it could continue for a few more quarters. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. Yes, you've summarized it pretty well, actually, from how we looked at the quarter. You know, if I just take a step back, there were kind of four main sort of headwinds or investments, if you like, that we had during the quarter when you think about the impact on the warehouses. The first, of course, is the investments that we make through our employee agreement each year. So that was the March 25 agreement. That, on an incremental basis, was sort of mid-single digits headwind that the team had to kind of overcome in improving productivity. The second was, of course, the extended operating hours that we implemented in June. Then you mentioned it, that we had higher healthcare costs in the quarter. We've generally seen, of course, healthcare costs increasing.\nThis was perhaps the first quarter where we've seen healthcare costs grow at a faster pace than our sales. So we saw a little bit of a headwind overall from healthcare costs in the quarter. And then we also had the four basis points impact from the tax charge that relates back to multiple years ago that we took during the quarter as well. So overall, we were one basis point negative on productivity. If we'd have not had the sort of sales and use tax charge that we had during the quarter and without the healthcare costs, we'd have been sort of a mid-single digit or so positive leverage during the quarter without those sort of factors. Now, I would say as you look forward, you know, we're still going to have, of course, the continued investment that we've already implemented around wages.\nSo we have to continue to support those costs. We've implemented the extended opening hours. We think the operators did a great job of absorbing that, as you've seen the last couple of quarters. The healthcare costs, you know, that's something we're taking action to make sure that we're comfortable with the trends that we're seeing. But of course, there's possibilities those costs could continue to be higher in the future. We wouldn't expect to have the sort of the four basis points impact that we had from tax. So I think when you take all those things and look at it going forward, you know, we've historically said that we need to get to about mid-single digit sales to be able to leverage SG&A.\nI think with the work the team's done to offset extended operating hours, the work the team's done to offset the employee agreement, I think we're in that kind of ballpark. Actually, in the first quarter, had we not have had the adjustment for sales tax, I think we'd have actually seen some leverage during the quarter. I think that's the way to sort of think about it overall.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you, Gary. Oh, sorry.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, thanks. Gary, I think you mentioned that inflation was running similar. I just wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. It was up low single digits in general merchandise. Was food inflationary or not in the quarter? And how do you see that trending?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYes. Food and Fresh food and sodas and Fresh eggs would have been slightly inflationary. So low to mid-single digits, no real change really from last quarter. There are quite a few puts and takes in there, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, that you've got a few of the commodities that would be inflationary right now when you look at items like beef, seafood, and coffee. But then you've got produce, which is deflationary currently. And there are other items like eggs and cheese, which are still inflationary year-over-year, but at lower inflation than they were earlier in the year. So you've got kind of puts and takes that are offsetting each other, which really essentially sort of levels it all out at the same level as it was the last couple of quarters.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nWould it be fair to say that most of the ticket growth in comp was driven by inflation?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nI think there'd be a combination of both in there. We'd have, you know, and I remember for us, there's inflation for us, the way we measure it would be, it could be the members buying a bigger pack size, or it could be the members buying an upgraded item of a newer electronic or appliance. So I think you kind of have to look at it. There's sort of probably a combination, or there is a combination of some level of natural inflation on like-for-like items, some level of inflation of members buying bigger pack sizes and increasing, you know, moving to the newer model, if you like, and then some level of unit growth as well in there.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGot it. That's great. Good luck and have a great holiday.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThank you. You too.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Good afternoon, Ron and Gary. I wanted to dig into total paid members. You've had remarkable growth over the last, you know, few years. Models obviously resonated. And 5%, you know, this quarter is still very good. But it has slowed a little over the last few quarters. I was wondering if you could just maybe discuss, you know, what you're seeing there. Is that more so in the US? And then have you seen any stabilization in that? I think the math would kind of suggest that maybe, you know, exit rate lower than 5.2. So just thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Ed. Yeah. You know, membership, as you mentioned, in general, we've been really pleased with the results that we've seen in the quarter with the new members and the younger population that we're recruiting, the acceleration in upgrades, and overall growth that you mentioned just over 5% and Exec up 9%. So we're pleased with the results that we've seen overall. I think your point's accurate that if you look at the year-over-year growth, it has slowed a little bit from where it's been over the last couple of years. And I think some of that's starting to cycle some strong growth in the last year or so. But we still feel really good about the health of the membership growth. And we think there's a lot of continued opportunities to maintain that growth in the future.\nI know Ron mentioned a few of them in one of the questions we answered earlier, but with, you know, partly with the existing warehouses that we're, I think we're in a good position where every year we've been opening 20 to 30 warehouses. And we can see the maturity curve of the increase in the number of members that sign up as warehouses mature. We're obviously opening new warehouses each year. And in particular, to your point in international, we tend to see a much higher number of new member signups. And as that mix continues to blend out to sort of closer to 50-50 between international and the US, we do think with the actions that we're taking, as I mentioned also earlier on the call around improving renewal rates, there's an opportunity to, you know, to help that trend as well.\nThen, you know, we're committed to continuing to improve the value of the membership. We've made obviously some major changes recently with the extended opening hours, the Instacart benefits, and 5% gas on the credit card. But we'll continue to look for ways to add greater membership value. So I think it's accurate to say that it's a little bit slower than it has been, but we feel good about the momentum and the opportunity to continue to grow.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Ed.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. So on the non-food side of things, I think your comp, it's now in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Can you just update us on when you expect to end that, the tough comps from the gift card sales? And does that timing coincide with the tax refunds or the incremental ones that consumers are going to get, especially middle- to higher-income consumers early next year? Will you start to see some more outsized benefit in that category? Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. I think overall, obviously, we generally don't provide sort of comments on forward-looking what we would expect. I think what we would say around Non-Foods is that the team's done a great job of continuing to deliver exciting items at great value and quality. We see, while we have, I think your comment is accurate, that the growth year-over-year has come down to low double digits into that mid-single digit range. I think you've heard us mention before and you referenced it, that some of that really is starting to cycle the impact of gold being sold in warehouse and online, and also some of the gift card programs that we had last year. But overall, we still see good market share gains in really pretty much all of the non-food categories.\nAnd we saw, you may have heard us mention in the prepared comments, that gold and jewelry, special events, health and beauty, were all double digits. We also saw high single-digit growth in Majors, in tires and small appliances. And I didn't mention apparel during the call earlier, but that's also showing really strong improvement in sales momentum and comp growth as well. So I think our perspective on Non-Foods is that we think our teams are doing a really good job in delivering great value for the member. And we think we have a clear path to continue to grow our market share in Non-Foods by continuing to deliver on that promise to our members. And that's really where our focus is.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYou too. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Thanks for the time. I guess another question on warehouse expansion. What are your latest thoughts around long-term warehouse potential, both in the US and in total? And then second, I think all the lower price examples you gave were Kirkland products. So are most of your heaviest price investments on your private brand products? Thanks.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. On the first part of the question, Scot, I think Ron briefly alluded to it earlier as well. You know, we tend to look 5 to 10 years out in terms of our real estate plans. And we would still see a really good roadmap for 30-plus warehouses a year is the goal that we have. At least achieving 30 new warehouses a year is the goal that we've set for ourselves. And when we look at that 5 to 10-year plan, we see opportunities for growth in all the markets and geographies that we're operating in today. So generally speaking, we're expecting around half, maybe slightly over half, to be in the US and then just around half to slightly under a half to be in the rest of the markets that we operate in.\nSo think of that being Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, Australia across those different markets. And I wouldn't say it's, you know, one specific geography. It's really fairly well spread across those markets to continue to build our presence in each of those different geographies. On the second part of your question around Kirkland Signature, you know, I think it's more a reflection of, you know, we tend to have obviously a very strong understanding of the cost involved in those items. And we want to be always the first to lower prices for our members and the last to increase them. And so buyers and our category managers who look at those items, whenever we see an opportunity either to work with our partners or to find ways to buy more effectively, we want to be looking for those opportunities.\nIn most of those cases, that's us really working very closely with our suppliers to look at what we're seeing in the cost base and working creatively to either increase our buying globally so that we can improve our economies of scale or looking at ways to operate more efficiently without ever compromising on the quality of the item. Those would be all great examples of where our teams really looked and found opportunities to bring down the price and increase the value for our members.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. And happy holidays.\n\nRon Vachris\n\nPresident and CEO, Costco Wholesale\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Scot. You too.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, everyone. Thanks for the question. Regarding the personalization efforts, those seem to be working pretty well early on. How much further does that have to roll out? Is it hitting every member at this point? And any specific examples you can share on the conversion or the sales uplift that some of these personalization changes are helping with today?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. We've been, we have been pleased, as you heard Ron mention in the comments around the progress that we made on personalization, where we really are now starting to use our membership data to look for ways, how can we really make the experience better for the member? How do we improve the convenience for them? How do we help them see the most relevant messages that help them get to the best value from Costco? You know, I still think there's plenty of roadmap and opportunity for us to continue to improve. First of all, you know, we're relatively early on the journey. So we're learning what do our members really like? Where are the places we can fine-tune and improve those communications and the places in which they show up?\nI still think there are a number of elements on our roadmap where we still see parts of the experience that our members have that we can make that personalization more relevant, whether that's the, you know, the items and the order in which they see them on things like the MVM or whether it's the way in which we deliver email communication to our members. We still see a really strong runway to continue to improve. We don't really talk about metrics. I think our focus is much more on how we're driving overall member experience and top-line sales. Some of these things are intended to improve the way the members are able to engage in our warehouses or the way they're able to buy online. We tend to look at it more of, is it driving an improvement in member engagement?\nAnd is that helping drive our digital sales, which we continue to expect to grow at a faster pace overall than our warehouse business? And is it driving more member engagement overall? And we've been really pleased with the results so far on that journey.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question. I was hoping to go back to the topic of renewal rates a little bit. I know you don't prefer to guide or forecast, but I think you did say, Gary, that we might see still a decline in the renewal rates the next few quarters. So I was just wondering if that's a little bit of conservatism because it sounds like you are having some success on mitigating that dynamic. Just wondering if you could comment on that. But also, if you were to pull out that cohort of those younger members, would the membership rates be improving, excluding that? Or can you share any, you know, of a deeper dive on that renewal rate dynamic?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nSure. Yeah. Really, Kelly, the impact that we've been talking about really is attributable to this phenomenon that I've mentioned on the call earlier around as we add in, and it sounds like you fully understand the sort of concept of what's happening with the membership base overall, that as we've brought more of these digitally signed-up members who are generally younger, that just they do renew at a lower rate. So really, the impact that we've talked about the last few quarters on renewal rate is a function of those members moving into the renewal rate overall. So that really is what's driving the, or what has driven the slight decline that we've seen over recent quarters. To your point, our goal obviously is to arrest that decline as quickly as possible.\nAnd certainly, we're encouraged by what we saw this last quarter with the improvements that we made through the more targeted and relevant communication to members who we know have signed up through that channel. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. Our goal is to, you know, to stop that decline and to reverse that decline as quickly as we possibly can. As we're only one quarter into the change that we made, we wanted to flag that, of course, you know, there's still work to be done there. And, you know, we are still at a lower renewal rate on digital signups than we are on warehouse signups. And so our expectation of ourselves is to close that gap as quickly as possible. But we want to be transparent in all that we share that there's still work for us to do.\nAnd you know, there is a possibility the next couple of quarters could still show a slight decline because of the factors that I've mentioned in prior calls.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nThanks, Kelly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Spencer Hanus with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nSpencer Hanus\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood evening. Thanks for the question. Just curious if we could talk about the cadence of comps you saw through November and then into December and how that's informing how the consumer is holding up heading into the holiday from your vantage point. And then are you seeing any trade-down or divergence in performance by customer cohort that is changing how you guys are buying?\n\nGary Millerchip\n\nCFO, Costco Wholesale\n\nYeah. I think, Spencer, thanks for the question. I think, you know, we don't obviously get into talking about specifically our current quarter because we report our sales on a monthly basis. But, you know, overall, I would say we're seeing relative consistency in how our members are shopping. I mentioned it earlier that we've, you know, we have seen month-to-month some, I'll call it bumpiness, if you like, in the sales. But most of that's been attributable to whether it's cycling, port strikes, or consumer uncertainty, one month with tariffs, and then the sales come back the next month. And if we look at the last six months or so, outside of the, you know, the two things that I mentioned around, you know, we've seen continued strong growth in Non-Foods and market share gains, but we have seen a deceleration in Non-Foods.\nI think that that's really been offset when you look at the total comps by the benefit we've seen from extended operating hours. But net-net, you know, really in that sort of 6.5% range when you look at the last two quarters over the last seven months, really, outside of a couple of months being one slightly above and one slightly below that 6% to 7% growth range. And those months are right next to each other. So when you average out the two, they came in at 6.5% as well. We've been really in that consistent range. So nothing that we call out that we're seeing as a change other than the two factors I just mentioned in terms of member behavior and the way in which we believe our value is resonating with them.\n\nSpencer Hanus\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Got it.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session and today's call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. HPE finished a transformative year with a record quarter of profitable growth and disciplined execution. Q4 revenue of $9.7 billion increased 14% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating profits growing faster, up 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record high at 12.2%, including server around 10% and networking at 23%, matching the high end of our expectations. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.62 exceeded the high end of our guidance. Stronger profitability also resulted in higher-than-expected free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the quarter, capping a solid fiscal year 2025 performance. The underlying demand environment was strong throughout the quarter, with orders growing faster than revenues. We saw an acceleration in orders in the last weeks of the quarter, signaling solid demand for our portfolio.\nThe strong finish, coupled with the steps we have taken throughout the year to transform our company, positions us well in 2026. Reflecting our continued confidence and ongoing technology leadership, we are raising our fiscal year 2026 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance and the midpoint of free cash flow guidance. Marie will provide more details about our Q4 financial results and our new fiscal year 2026 outlook in a moment. We intend to capture the opportunity in 2026 and beyond by pursuing the key priorities we outlined at the securities analyst meeting in October. These are building a new networking industry leader, profitably capturing the AI infrastructure build-out opportunity, accelerating our high-margin software and services growth through our GreenLake cloud, capitalizing on the unstructured data market growth with our leading Alletra MP storage offerings, and driving the transition to our next-generation server platforms.\nThis strategy underpins our long-term financial framework. By fiscal year 2028, we are committed to generating at least $3 in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and more than $3.5 billion in free cash flow with improved cash conversion cycles. I also want to highlight that we recently announced agreements regarding our H3C stake in China. We will sell our remaining 19% stake for approximately $1.4 billion, which we expect to close during the first half of calendar year 2026. These transactions support our plan to reduce our net leverage to around 2x by the end of fiscal year 2027. Looking back at fiscal year 2025, I am proud of what a transformative year it was for our company. We celebrated our 10-year anniversary at the a decade of focus innovation technology leadership.\nWe completed the acquisition of Juniper Networks, strengthening our position in the networking market to create a new industry leader. We scaled our GreenLake cloud, hybrid cloud software, Alletra MP storage, and AI businesses to new heights, and we continue to improve our cost structure through our catalyst initiatives to operate more efficiently. Overall, HPE delivered full-year revenue of $34.3 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year. Our revenue growth reflects solid performance across our three largest business segments and the addition of Juniper Networks. We exceeded our full-year outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow, delivering $1.94 and $986 million, respectively. Networking played a pivotal role in our success. Segment revenue increased 51% in fiscal year 2025, achieving $6.9 billion, with the addition of four months of Juniper results.\nOrders for the new combined networking segment grew at a faster rate than revenues in fiscal year 2025 as the market recovered. We saw strong double-digit order and revenue growth across our key segments of the networking market on an as-reported basis. Regarding the integration of Juniper, I am pleased with the significant progress we have made in forming a new unified leader in networking. In the five months since closing the transaction, we have brought together our teams, technologies, and go-to-market strategies, and the response from our employees, customers, partners, and the industry at large has been overwhelmingly positive. They are already seeing the benefits of our combined portfolio, the innovation we are driving, and the cohesive customer experience we now deliver.\nAcross the industry, stakeholders have expressed enthusiasm for combined company ability to accelerate innovation, deliver greater value, and help organizations build secure, modern, and high-performance networks for the future. The new combined networking team is performing exceptionally well. We increased orders and revenues on a pro forma basis during the first full quarter as one team. As a combined company, we are able to better compete with our comprehensive industry-leading networking portfolio. We saw good traction with our core customer segments, enterprise and service provider. As we integrate Juniper Networks and HPE Aruba Networking, we are building a modern, secure, AI-native networking portfolio, one that encompasses campus and branch, data center switching, routing, and security. By combining our unique strengths in AIOps, Agentic AI, Silicon IP, and go-to-market scale, we are positioning HPE to capture greater market share and revenue synergies.\nOur networks for AI solutions grew in fiscal year 2025, where we saw notable strength in both WAN and data center switching. We are on track to achieve networking for AI cumulative order target of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2026. The campus and branch business had a strong performance in fiscal year 2025, with revenue up double digits, with orders growing above revenues. Our AI for network solutions leverage both Mist AI large language models and Aruba Agentic AI models, driving clear differentiation that is resonating with our customers. In our server segment, fiscal year 2025 revenue grew 10% year-over-year. We signed $6.8 billion in new AI system orders in fiscal year 2025. Sovereign and enterprise bookings now account for more than 60% of the cumulative orders since Q1 of fiscal year 2023, demonstrating our strategy to prioritize profitable AI infrastructure build-out opportunities.\nIn traditional servers, revenue grew double digits year-over-year, benefiting from a refreshed cycle as customers upgrade to the latest generation 11 and 12 servers. These support greater workload performance with quantum-proof security, higher density, and lower power consumption. I am pleased that we have returned server operating margin to approximately 10% in Q4. As we look to 2026, we will draw on our supply chain expertise to secure critical commodity supply and exercise our pricing management discipline. We expect DRAM and NAND costs to continue to increase in 2026, the majority of which we expect to pass to the market while monitoring demand. Hybrid cloud revenue grew 5% in fiscal year 2025. We added approximately 7,000 new customers to GreenLake, ending the year with approximately 46,000 customers. Total company ARR was $3.2 billion, up 62% year-over-year, with additional Juniper.\nWe continue to differentiate ourselves in a market with unique cloud-native software, AIOps, and services, which together represented over 80% of ARR. In storage, we continue to make excellent progress in shifting our portfolio to our own IP. We closed the year with strong demand for HPE Alletra MP, with four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in both orders and revenue. We have now shipped over 7,400 Alletra MP storage arrays, more than doubling year-over-year. We added more than 1,300 new customers in fiscal year 2025, further solidifying our leadership in this space. Demand for our newer differentiated Private Cloud solutions, Private Cloud AI, and Private Cloud for virtualization with our HPE Morpheus VM Essentials Software ramped throughout the year. We set new milestones, including approximately 100 new PC AI customers.\nTotal orders for our Private Cloud solutions, which also includes Private Cloud business edition and Private Cloud enterprise offerings, increased more than 20% year-over-year. HPE is proud to have been named a leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Infrastructure Platform Consumption Services, positioned highest in execution and furthest in vision. These acknowledgments spotlight our innovative cloud-native software and services experience, which helped customers accelerate transformation and drive operational efficiency across their hybrid IT environments. This week, more than 5,000 attendees participated in our HPE Discover Barcelona customer and partner event. We introduced new innovations and demonstrated the considerable progress we have made in bringing together HPE and Juniper in a short period of time.\nFor example, in AI for Networks, we announced new AIOps capabilities and common infrastructure products that deliver a consistent self-driving experience across both HPE Aruba Networking Central and HPE Juniper Networking Mist cloud platforms. This is an important milestone in achieving a unified experience across campus and branch, and demonstrates our commitment to quickly cross-pollinating our platforms and driving common infrastructure products for investment protection. In Networks for AI, we announced the first OEM switch to leverage Broadcom Tomahawk 6 Silicon. To address performance-hungry computing for AI inferencing, our new HPE Juniper Networking data center switch connects GPUs within data centers with the world's highest performance Ultra Ethernet transport-ready switch, delivering 102.4 Tb per second total capacity.\nOur new HPE Juniper multi-service edge router brings AI inferencing closer to the source of data generation, with performance up to 1.6 Tb per second with full duplex 400 Gb per second connectivity. Also, in Barcelona, we extended the NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE portfolio, introducing new solutions for AI factory scale and performance. In HPE's AI factory networking solutions, we introduced the new HPE Juniper Networking Edge on-ramp and long-haul data center interconnect with our HPE Juniper Networking MX and PTX high-speed routing platforms. Integrating our Juniper routing solutions with NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet Networking and NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs enables high-speed, secure, and efficient edge on-ramp and AI data center interconnect use cases. We also announced the first AMD Helios AI rack scale architecture with integrated HPE Juniper Scale-up Ethernet Networking.\nThe solution leverages purpose-built HPE Juniper Networking data center infrastructure and software to accelerate performance and deployment of at-scale AI training and inferencing for cloud service providers and sovereign clouds. In storage, we announced new solutions to accelerate AI data pipelines. The new HPE Alletra Storage MP X10,000 Data Intelligent nodes transform the X10,000 into an active data layer that enriches data in real time for AI pipelines. Finally, last month at Supercomputing 2025, we demonstrated our next-generation liquid-cooled Cray GX and supercomputing platform at data center scale. We have already won contracts to build five large sovereign systems utilizing this technology, including a second-generation exascale AI supercomputer for the United States Department of Energy. These announcements highlight the strength of our innovation to deliver the best networking, AI, and cloud solutions for our customers and partners.\nAs I reflect on the past year, I want to highlight a few critical milestones we have achieved as a company. First, we repositioned our business, creating a new networking leader by combining the strengths of HPE Aruba Networking and Juniper Networks. Second, we scaled our AI business with focus on sovereign and enterprise customers, representing more than 60% of our bookings. Third, we advanced our cloud business with innovative offerings such as our own Alletra MP storage for both structured and unstructured data, CloudOps suite software, HPE Morpheus Enterprise VM Essentials, and Private Cloud AI, which are all underpinned by our GreenLake cloud scale and experience. And lastly, we continue to improve our cost structure through our catalyst initiatives to operate more efficiently by leveraging automation and new AI technologies. We enter fiscal 26 with a world-class portfolio and a stronger market position.\nNetworking, cloud, and AI remain the three pillars of our strategy. Our organic investments are focused on higher margin opportunities, and with a disciplined approach to the Juniper integration, we are positioned to accelerate value for shareholders. On behalf of the HPE Management Team, I want to thank our customers, partners, and team members for their dedication this year. Your support has been instrumental in making fiscal 2025 a transformative year for HPE. We look forward to successfully executing on our strategy to achieve our fiscal 2026 and long-term plan commitments to our shareholders. With that, I will hand it over to Marie for a detailed review of Q4 financial results and our outlook for Q1 and the full fiscal year 2026.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal year 2025 has been a transformative year for HPE.\nWe took significant strides towards aligning with our long-term strategy, delivering on our commitments, and positioning the company for sustainable growth. We closed the acquisition of Juniper Networks, our largest ever, which has expanded our reach into the data center and significantly bolstered our scale in the networking sector. The integration of Juniper is a top priority, and I'm pleased to share that our execution is progressing well. While it's early days, the initial synergies we are seeing are encouraging, reaffirming our belief in the potential of this acquisition to drive higher margin and higher growth opportunities for HPE. We have established a robust foundation to transform our cost structure through catalyst initiatives, which, combined with the synergies from Juniper, are targeting approximately $1 billion in annualized structural savings by fiscal 2028. We are pleased with the significant catalyst-related cost reductions we captured in fiscal 2025.\nWe exceeded our target of achieving 20% of $350 million in annual run rate cost savings as our results track ahead of plan. As part of Catalyst, we continue to optimize and streamline our portfolio to become a more agile and efficient organization. Turning to fiscal year 2025, total revenue reached $34.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.94, and free cash flow was $986 million, exceeding the outlook ranges provided at our securities analyst meeting in October. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was a loss of $0.04, below our outlook range, primarily driven by accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Juniper and treatment of preferred stock. We returned $886 million to our common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to delivering value to our investors.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses of $7.5 billion increased 11% year-over-year and declined 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Excluding Juniper, non-GAAP operating expense was down modestly year-over-year, driven by ongoing cost management initiatives. Let me highlight some key segment-related metrics from our fiscal 2025 results. Networking emerged as a standout performer of the year. The acquisition of Juniper was instrumental in driving this success, particularly in our WAN business. Overall, networking orders were up strong double digits year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Meanwhile, our AI server business also had good traction, with orders totaling $6.8 billion for the fiscal year and cumulative AI orders since Q1 fiscal 2023 reaching $13.4 billion. Additionally, we saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in Alletra MP storage orders, signaling momentum as we focus on HPE-developed intellectual property and innovation. Now, let me walk you through our Q4 performance.\nRevenue for Q4 was $9.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, coming in slightly below the low end of our outlook range due primarily to the push-out of some AI shipments. This growth was primarily driven by our acquisition of Juniper Networks and robust performance in the HPE Aruba Networking, partially offset by declines in server and hybrid cloud revenue. Our Q4 profitability was another highlight of the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin reached a record 36%, driven by a favorable mixture to networking, stable gross margins across our three largest business segments, and disciplined pricing strategies. Non-GAAP operating expenses rose 40% year-over-year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Juniper. Excluding Juniper, non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to streamline our cost structure and maintain disciplined management of discretionary spending.\nNon-GAAP operating margin expanded to 12%, an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year and 370 basis points sequentially. These improvements were supported by our catalyst cost savings and Juniper synergies. For the quarter, our non-GAAP diluted net EPS was $0.62, exceeding the high end of our guidance, while GAAP diluted net EPS was $0.11. The difference reflects the exclusion of certain items, including amortization of intangible assets, Juniper-related acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, and cost reduction plan expense, partially offset by adjustments for taxes and other adjustments. Our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, grew by 62% year-over-year, reaching $3.2 billion. This growth reflects the strength of our GreenLake platform, the accelerating adoption of our software solutions, and the incremental contributions from Juniper. GreenLake continues to grow its footprint, adding around 2,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately 46,000 customers by year-end.\nI'm particularly pleased with our Q4 free cash flow of $1.9 billion, well above our expectations, bolstered by strong Juniper collections and better-than-expected profitability. Now, let me provide some color by segment, starting with networking, which is the cornerstone of our transformation strategy. HPE is uniquely positioned to lead in the networking market, offering an industry-leading secure AI-native networking portfolio that spans campus and branch, data center switching, routing, and security solutions. In Q4, networking generated revenue of $2.8 billion, representing a 150% year-over-year increase and a 62% sequential growth. Q4 revenue benefited from the first full quarter contribution of Juniper results, alongside continued growth in our HPE Aruba Networking business. We saw double-digit growth performed year-over-year across WAN, campus and branch, and security. We are particularly encouraged by the profitability of this newly consolidated networking business, which delivered an operating margin of 23%.\nWhile this represents a 140 basis point decline year-over-year, it marks a 220 basis point improvement quarter over quarter, driven by robust gross margin performance and higher revenue. Although we will not report Juniper's results separately going forward, we are pleased to note that integration synergies have already been materializing, enabling Juniper to deliver an eight-year high in operating profit margin during Q4. We remain focused on continuing to unlock the value of this integration. We are combining our two networking sales teams into a unified organization and implementing a new sales coverage model to drive efficiency and alignment. Starting in January, we will also introduce a unified sales compensation plan, promoting consistency across the integrated networking team. These actions position us well to build on the momentum we have established and capitalize on the significant market opportunities ahead. Moving to our server business.\nIn Q4, server revenue totaled $4.5 billion, representing a 5% decline year-over-year and a 10% sequential decrease. This performance primarily reflects the timing of AI server shipments during the quarter and lower-than-expected US federal spending. Despite these headwinds, we were encouraged by robust server order growth across both traditional server and AI offerings, with demand significantly outpacing revenue in this period. Momentum in traditional server was driven by the continued shift toward next-generation platforms, which contributed to higher average selling prices. Our Gen 11 and Gen 12 platforms now comprise approximately 98% of our traditional server revenue mix. As we look ahead, we will maintain a disciplined focus on balancing profitability and unit growth for our traditional server business, emphasizing volume and services attached to support sustainable long-term cash flow.\nTurning to AI systems, orders were strong in the Q4, reaching $1.9 billion, largely fueled by demand for sovereign customers. Additionally, our AI server pipeline remains multiples of our backlog, underscoring the substantial interest we are seeing from sovereign and enterprise customers. It is worth noting that we expect AI demand to remain uneven, as some of our larger sovereign customers are placing orders with extended lead times, which may defer shipments to future periods. We successfully delivered an operating margin of approximately 10%, consistent with our outlook. We improved our margin performance by 340 basis points sequentially, a result of our disciplined approach to managing AI volumes, executing on traditional server pricing, and reducing operating expenses. Moving to our hybrid cloud segment, we reported revenue of $1.4 billion for the quarter, reflecting a 13% decline year-over-year and a 5% decline sequentially.\nWhile below our outlook for flattish revenue quarter over quarter, this performance reflected our strategy to sharpen our focus on higher margin HPE-developed solutions while intentionally reducing our exposure to low-margin non-IP-related businesses. As part of this strategic pivot, we are encouraged by the continued momentum in our innovative offerings. Orders for Alletra MP grew strong double digits year-over-year, underscoring the growing traction of this solution in the market. We are also seeing good growth in Private Cloud AI orders, which more than doubled sequentially, and we closed the year with approximately 100 new logos in this space. Hybrid cloud operating margin for the quarter came in at 5%, representing a 280 basis points decline year-over-year, and a 90 basis points decline sequentially. This reduction primarily reflects the scaling of operating expenses as we continue to invest in innovative and transformative solutions.\nTurning to financial services, our financial services business delivered $889 million in revenue, roughly flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Financing volumes totaled $1.5 billion, reflecting consistent demand within the segment. Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 12%, up 230 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points quarter over quarter, driven by a favorable lease portfolio mix and lower bad debt levels. Our Q4 loss ratio held steady at approximately 0.5%, while return on equity reached 21%, our highest level in over five years. These results underscore the strength and resilience of our financial services portfolio. For the quarter, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, reinforcing our disciplined approach to financial management. Generating robust free cash flow and successfully integrating Juniper remain top priorities as we execute our fiscal 2026 strategy.\nOur Q4 cash conversion cycle improved last quarter by five days to 30 days. This was driven by a decrease in days receivable, largely due to strong collections for Juniper, including early payments and a decrease in days of inventory due to lower purchases, offset by a decrease in days payable due to higher vendor payments. Inventory ended the year at $6.4 billion, reflecting a 19% decrease year-over-year and an 11% sequential decline. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, we returned $171 million through dividends to common shareholders and an additional $100 million via share repurchases. At the same time, we reinforced our financial strength by improving our pro forma net leverage ratio from 3.1 to 2.7 times, primarily due to an enhanced cash position resulting in a net paydown of $2 billion of term loan debt.\nIn terms of portfolio optimization, as announced previously, we are selling the entirety of our remaining interest in H3C in transactions valued at $1.4 billion, subject to regulatory review and approval. We expect to conclude both sales in H1 2026 and intend to use the proceeds to further deleverage our balance sheet, aligning with our strategic objective of maintaining a strong and flexible financial position. Before I get into the details of our guidance, let me first address the industry-wide commodity cost inflationary environment and provide some context around the actions we are taking. We are monitoring the DRAM and NAND markets daily and taking mitigating actions to preserve our margins. This includes partnering with our suppliers, taking pricing actions, and working with our customers to shape demand.\nOverall, we expect to pass through the majority of component cost increases while monitoring demand elasticity with our customers. These dynamics are factored into our outlook with our server business most exposed, followed by storage, and then networking. We will continue to focus on what we can control while navigating the environment as it evolves. Turning to our FY26 outlook, we are reaffirming our revenue growth outlook range of 17% to 22 on a reported basis or 5% to 10 on a constant currency basis, as was provided at our securities analyst meeting. We expect our revenue mix to be approximately 46% in the first half and 54% in the second half, which is a bit more back-ended than our typical seasonality given the composition of our AI server backlog and pipeline.\nWe are raising our full-year networking revenue growth outlook to 65% to 70 on a reported basis, implying approximately $11 billion, as we see strong traction in the marketplace for our combined portfolio. The approximately $11 billion in revenue now translates to a mid-single-digit growth on a pro forma basis. Our FY25 pro forma baseline shifted approximately $300 million related to the move-out of non-core assets to corporate and other, aligned with our restated financials for the new segmentation effective 1 November 2025. We are optimistic about our networking outlook with the commencement of our sales day one on 1 January when we combine our sales forces. We will update you on our progress as we move through the integration.\nWe expect operating profit margin in the low 20% range, driven by top-line growth and our cost optimization initiatives, resulting in networking constituting greater than 50% of our total operating profit for the year. We are reaffirming our cloud and AI revenue growth outlook of mid-single to low double-digit rate growth and operating margin of 7% to 9%. Given the increasing mix of sovereign customers and our AI backlog, we expect the majority of the backlog to be realized in the second half and beyond. We remain focused on prioritizing profitable server growth, implementing pricing actions to counter rising commodity costs while balancing the shift to higher margin-owned IP. We are raising our fiscal 2026 non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range to $2.25 to 2.45. We expect to recognize approximately 53% of EPS in the second half.\nOur revised outlook for seasonality versus what we provided at SAM reflects the rapidly shifting component environment. We now also expect a higher GAAP diluted net EPS range of $0.62 to 0.82. These estimates reflect a fully diluted share count of $1.44 billion, non-GAAP tax rate of 14%, and OINE of approximately $650 million. In addition, given faster-than-expected benefits from the integration of Juniper, we are raising the midpoint of our FY26 free cash flow outlook and now expect a range of $1.7 to 2 billion, which includes approximately $700 million in costs related to the Juniper and Catalyst programs. Our slightly increased cash expense outlook reflects accelerated implementation of Catalyst-related initiatives at FY26. For Q1, we expect total revenue will be between $9 and 9.4 billion, with sequential revenue decline roughly in line with historic seasonality.\nFor networking, we expect revenue to grow 145% to 155 year-over-year on an as-reported basis or the high end of our updated platform revenue growth target range of mid-single digits. This growth is driven by strength in our backlog and Juniper seasonality. We expect continued strength in the business and synergy realization to drive an operating margin rate in line with our full-year guidance. In cloud and AI, we continue to see the impact of lumpiness in AI server revenue and expect a sequential decline in the AI server revenue, with the majority of AI deals shipping in the latter half of the year. Given the expected mix shift towards traditional server and benefits from recent pricing actions, we expect operating margins for cloud and AI to be slightly above the high end of our FY26 target range.\nOn a consolidated basis, we expect Q1 total operating expense to decrease sequentially. Combined with our commodity cost pricing mitigations, we expect our non-GAAP total operating margin rate to be up slightly sequentially. Consequently, we expect non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.57 and 0.61 and GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.09 and 0.13. In closing, FY25 was a year of transition for HPE as we repositioned the company for its next phase of growth, completing the integration of Juniper and taking decisive action on our cost structure. There is more work ahead, but we believe we have the right strategy, the right portfolio, and a clear path to making HPE a leaner, more efficient company aligned with the networking, cloud, and AI needs of our customers.\nI'm confident in the opportunity in front of us, and we remain firmly committed to consistent execution and the financial framework that we outlined for profitable growth and strong cash generation. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q&A. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question. The first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYep. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\nI guess if I look at the fiscal 26 EPS free cash flow guide, you folks are kind of raising both those numbers while revenue guide is relatively unchanged. I assume this is just networking mix that's helping you a bit over here. But can you spend just some time talking more about how are you thinking about the memory headwinds in the fiscal guide versus what you were expecting back at SAM? And how do you think this memory cycle ends up being different versus what we saw back in 2017, 2018? That'd be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nWell, good afternoon, Amit. This is Antonio. I will start, and then Marie will provide further details. Look, we are very confident in the new guide we provided, which obviously raises the EPS and the free cash flow.\nIt has to do with a combination of the mix of the business, obviously, networking revenue increased now to the mid-single digits, and the continuous actions that we take across the company. Right? catalyst is slightly ahead of what we want it to be. But net-net, the driver of this is all the execution that we have seen now in Juniper. Now we are a networking-centric company. Clearly drives all of that. And then on the component side, look, it looks a little bit like the early part of the COVID timeframe is all about the allocation of supply as we go forward. That drives cost increases. We already, by the way, Amit, have implemented price increases in the month of November. So that's already in place. And we have very strong capabilities in our supply chain to secure the allocation of components we need.\nWe have discipline in passing through the cost through our pricing, which, again, we already did in November. Everything we know as of today is in our guide. So what we know today is already included in the guide for both revenue and EPS.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nAnd Amit, good afternoon. Maybe I'll just add just to clarify on the guide itself. So you're correct. We did raise the guide, the midpoint, by $0.05. And that's actually driven by the revenue that moved out of Q4 into Q1. So we've got some profit benefit there. And also, as you correctly said, some of the stronger networking backlog that we're seeing. So overall, look at the prudent guide. If we can do better, we will. And we're pleased with the cash flow as well.\nI think that's a great example of just some of the strengths that we saw in Juniper collections in Q4 because we had very good cash flow in Q4. And that's actually trickling through into 2026 as well. So overall, they're the two drivers of the increases in the guides, Amit.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nVery good. Thank you, Amit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Antonio, just following up on the response to Amit's question, you did talk about acceleration in orders towards the end of the quarter, and you're referring to price increases in November.\nMaybe if you can just sort of help us in terms of how you're interpreting the increase in orders that you saw towards the end of the quarter, and do you see sort of them largely being in response to price actions you were going to take in November? Just trying to understand what the drivers are, what you're seeing at your end. Thank you.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. Thank you, Samik. We saw a very linear quarter in Q4. And in the last few weeks, we saw an acceleration of that. And it's true across the entire portfolio. Look, we closed the Q1 as a full integrated networking business. The commodity cost has limited impact in the networking business because, obviously, DRAM and NAND are not really applicable to the networking business. And that business did really, really well. We saw orders growing faster than the revenue there.\nThen we saw continued momentum in our Alletra MP storage with double-digit year-over-year growth in both orders and revenues. The traditional server business orders did well. It's early to say if there was a pull-in of sorts on demand, but I will tell you that we felt prudent at this point in time, considering the early signals we got from our suppliers on DRAM, to take the actions on pricing. We expect that the NAND part will follow in 2026, and therefore we will do the same. The customers obviously have budgets that end on 31 December. Most of the customers are on calendar year budgets. You should normally expect an acceleration of orders in the last part of the year.\nBut we have conversations with customers about what we expect on commodities so they can make the right decisions and place the right orders. We really focus on conversion short-term versus guaranteeing pricing long-term because, obviously, all our agreements have price protection. And therefore, we will be very upfront with customers when to place the orders and what to expect in terms of supply.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nVery good. Thank you, Samik. All right, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask on the ARR and the GreenLake side if I could. Could you just talk a little bit about traction you're seeing with the as-a-service models more broadly? And then, obviously, the ARR jumped up a little bit with Juniper Mist being added.\nIf you could just talk a little bit about what adding Juniper does to this part of the model. Does this help maybe accelerate, obviously, the networking part? But are there any broader benefits by having the two companies combined on the GreenLake side? Thank you.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. Look, all the ARR we added from Juniper is in the software subscription services. Because, remember, our ARR is a combination of, call it the SaaS, which is the software subscription on GreenLake. And that's a combination of networking with Aruba Central, obviously all the hybrid cloud software with Morpheus, VM Essentials, Zerto, OpsRamp, and the like. And also the storage business, right, with Alletra MP. And then we have the GreenLake Flex, which is the pure consumption model, which obviously is inclusive of hardware and financing. And the financing is only for the operating leases part of the equation.\nBut the addition of Juniper comes all the software subscription that they are tied to things like Mist and Apstra and so forth. In fact, one of the key announcements we made yesterday when I was in Barcelona is the integration already of Apstra with OpsRamp as a part of GreenLake. That's an acceleration of ARR. But look, we now have a baseline that represents 80% of the ARR is software and services. And that's very, very high. And as we continue to grow the networking business, which now we are at the core, I will argue a networking-centric company with a tremendous amount of innovation. If you look at the innovation this week, it has been significantly higher than any other event we have had in the last few years. Rami came strong and articulated the strategy about cross-pollinating the Mist and Aruba Central.\nThat means both will get the benefits of each other, which means more software added through the AIOps. In addition to the fact now we support dual hardware on both platforms. We also announced the new Juniper QFX fabric, which is first direct liquid cooling. It took advantage of our direct liquid cooling. And that has also a component of software that will go into the subscription. So that's what we're seeing. And so, obviously, now we have a $3.2 billion ARR. And from there, we expect to continue to grow at the bigger base, obviously. And that's where we are excited about what comes next with GreenLake and all the AIOps intelligence we build around it.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Tim. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question.\nAntonio, I'm going to go back to kind of where Amit and Samik were touching on the commodity stuff. I just really want to understand your thoughts on the pass-through and demand elasticity because we can look at server DRAM contract pricing up to 50% in Q4 alone. DRAM is obviously a considerable part of the server bill of materials. I guess simple math would say you'd have to raise pricing 15% just to account for the contract pricing in Q4 alone. So I guess maybe just is that the implication that you're kind of referencing here in second? What are you assuming for demand elasticity? Just because if we take your kind of cloud and AI guide, it does assume a notable acceleration in growth through the year.\nSo, I'd love to just understand: are you talking about pricing increases that considerable, and two, how do you expect demand to respond? Thank you so much.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Erik. I think you're spot on. I think you're not that far, to be honest with you. You may be a little bit short, in fact, I will say. Look, we have made pricing changes to reflect exactly what you say, which is the DRAM cost and the percentage of the mix of that in the BOM in our servers. And we expect that the NAND part of that will follow as we go forward. As for demand elasticity, look, there are benefits to upgrade because we have shown customers that you can take seven generation 10 servers down to one.\nThat helps reduce your energy cost by 65%, get better performance on a per-core basis, more density. And at the same time, you can pay off that investment in less than two years. So the depreciation of that return is very, very fast. So as we said in my remarks, we are going to monitor the cost and the demand. And I think you will see a rebalancing over time between units and revenue. But remember, more than two-thirds of our AUP is structural. So I believe there are unit growth that we'll continue to see, but maybe a little bit more muted than maybe expected six months ago. But on the balance, the revenue will grow as implied in our revenue guidance because of this AUP mix shift. And I think you're spot on in your thesis.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nAnd I'll just add, Erik. Look, we're using multiple tools.\nYou hit on pricing. But also, look, we've been down this track before. We know that other tools like demand shaping are critical to use through this process. So we will be looking at how we can shape demand with the parts that are available while we try to balance some of our key customer relationships. But as Antonio said, our guidance really reflects the best estimate of the impact of commodities and the actions as of now.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nAnd by the way, another point, Erik, is that when we have frame agreements, think about large enterprises that buy on a catalog of pre-configured products. There are price protection guarantees there. So obviously, there is an ability for us to raise prices as a part of the changes we see in the industry.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Erik. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Yes. Thank you. I wanted to clarify some of the comments around seasonality. In your slides, you talk about the $9 to 9.4 billion in Q1 is a decline consistent with historical seasonality. But I think Marie said that there were some push-outs of servers from Q4 to Q1. So should that not be driving much better seasonality and sort of a higher outlook in fiscal Q1? And similarly, you noted that the AI server lumpiness and sort of timing will drive the second half of the fiscal year much higher relative to the first half. It's like different seasonalities. So I'm just trying to piece those pieces together. What's baked in from push-outs into Q1? And would the seasonality have been even worse had those push-outs not occurred? So hopefully, you can just maybe put that all into context. Thank you.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nSure. No problem, Wamsi. So why don't I just clarify the seasonality with respect to Q1? Then I'll turn to Antonio to talk about the AI timing. So with respect to Q1 seasonality, the way to think about it is spot on. We did have some AI deals that moved out of Q4 into Q1. But just bear in mind that from a Q1 perspective, it is in line with our normal sort of historic seasonality for Q1 revenue. So sort of use that as an anchor to think about the year. And I think in the prepared remarks, I did mention that we have a split between revenue of 46% in the first half and 54% in the back half. So use that as another way to sort of think through the seasonality. So hopefully, that gives you the context on Q1.\nAnd then I'm going to sort of turn it to Antonio to talk specifically about the back half and how we see the AI shipments sort of placing themselves throughout the year. Antonio, over to you.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. Wamsi, look, on the AI conversion, right? Because now more than 60% of our orders are in sovereign and enterprise. And obviously, enterprise is a very large number of deals that get through, but they are smaller in size compared to potentially a sovereign AI cloud, which obviously is much larger. But when I think about that, look, they are longer to convert for a number of reasons, right? Number one, obviously, is the whole procurement process is much longer to get the funding locked and so forth. The data center readiness, the availability of power and cooling, and the like. And some of these deals, by the way, are not current technologies.\nMaybe they are for the back half set of technologies, particularly with NVIDIA, AMD, and Juniper. So you have a combination of factors there. In regard to the push-out of the deals, look, there were some deals for the government-related. They take time. They take time to really get the machine up and running again. Remember, we're just now a handful of weeks here since they came back online. That may take an extra full set of weeks. And then there was one particular deal that they weren't ready with the data center. And so we deploy a number of pods, and those other pods will take a number of incremental weeks to get it done. So we expect that the back end of the year will have the biggest part of the AI revenue conversion.\nBut at the same time, we continue to stay focused on those two segments because the focus there is because of our ability to play and win with the right margin profiles and the right working capital.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the networking business. It looks like on a pro forma basis using Juniper's results, you grew kind of in the low to maybe mid-teens range here or near this last quarter. It looks like you're guiding kind of the pro forma number to kind of grow in that mid-single-digit range this next quarter and in that range for the full year. I'm curious of why necessarily you see a deceleration in that. Is that conservatism?\nAnd if you can, can you talk a little bit about Juniper's positioning in some of these AI fabric buildouts, what your discussion's been with customers thus far? I think Juniper's had a position in some larger buildouts in the past. Thank you.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. No worries. Why don't I just talk a little bit about the revenue and how we're thinking about it? Yes, you're right. Look, really pleased with the results, I'd say, for Q4, both in terms of both revenue and operating margins for the business. I think you're seeing the transformative power of those two networking companies coming together and just what we can drive here. What I would say is you think about the rest of the year, we have kept revenue. We did raise revenue, actually, in terms of the range that we gave you for networking.\nA couple of things just to bear in mind. We do have a critical milestone in the integration that's taking place in this current quarter, which is actually the integration of both of the sales forces. It's early days. I think at this point, we've got a prudent outlook given where we're at relative to the integration itself. A couple of things just to bear in mind in terms of drivers. There is some seasonality I mentioned earlier. We see some commodity pressures that you heard us talk about on the call. And then, obviously, we've got the product mix in terms of a bit more cloud and AI. But I'd say overall, we're comfortable with the guide that we've given you so far for networking for the year.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nLook, this is, in my mind, very simple.\nWe have an incredible portfolio in the campus and branch. We continue to make tremendous traction. Both platforms are winning in the market. There is more about integrating the sales force, getting them stabilized from an account coverage perspective. I think the channel will be the opportunity for us to drive upside because they are all super excited about that part of the business. And look, we had major wins on both sides. And so we expect that to continue in 2026. On the data center switches side, we expect that business to grow at or above market as we go forward. Networking for AI, we said we expect to achieve $1.5 billion by the end of 2026. Obviously, some of that will cut into 2027 because you have the backlog conversion that has to take place.\nThe one area that I am actually more excited in many ways is the routing business. The MX platform is the standard for on-ramp cloud. It is an amazing product that really is winning in the market. And even the PTX for the DCI, meaning the data center interconnect for long haul, is the reference. And that business has a very large backlog that will convert later in the year. And Marie referenced to this. I think it's important that all of you remind yourself that Juniper is a back-end loaded conversion to revenue. That has been always the case. And that's why we have given this seasonality in line to also what HP is going to do.\nBut based on what we know today and the line of sight of the integration, and still have to go through the sales integration on 2 January, we still raised the revenue guidance to now call it the mid-single digit, call it the 5+ percent, which is almost double of what we gave you at the security analyst meeting at the midpoint, which was between 2% and 5. So that tells you we are growing confident. And as we go forward, we will see how the team execute. But look, we believe there is a tremendous opportunity. And the goal there is the goal for us is all about execution.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThank you, Aaron. All right. Operator, last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your final question of the day will come from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAsiya Merchant\n\nDirector and Equity Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOh, great. Thank you for squeezing me in here.\nMarie, if I can just ask about the sale of the assets that you have and how that is reflected in your OINE. I believe the OINE figures didn't really change from what you provided as the analyst of it. So how should we think about the sale and how that should be factored into the OINE? Thank you.\n\nMarie Myers Executive\n\nEVP and CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. Yeah. Look, Asiya , at this point, I assume you're talking about H3C. Look, everything's factored into the OINE numbers that I gave in my prepared remarks. We'd actually planned for this all along in 2026. So it's all captured there in the prepared remarks that I gave you in the call today, Asiya . Thank you.\n\nAntonio Neri\n\nPresident and CEO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nYeah. No, thank you. Thank you for the patience today. Look, Marie and I provided a lot of details. We provided a lot of data.\nI'm sure you will have follow-up questions that the IR team will handle. But we felt that this was the right time to give you as much data as possible as we enter 2026. And look, I will say that 2026 is a year where HPE has the opportunity to not only deliver what we committed, but really drive the transformation of this company to a new height based on the fact that we are now a networking-centric company. And on that foundation, with the latest innovation, we will deliver great experiences, growth opportunities in both cloud, and AI. But we will maintain that strong discipline, focus on growth and operating margins that ultimately drive profitable growth and free cash flow. And I believe our strategy is working, and the Juniper integration is working. And so that's what I will leave you today.\nI take this opportunity to thank you for your coverage and feedback. If I don't speak to you, I wish you and your families happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nConferences now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we delivered solid results and completed a major milestone, closing our acquisition of Juniper Networks. Together with Juniper, we will accelerate our momentum across our 3 strategic business pillars: networking, cloud and AI, building a stronger, leaner and more profitable HPE. In Q3, HPE achieved record-breaking revenue with and without Juniper. Revenue was $9.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year, fueled by strong momentum across AI, networking and hybrid cloud. .\nWe grew revenues year-over-year across our 3 largest business segments. Demand was broad-based across our products and services. We increased sequential operating profit dollars in server hybrid cloud and both Intelligent Edge and the new combined networking segment. We also grew operating profit dollars in Financial Services on a year-over-year basis. The new combined networking segment accounted for nearly 50% of HPE's non-GAAP consolidated operating profit. We also improved sequential operating profit margins in server and hybrid cloud. Our improved profitability flowed through to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44.\nFree cash flow was $719 million as we significantly lowered our inventory driven by higher AI backlog conversion to revenue and strong supply chain execution. We continue to transform our business through catalyst, the structural cost-saving program we announced last quarter, including enhancing operational efficiency simplifying our portfolio, adopting AI and optimizing our workforce. In Q3, customers continue to demonstrate strong demand for our AI portfolio. We nearly doubled our AI order sequentially, driven by sovereign opportunities up approximately 250%.\nCumulative orders since Q1 2023 for sovereign and enterprise now account for more than 50% of total AI systems net orders. We accessed the quarter with record AI backlog at $3.7 billion. Marie will provide more details on the quarter and our Q4 fiscal year 2025 guide. But first, I would like to provide key Q3 highlights across our business segments.\nI am incredibly pleased that we closed the Juniper acquisition in July. Integration is progressing well. I have been spending time with Rami and the new combined networking leadership team, which is world-class. Going forward, we will refer to the combination of our HPE Intelligent Ag segment and Juniper as our new HPE Networking segment. Our vision for this segment is clear, to build the best networking business, providing customers with a modern, secure and AI-driven networking portfolio.\n[indiscernible] and I will discuss our networking strategy in more detail at our upcoming Securities Analyst Meeting in October. On the demand front, the networking market recovery continues. In enterprise, we continue to see robust demand in campus and branch driven by the wire and wireless refresh, sassy and data center switching. WiFi 7 demand is ramping with orders up triple digits sequentially. In cloud, we see strong demand for networking for AI, particularly in data center switching and Juniper PTX routed. Revenue of $1.7 billion increased 54% year-over-year, driven by strong performances in both Intelligent Edge and Juniper.\nIntelligent Edge revenue increased 11% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. We generated double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in campus and branch data center switching automated [indiscernible] and services. We also grew SaaS and security revenue. These strong results contributed to sustained momentum in networking SaaS and support services. Operating profit for the networking segment was $360 million, up 43% year-over-year, benefiting from one month of June results and operating profit dollars expansion in Intelligent Edge. Network and innovation is accelerating across the entire networking portfolio. Just last week, we introduced a new Mist AgenticAI-native innovations for campus and branch data center switching and automated one.\nThese complement the new agent AI mesh technology from our HPE Aruba networking portfolio that we announced alongside Green Lake Intelligence at HP Discover in June. Our innovation has been noticed by the market. HPE and Juniper Networks were both recognized again as leaders in the latest 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise wire and wireless LAN infrastructure. Customers are already taking advantage of the power of our full HP portfolio with inclusion of HPE Juniper networking solutions.\nFor example, Early this year, HPE won a multimillion dollar deal with Spar Austria Group, a leading retailer in Central Europe. Spar is building out a digital business services platform underpinned by Green Lake. The full IT stack solution is designed and implemented by HPE Professional Services. It will be fully managed by HP Managed Services and includes Aruba switches, Juniper firewalls, Electra MP storage plus HPE Cloud Ops software, including Zerto, Opamp and Morpheus.\nThe solution will enable a cloud-native and AI-driven platform experience. Finally, with respect to integration synergies, we are reiterating at least $600 million in cost synergies over the next 3 years. In the server segment, market demand is robust across our portfolio. Revenue of $4.9 billion was an all-time high, increased 16% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter driven by strong conversion of AI orders and solid demand for traditional servers. AI systems revenue of $1.6 million was also an all-time high as we completed the delivery of a large GB 200 system.\nServer operating margin improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting early in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal. As we enter Q4, we continue to expect total server operating margin to be around 10% for the quarter. AI systems orders increased nearly 100% quarter-over-quarter, including Middle East sovereign winds and continued traction in enterprise. We have grown enterprise AI orders year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of fiscal 2024.\nFrom an innovation perspective, we continue to keep pace with new accelerators technology and time-to-market customer demands. Last month, we launched HPE servers with the new NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000 black well and NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra accelerated computing platforms. In traditional servers, customers are continuing to refresh aged infrastructure with more powerful, richly configured servers. As a result, revenue increased double digits year-over-year on mix shift to HPE Gen11 and Gen12 servers. During the quarter, we expanded the Gen 12 compute portfolio to include the latest AMD fifth generation EPYC processors. The new servers includes support for HP computer ops management with AI-driven life cycle management.\nWe expect the Gen12 adoption to accelerate through 2026. In Q3, we also released our next-generation HP nonstop compute solutions for mission-critical workloads with double the memory capacity and double the system interconnect bandwidth.\nFinally, hybrid cloud performance was solid. Revenue of $1.5 billion increased year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, operating profit margins were up 17 basis points and operating profit dollars increased 26% year-over-year.\nARR increased 75% compared to Q3 2024 with the inclusion of 1 month of Juniper results. On an organic basis, AIR increased 40%, in line with our guidance of 35% to 45% CAGR. In storage, we saw robust growth in our IP product portfolio. HPE electron storage revenue increased triple digits year-over-year. We have now shipped more than 5,000 ElectraNet to date. We continue to successfully migrate our customer installed base while gaining new customer logos resulting in a one point share gain in the most recently released IDC market share report.\nIn private cloud, we continue to ramp sales of our enterprise AI factory solutions. During Q3, we added twice the number of new private cloud AI customers compared to Q2 with particular interest in our developer configuration. Software is a core differentiator for our GreenLake Cloud and for our private cloud portfolio, which is a key contributor to our AIR growth.\nIn June, we announced our new HPE hybrid cloud up suite software, bringing together Morpheus, VMEsentials, Opsump and Zerto, to assist customers from hybrid cloud orchestration, virtualization and observability to continuous data protection. Our cloud software revenue in the quarter increased strong double digits year-over-year. At Discover Las Vegas, we unveiled GreenLake Intelligence. Our framework for deploying AI agents across cloud and infrastructure to simplify customers' hybrid IT operations.\nWe also expanded our Agentic AI capabilities in OPRA, networking and storage. Innovations like these continue to attract new customers to our GreenLake cloud. In Q3, we added approximately 2,000 new customers bringing our GreenLake cloud customer count to approximately 44,000.\nIn closing, as we look ahead, I am excited for HPE's next chapter. The completion of our Juniper acquisition position us to win in networking as the market enters a new era of IT and business transformation where AI, cloud and networking converge. We launched a new brand for HP to reflect this potential. The brand is modern, expresses what our technology and talent make possible and reinforces our relevance with our customers. Our vision for the company is clear, to lead in the AI era through a modern secure Clanative AI-driven networking portfolio that accelerates our profitable growth. We are focused on executing with precision to capitalize on the growing opportunities in the market to deliver strong value to our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to providing more details about our strategy and our long-term value creation framework at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15 at the New York Stock Exchange.\nI would like now to turn it over to Marie to provide more insights into our quarterly results and full fiscal year guide. Marie?\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter while navigating an evolving market environment. Regarding our results. First, all segments of our business performed well. Our server business has moved past the pricing and discounting issues we reported earlier this year in compute. Hybrid cloud posted its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year top line growth and operating margin expansion. And revenue growth that our Intelligent Edge business is improving as the networking market recovery continues.\nSecond, I'm pleased that we completed our acquisition of Juniper, which will shift our revenue mix towards a higher growth, higher-margin networking business. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to our non-GAAP results in year 1 enhancing our profitability as we capture synergies and drive new market opportunities without increased scale. And finally, we made solid progress on our cost-reduction initiatives announced last quarter. I'm looking forward to sharing more about the next chapter of our company at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\nLet's talk about the details of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, which included Juniper was up 18% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and up 11% excluding Juniper revenue of $480 million. Excluding Juniper, total revenue of $8.7 billion exceeded the high end of our outlook range. Demand was strong this quarter, and we did not see material demand pull-in. Our reported annualized recurring revenue run rate was $3.1 billion, including $519 million contributed by Juniper.\nReported ARR was up 75% year-over-year or up 40%, excluding Juniper. Software and Services ARR, including Juniper, doubled year-over-year as the mix of this higher margin revenue improved sequentially by 640 basis points to over 81%. Including Juniper, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.9%, down 190 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable mix within server, networking and hybrid cloud, which more than offset the beneficial margin contribution from 1 month of Juniper.\nExcluding Juniper, gross margin was 28.3%. Non-GAAP operating expense, including Juniper as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and and declined 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strong revenue performance and disciplined cost management, partially offset by variable compensation. We will continue to manage costs rigorously as we target efficiencies through catalyst, complemented by at least $600 million at expected Juniper related cost synergies over the next 3 years with $200 million expected to be realized next year.\nExcluding Juniper, non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.2%, down 160 basis points year-over-year and down 120 basis points sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline as we grew revenue faster than expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin, including Juniper, was 8.5%, down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower gross margins, partially offset by cost management. The 50 basis point sequential improvement was primarily due to the inclusion of Juniper's results.\nExcluding Juniper, operating margin was 8.1%, down 190 basis points year-over-year, but up 10 basis points sequentially. During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of inventory management. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 was toward the high end of our guided range of $0.40 to $0.45. And non-GAAP diluted net EPS includes a $0.01 net impact attributable to consolidating 1 month of Juniper's results and the impact of net interest costs related to the acquisition.\nQ3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.21, below our guidance of $0.24 to $0.29. In terms of these results, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $326 million in net costs primarily due to Juniper related acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition, disposition and other charges, partially offset by adjustments for taxes, gain from litigation settlement and other adjustments.\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Starting with networking. As previously mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Juniper on July 2. So our Q3 earnings report includes only one month of Juniper's results. Our Q4 networking results will include our first full quarter of consolidated Juniper financials. We will provide more details regarding our near-term and longer-term strategy and outlook for our networking business at our Security Analyst Meeting next month.\nNet working revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 54% year-over-year, up 48% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year, excluding Juniper. Strong networking revenue growth was driven by the ongoing recovery in the networking market and consolidation of Juniper's results for the month of July. While it's early days, we are pleased with our order growth and revenue performance we generated across the combined networking business. Reported orders grew strong double digits year-over-year, including double-digit growth in both campus switching and the SMB markets.\nExcluding Juniper, Intelligent Edge orders grew a mid-teens percent year-over-year. Demand in Q3 was strong as sell-out increased sequentially and year-over-year. Net working operating margin was 20.8%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. This is inclusive of a 22.7% operating margin from HPE's former Intelligent Edge business and 15.8% operating margin from Juniper's networking business. Excluding Juniper, operating margin was down 90 basis points sequentially, primarily due to variable compensation and product-related costs.\nServer revenue was $4.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially, above the high end of our guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter revenue increase was driven largely by a double-digit increase in AI systems revenue due to a large AI deal we shipped in the quarter, augmented by higher AUP from a favorable mix shift in core compute.\nIn traditional server, revenue increased sequentially, driven by volume increases and AUP strength supported by the continued shift to Gen 11 service augmented by early yet improving sales of our Gen 12 service. In AI systems, we signed $2.1 billion in net new orders driven by robust growth in sovereign net new orders, which increased by triple digits both year-over-year and sequentially, while enterprise net new orders were also up year-over-year.\nTogether, enterprise and sovereign constitute greater than 50% of our cumulative AI orders since Q1 '23. We generated $1.6 billion of revenue during the quarter, up 25% year-over-year and up 57% sequentially driven by the previously disclosed large AI system that we shipped in the quarter. We finished Q3 with our pipeline at multiples of our $3.7 billion ending backlog. Serve operating margin of 6.4% was consistent with our outlook. Margin performance improved sequentially, benefiting from the changes we made in pricing and discounting earlier in the year, which returned traditional server product margins to historical levels. This was partially offset by higher AI mix, including a large deal and AI inventory.\nMoving to hybrid cloud. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, revenue increased 1%, consistent with our outlook. In storage, our HPE Electro MP platform continues to drive robust growth. achieving triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, while high double-digit margins expanded sequentially again.\nIn Q3, new logos were up more than 350 sequentially and grew over 70% year-over-year. In private cloud, revenue grew strong double digits year-over-year as we see continued growth in our pipeline for PC AI with a number of new enterprise customers doubled quarter-over-quarter. Also, our VM essential solutions closed over 120 customers in Q3 and has generated a pipeline exceeding 1,000 interested customers since its launch last November.\nHybrid cloud operating margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 5.9% and increased 70 basis points year-over-year the fourth consecutive quarter that our OP margin has expanded on a year-over-year basis.\nLastly, our Financial Services business generated revenue of $886 million, down 1% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes increased 2% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Our Q3 loss ratio was 0.7%, and return on equity improved sequentially and year-over-year to 17.7%. Operating margin of 9.9% increased 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a higher mix of financing versus operating leases, but declined 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by unfavorable operating expenses despite the higher revenue.\nLast quarter, we announced Catalyst a series of initiatives designed to accelerate growth increase efficiency and make it easier to do business with HPE.\nOur starting point was an approximate 5% workforce reduction from the exit of Q1 with gross savings of at least $350 million by fiscal year 2027. We are executing well against our plan and expect to achieve our target of 20% of the total savings by fiscal year-end 2025. We are taking an AI-first approach to reimagine our key workflows and have started in my own finance organization, leveraging AI to increase productivity.\nTurning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter and free cash flow was a positive $790 million, a significant improvement sequentially and as expected. At the end of fiscal Q3, inventory totaled $7.2 billion, down $933 million sequentially. Excluding July ending Juniper inventory of approximately $1 billion. Q3 ending stand-alone HP inventory was $6.2 billion, down $1.9 billion sequentially. Reducing inventory levels has been a key priority, and we exited Q3 with our balance near our normalized level.\nOur Q3 cash conversion cycle was positive 35 days, up 9 days from last quarter. The inclusion of Juniper unfavorably impacted our CCC calculation this quarter as it includes only one month of Juniper's revenue and cost of sales results versus the consolidation of Juniper's July ending balances. This timing issue obskews both the progress we made improving our CCC and the positive contributions for working capital the business generated on a sequential basis when excluding Juniper. We expect our CCC will improve in Q4 with a full quarter's consolidation of Juniper's financials as we expect the amount of free cash flow we generate to increase sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality.\nWe returned $171 million to shareholders through dividends, but were unable to repurchase shares during the quarter because we were in possession of material nonpublic information that we have since disclosed. As we prioritize debt reduction, we remain committed to our dividend policy and expect quarterly share repurchases comparable to levels reported in the first half of fiscal '25. And partially offsetting share dilution resulting from stock-based compensation.\nAt quarter end and including incremental debt associated with the transaction, our pro forma combined net leverage ratio was 3.1x. We remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating and intend to reduce our net leverage ratio back to our target in the 2x range by the end of fiscal 2027. Now let's turn to guidance. We are revising our FY '25 outlook to incorporate 4 months of contributions from Juniper Networks.\nFor revenue, we expect constant currency growth of 14% to 16% and estimate currency impacts of 30 basis points, up nominally versus last quarter's estimate. With the inclusion of Juniper, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin outlook for Q4 to be in the mid-30% range and fiscal 2025 to be above 30%. We expect operating expense to increase sequentially, driven by a full quarter inclusion of Juniper. We expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be in the upper 9% range at the midpoint, benefiting from a sequential improvement in Q4 to the upper 11% range, driven by the continued improvement in server margins and the accretive contributions from Juniper.\nWe are revising our FY '25 GAAP EPS range to $0.42 to $0.46, which includes the impact of Juniper. We are raising our non-GAAP EPS range to $1.88 to $1.92, which reflects accretive contributions from Juniper, though minimal for the year. We are reaffirming our estimate of a $0.02 impact from tariffs in the second half of the year.\nLastly, we are revising our free cash flow outlook to approximately $700 million. Excluding Juniper, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. Through the end of Q3, year-to-date free cash flow was $934 million use of cash. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up materially quarter-over-quarter due to better net earnings in addition to favorable working capital driven by significant improvements in accounts receivable collections.\nFor Q4, we expect revenue to be between $9.7 billion and $10.1 billion. For networking, we expect revenue will be up over 60% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a full quarter of Juniper. We expect our networking operating margin in Q4 and fiscal 2025 to be in the low 20% range. For hybrid cloud, we expect revenue to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter with a sequentially improved operating margin in the mid- to high single digits. For server, we forecast a mid- to high single-digit decline in revenue quarter-over-quarter, driven by a greater than 30% sequential decline in AI systems revenue following the large deal that shipped in Q3.\nWe expect server operating margin to improve sequentially to around 10% for the quarter, reflecting continued momentum behind our improved execution and an improved mix towards enterprise and sovereign as we continue to focus on profitable growth. Going forward, we will remain focused on profitable growth in the Service segment, and we'll continue to assess the optimal balance between volume growth and margins. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.54 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.56 and $0.60.\nOur Q4 EPS outlook reflects a sequential increase in diluted shares outstanding to 1.44 billion attributable to the conversion of Juniper related stock-based compensation shares and forward awards.\nFollowing the acquisition of Juniper, we now expect Q4 OI&E in the $180 million to $200 million range. We expect Q4 free cash flow to be up sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality and favorable working capital and increased net earnings.\nWith that, I look forward to seeing you at SAM in October. And now let me open the floor for questions.",

Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, HPE delivered solid results. We executed well and delivered both revenue and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share above the high end of guidance. Through focused and disciplined execution, we have addressed the operational challenges we experienced in our Service segment last quarter. We expect these actions will contribute to margin improvement through fiscal year-end.\nIn the second quarter, we saw a very dynamic macro and trade policy environment. The IT industry continues to navigate significant uncertainty brought on by tariffs, the AI diffusion policy withdrawal and broad macroeconomic concerns. While this led to uneven demand during the quarter, we did not benefit from significant order pull-ins. We ended Q2 with our stronger pipeline compared to Q1, reinforcing that our strategy is the right one. Q2 revenue was $7.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year and just above the high end of our previously provided guidance. We saw year-over-year revenue growth in every product segment. The results were led by higher AI system revenue conversion in Server, solid performance in Intelligent Edge and stronger-than-expected performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment which was driven by our HPE Electra MP storage transition and the continued adoption of HPE GreenLake Cloud subscription services.\nQ2 operating profit grew year-over-year in Hybrid Cloud Intelligent Edge and HPE Financial Services. As we said in our Q1 earnings, we expect that server operating profit to decline quarter-over-quarter -- although our Server revenue and operating margin were near the high end of our Q2 guide. We remain laser focused on execution in our server segment.\nSince our last update, we have closely monitored the changes implemented to improve profitability. This includes the rollout of new pricing analytics, increased discount scrutiny and inventory management. As we said in our last call, it will take a couple of quarters to realize the full benefit of these measures, and we expect our Server segment operating margin will recover to approximately 10% exiting Q4. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38, above the high end of our previously provided guidance. We benefited from lower-than-anticipated tariff impact and more favorable OI&E. Net of these items, non-GAAP EPS was still at the high end of our outlook, driven by solid revenue performance and cost management.\nAs we move into the second half, we have improved line of sight to timing of our AI revenue conversion. As such, we are tightening our revenue outlook to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. In addition, we are raising the low end of our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share range by $0.08. We continue to capitalize on the mega trends reshaping the IT industry across networking, AI and hybrid cloud.\nIn networking, the market continues to recover. Year-over-year, our business achieved its third consecutive quarter of orders growth and return to revenue growth. In AI, we signed $1.1 billion of net new orders with enterprise accounted for 1/3. We converted more than $1 billion into revenue, up from $900 million last quarter, and we exited with $3.2 billion of backlog in AI systems. Our pipeline remains multiples of our backlog.\nIn our Hybrid Cloud segment, we saw another solid quarter of storage revenue performance with our Alletra portfolio growing high double digits year-over-year. The transition to a subscription business model is a revenue headwind in the near term or more accretive to profitability long term. Orders for Alletra MP have grown more than 75% year-over-year for 4 consecutive quarters, contributed to our growing deferred software revenue balance. This demonstrates the value of our disaggregated architecture with multi-protocol support and the flexibility of our offering.\nFinally, GreenLake continues to deliver strong results. We are growing customer count, which now totals approximately 42,000 generating over $2.2 billion of annualized revenue run rate. This is up 47% year-over-year and above our 35% to 45% CAGR commitment. Software and Services continue to be more than 70% of our demonstrating our portfolio shift to higher growth and higher margin areas of the stack.\nMarie will provide more details on Q2 and our fiscal year outlook. But first, I would like to highlight several recent product launches that further reinforce our strategy. Last month, we launched the industry's most advanced private cloud portfolio. Morphis and our HPE virtualization software have been integrated into our HPE Private Cloud portfolio. Through this integration, we can lower customers' virtualization cost by up to 90% on a core basis, and unified management of their entire multi-cloud and multi-vendor IT estate. Customer interest in VM Essentials has been very strong. Notably, downfall is planning to replace 75% of its virtual estate with VM Essentials within HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise.\nIn Networking, we introduced new capabilities with HPE Aruba Network in Central to expand universal Zero Trust network access solutions to help enterprises bolster cybersecurity. HPE Aruba Network in Central is now also available to deploy as an on-premises option. This is particularly helpful for customers prioritizing data sovereignty. Aruba Network in Central now manages over 5 million devices and has contributed to strong AIR subscription growth within Intelligent Edge.\nWe are maintaining a rapid pace of AI innovation in our deep and long-standing partnership with NVIDIA. One of the cluster build-outs we are working on right now with NVIDIA is a large deployment of NVIDIA GRACE Blackwell MVL72 systems. We are nearing completion and appreciate the continued partnership that pairs our capabilities. Most recently, at GTC Type A at Computex, we announced several enhanced storage and server platforms targeting all customer segments. In 2025, we integrated NVIDIA's latest GPUs into our server portfolio, which delivered record-breaking performance for generative AI influencing.\nWe announced advancements in storage to unify enterprise data management to create context-rich ready object data with built-in intelligence. And we launched the HPE Alletra storage MPX 10000 SDK solution for the NVDI data platform, bringing enterprise data into an intelligent orchestrated pipeline within the NVIDIA AI ecosystem. All these new innovations are aligned to our strategy to continue to move up stack to areas of higher growth with higher margins.\nWe continue to help enterprises accelerate their business transformation across Networking, Hybrid Cloud and AI, and we will unveil even more exciting breakthrough innovations at the HPE discover later this month.\nFinally, I want to reinforce our commitment to closing the Juniper Network's transaction. We expect the proposed transaction will deliver at least $450 million in annual run rate synergies to our shareholders within 36 months of closing the transaction. The deal will have both companies deliver a modern, secure AI-driven edge-to-cloud portfolio of networking products and services. We continue to expect to close the transaction before the end of fiscal year 2025.\nIn closing, in Q2, we delivered solid results through focused and disciplined execution. As we committed, we have addressed the server execution challenges. Our leadership team and I took accountability and swift action despite the challenges of a fluid macro environment. We remain focused on executing against our goals and becoming a more agile and nimble company to continue to increase our profitability and enhance shareholder value.\nI remain excited about the profitable growth opportunities HPE has ahead, including the anticipated closure of the Juniper Networks transaction. We have the right strategy and the right team to continue to accelerate value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Marie. Marie?\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. In Q2, we addressed the execution challenges we experienced in Q1, which enabled us to drive improved margin performance in our server business as we moved through the quarter. While we still have more work to do to return the segment's operating profit margin performance to a double-digit rate, we are on the right trajectory to achieve that by Q4 of this year.\nIn addition, our Intelligent Edge business returned to year-over-year top line growth after 5 quarters as the networking market recovery gained momentum. And we reported double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in our hybrid cloud segment for the third consecutive quarter with all product lines contributing to growth. We also made significant progress against the cost reduction program we announced last quarter, which we expect will contribute to our results in future quarters.\nWe reported non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38 ahead of our outlook, driven in part by a more moderate tariff impact and operational benefits. However, we continue to navigate a complex macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape and remain prepared to take additional action in the back half of the year to deliver against our fiscal '25 outlook.\nLet's talk about the details of the quarter. Our second quarter revenue was $7.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year but down 3% quarter-over-quarter reflecting strong top line performance in Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud and a year-over-year increase in server revenue. we did not see a significant benefit from tariff-related demand pull forward based on quarterly business clarity and historical order patterns. Our annualized revenue run rate was $2.2 billion, up 47% year-over-year, driven again by AI and Intelligent Edge.\nOur Software and Services ARR grew nearly 60% year-over-year and improved its mix of ARR by 700 basis points to 75% and primarily due to an increase in GreenLake Flex subscriptions and AI services. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.4%, down 370 basis points year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted primarily by an unfavorable mix within server, including the dilutive backlog in traditional compute we carried into the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, and down 150 basis points year-over-year, reflecting lower gross margins, partially offset by cost management.\nThe 190 basis point sequential decline was primarily due to increased variable compensation and higher marketing expenses. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased sequentially from a record low in Q1 and declined 220 basis points year-over-year, reflecting better cost discipline as our business scales further. We'll continue managing discretionary costs and driving efficiencies while working to increase the incremental structural cost savings we drove this quarter.\nFree cash flow was negative $847 million slightly better than expected, due in part to the conversion of some AI backlog. GAAP diluted net loss per share of $0.82 was below guidance of positive $0.08 to $0.14 primarily due to a noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38 was above our guided range of $0.28 to $0.34. EPS included $0.02 each related to tariffs and OI&E expense.\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $1.7 billion and net cost primarily driven by a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion or $1.03 per share related to our Hybrid Cloud business. This charge is due primarily to the macroeconomic uncertainty that played out during the second quarter, requiring an additional interim impairment test of that goodwill. These tests use a market-based cost of capital assumption, which increased significantly since our last test leading to the material noncash impairment charge.\nOur view on our Hybrid Cloud business has not changed. Other factors excluded from our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share include expenses related to our cost reduction program, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition, disposition and other charges amortization of intangible assets and H3C divestiture related severance costs.\nNow let's turn to our segment results. Server revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year and a decline of 5% sequentially, consistent with the higher end of the guidance range we provided. The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline was impacted by lower traditional compute volumes due to the implementation of corrective pricing actions we took at the end of Q1, offset partially by higher-than-expected AI systems revenue. We took decisive actions to address the execution issues that impacted our performance last quarter.\nFirstly, we implemented more rigorous reporting processes and analytics to more quickly identify and remediate operational issues. Secondly, we tightened our deal desk controls to require greater management scrutiny, including forward costing assumptions on orders. Lastly, we are managing inventory exposure associated with AI transactions and potential component transitions. We believe these steps will improve performance and profitability as we progress through the back half of fiscal '25 and into next year.\nIn traditional Server, consistent with our expectations, revenue declined sequentially, driven by volume declines offsetting AUP growth as the Gen11 server refresh continues to drive the majority of our core compute sales mix. We began shipping Gen12 servers during Q2 and remain confident in its adoption and growth trajectory.\nIn AI Systems, we signed $1.1 billion in net new orders driven by strong growth in our enterprise and sovereign markets on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. We recognized more than $1 billion of revenue during the quarter, up from $900 million last year. AI systems revenue increased by greater than 10% sequentially versus our guidance of a modest decline due to improved customer readiness. Server operating margin of 5.9% was consistent with expectations. Our margin performance improved over the course of the quarter as the remediation actions we implemented in late Q1 helped offset some of the backlog pricing headwinds we carried into the quarter.\nTariff-related headwinds were milder than expected and margins are expected to benefit further from remediation actions as we progress through the second half of the year. Our Intelligent Edge business performance aligned with expectations as revenue and operating profit returned to year-over-year growth in Q2 for the first time in 5 quarters. Revenue was $1.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year, in line with our outlook for positive revenue growth due to the ongoing network market recovery and the diminished effect of the prior year's backlog.\nRevenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting improved demand. We saw orders grow high single digits year-over-year, including double-digit growth in both data center and campus switching. WiFi 7 demand ramped meaningfully with orders up triple digits sequentially. Federal state and local and education spending was mixed in the quarter as the U.S. government adjusted the new administration's priorities, while enterprise spending continued its positive trend.\nOur orders remain strong and our channel inventory levels remained healthy as sell-through increased sequentially despite some pockets of softness across our geographies. Operating margin was 23.6%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and cost discipline, resulting in operating profit dollar growth of 16%. Operating margin was down 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to increased variable compensation expense and slightly lower gross profit.\nMoving to Hybrid Cloud. Revenue was $1.5 billion. Once again, we saw broad-based strength across all areas of the business contributing to strong revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue increased 4%, exceeding our expectations. In storage, our HPE Alletra MP platform continues to drive robust growth with revenue up triple digits year-over-year, and new logos up almost 300 sequentially. In addition, it continues to constitute over half of our IP block orders.\nIn Private Cloud, we are seeing a strong pipeline for our PC AI product, doubling quarter-over-quarter while VM Essentials has garnered at least 1,000 interested customers. Hybrid cloud operating margin rose 440 basis points year-over-year to 5.4% and driven by strong cost management, but declined 160 basis points sequentially due to higher variable compensation.\nLastly, Financial Services. Our Financial Services business generated revenue of $856 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter -- financing volumes decreased 20% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Our Q2 loss ratio was 0.6% and return on equity totaled 17.5%. Operating margin of 10.4% increased 110 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter and was the highest in 2 years, primarily due to strong cost management.\nMoving to cash flow and capital allocation. We consumed $461 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and free cash flow was an outflow of $847 million slightly better than we guided, which benefited from better-than-expected non-GAAP net earnings and inventory reduction. Inventory totaled $8.1 billion at the end of the period, down $481 million sequentially. Reducing our inventory balance to more normalized levels remains a key priority, and we expect to reduce inventory levels further in Q3 as we deploy a large AI system order booked earlier this year.\nQ2 cash conversion cycle was positive 26 days, up 21 days from last quarter. This was driven by a decrease in days payable due to higher vendor payments and lower inventory purchases and an increase in days receivable due to later shipment timing in the quarter, offset by a decrease in days of inventory due to higher shipments. We expect sequential improvements in free cash flow partially driven by an improved cash conversion cycle over the back half of the year. We returned $171 million through dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively.\nOur results this quarter reflect the importance of balancing investments in innovation and growth with disciplined cost management to improve our long-term profitability and to drive shareholder value. Last quarter, we announced a cost-reduction program aimed at streamlining our workforce and reducing our cost structure. This was an important first step, but only part of broader actions were undertaking. This program is largely centered around a 5% workforce reduction that we expect to complete largely by year-end.\nWe are on track to achieve our savings goals expected for FY '25. We ended the quarter with a headcount just under 59,000, the lowest we have seen as an independent company. We are reducing management layers and flattening our organization because flatter is faster enabling swifter decision-making and improving agility across functions. Today, we are accelerating those cost efforts through Catalyst, a comprehensive series of initiatives designed to accelerate revenue growth while also driving structural cost savings. These initiatives fall into 4 key categories and include the prior workforce cost reduction program, which we announced last quarter, in addition to efforts around operational efficiency, optimizing our portfolio and using AI across our business. These workforce optimization efforts are covered by the existing $350 million in charges we announced last quarter and any resulting benefits are included in our FY '25 guide. We will update you at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October when we provide our fiscal 2016 outlook.\nAs part of Catalyst, we want to make it easier to do business with us, simplifying our offerings, streamlining our sales processes and aligning our team internally to be more responsive to customers' needs. In addition, we will be leveraging AI to improve efficiency across our business. As an example, we are adopting an agenetic AI initiative as part of our campaign. Within finance, HPE and Deloitte codeveloped Zora AI CFO Insights agents built on NVIDIA's advanced AI stack and deployed on our own HPE private cloud AI platform. This strategic move will transform our executive reporting, we're turning data into actionable intelligence, accelerating our reporting cycles by approximately 50% and reducing processing costs by an estimated 25%. Our ambition is clear, a leaner, faster and more competitive organization. Nothing is off limits. We are focused on rethinking the business, not just reducing our costs, but transforming the way we operate. We'll keep you regularly updated on our progress.\nBefore addressing our outlook given the evolving and uncertain state of global trade policy, I want to provide a brief update to our tariff outlook. Our initial full year guidance of a $0.07 impact to earnings reflected our best estimate based on tariffs in place on March 4, net of our mitigation efforts. And as mentioned, we absorbed $0.02 in the second quarter. Looking out to the second half of the year, we are reducing our tariff impact by $0.01 to $0.02 as the 90-day pause currently in effect for most tariffs expires on July 9.\nFor fiscal 2025, we are tightening our guidance due to improved visibility into the second half of the year. We now expect constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 9%. We estimate currency impacts of about 20 basis points, improved from our prior view as FX becomes less of a headwind due to a weaker outlook for the U.S. dollar. By segment, we expect to continue Intelligent Edge to grow mid-single digits. Hybrid Cloud to grow high single digits and that Server will grow low double digits.\nWe are maintaining our outlook for non-GAAP gross margin to be below 30% for the full year, with Q4 exiting the year above that. In Q3, we expect operating expense to increase sequentially due to the higher marketing expenses associated with our annual discovery event but is expected to step back down in Q4 to a level more consistent with Q2.\nWe expect full year non-GAAP operating margin above 9% at the midpoint as we see sequential improvements in the second half of fiscal 2025, exiting the year approaching normal ranges. By segment, we continue to expect hybrid cloud operating margin in the mid to high single digits. Intelligent Edge to remain in the mid-20% range. And further, to improve sequentially, exiting the year with an operating margin around 10%.\nWe now expect OI&E will constitute a net benefit of approximately $15 million. We are narrowing our fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to $1.78 to $1.90. $0.03 of this is related to a lower-than-expected net tariff expense and $0.01 is related to operational improvements. We are guiding GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $0.30 and $0.42 inclusive of the goodwill impairment charge previously mentioned versus our previous GAAP guidance range of approximately $1.15 to $1.35. Our outlook for free cash flow of approximately $1 billion remains intact.\nFor Q3, we expect revenue will be between $8.2 billion and $8.5 billion. For Intelligent Edge, we expect revenue will continue to improve sequentially as the networking market recovery progresses, with operating margin remaining in the mid-20% range. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect revenue to increase slightly sequentially with operating margin in the mid-single digits, improved sequentially and year-over-year. For Server, we forecast a sequential increase at mid-teens rate, reflecting a strong double-digit increase in AI systems revenue due to a large AI deal we expect to ship in Q3. Server operating margin is expected to improve sequentially in falling in the mid- to high single digits range due to the corrective actions we took offsetting a higher mix of AI systems revenue.\nWe expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.24 and $0.29 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $0.40 and $0.45. We expect the second half of fiscal 2025 will be seasonally stronger than the first half with free cash flow rebounding sequentially in Q3, primarily due to the continued reduction in inventories and increased net income.\nWith that, I'll open the floor for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Glaser\n\nMD, SVP and Head of Pathfinder\n\nGood afternoon. I am Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I would like to welcome you to our Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HPE's Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our HPE Investor Relations web page.\nElements of the financial information referenced on this call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024.\nFor more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC for a discussion of these risks. For financial information we have expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details.\nThroughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared comments. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I share my comments on our quarterly and yearly performance, I would like to provide an update on the Juniper Networks acquisition. We have received approvals from key geographies around the world, including the European Union, U.K., India, South Korea, and Australia, which have given unconditional clearance and see the competitive benefits of the transaction. In the United States, we are engaged with the Department of Justice, and we expect their review will continue into the new calendar year.\nWe anticipate the deal will close in the early part of 2025, within the previously stated time frame. Both HPE and Juniper continue to believe the transaction will enable us to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for both hybrid cloud and AI. The combined companies' enhanced ability to compete and innovate will fundamentally improve the networking industry. This transaction will also strengthen U.S. national security interest by advancing HPE's position as a strong U.S. innovator among global technology companies.\nTurning to results. We had an exceptional fourth quarter to cap off a strong year. In actual dollar terms, we generated record quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year, exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history. Our results reflect the continued adoption of HPE GreenLake and the acceleration of our revenue growth in AI. Q4 and fiscal year '24 results exceeded our expectations for revenue, diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow.\nWe drove sequential revenue growth across each of our segments, a continuation of the positive momentum we saw build throughout the year across our business. Q4 constituted our third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year growth rates in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Contributing significantly to our performance was record server revenue of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year, a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nSequentially, AI systems revenue was up 16% to $1.5 billion, exiting fiscal year '24 with $6.7 billion in cumulative orders since Q1 of fiscal year '23. After the close of Q4, I am pleased to share that our AI systems demand remains strong. We have received new orders, bringing AI systems backlog to over $3.5 billion. Our traditional server business also continued to reflect improving market dynamics as we drove our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit orders growth.\nHybrid Cloud revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, resulting in revenue of $1.6 billion, with increasing revenue for HPE Private Cloud and continued growth in HPE storage. We are seeing customers like Lupin Limited, a large India pharmaceutical company, repatriate workloads from the public cloud to enhance their data security and meet regulatory and compliance requirements.\nCustomer adoption of our HPE Alletra Storage MP solutions continues to rise at an accelerated pace. Since launch, we have sold approximately 3,000 systems. Miami Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the United States, implemented HPE Alletra Storage MP to consolidate an existing storage footprint to lower TCO and improve performance and sustainability.\nOur Intelligent Edge business achieved its third consecutive quarter of orders growth, reflecting our expectations for an improving demand environment. We are particularly pleased with the double-digit year-over-year order growth that we saw in data center networking, an important growth market for our HP Aruba Networking business. HPE Financial Services financing volumes of $2.1 billion rose to an all-time high this quarter, driven by strong demand for HPE GreenLake and AI financing.\nIt is clear customers need more investment capacity, whether to deploy AI or to accelerate the adoption of Hybrid Cloud. Our record-breaking revenue performance in Q4 resulted in record profitability with non-GAAP operating profit of $938 million. That translated to non-GAAP operating margin of more than 11%, a 110 basis points increase sequentially.\nAs a result of our exceptional Q4 performance, fiscal year '24 revenue growth topped 3% year-over-year, exceeding $30 billion as we added more than 9,000 new customers across the portfolio. Combined with our disciplined operating expense management, which accelerated in the back half of the year, we generated a record-breaking $2.3 billion in free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of at least $1.9 billion for the year. We close the year on a strong note, exceeding our full year commitments for revenue, diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow.\nWe are very pleased with our results and excited about the opportunities ahead for HPE. It is clear our strategy is working. We have a tremendous set of assets, including extensive solutions from edge-to-cloud, enabling us to meet our customer needs across AI, networking, and hybrid cloud. Providing a full stack of product and services clearly differentiates us versus our competition and accelerate value for our shareholders.\nIn Q4, we continued our investment in innovation, which further enhanced our product portfolio and position us to capture additional market share. AI is clearly transformative for our customers and HPE is positioned to lead in the next wave of innovation. At our recent AI Day, we announced the industry-first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture, a critical capability for customers to leverage the next generation of direct liquid cooled GPUs and CPUs while facilitating peak performance as they manage increased energy densities this industry-first architecture is unique to HPE and results from decades of experience in liquid cooling technologies.\nTwo weeks ago, at SC24, we announced our newest 400-gigabits HPE Slingshot direct liquid cooled networking fabric of products engineered to support both generative AI cluster workloads and exascale supercomputing. These innovations are enhancing the performance of our AI systems and supercomputing product lines, differentiating us from the competition.\nAt SC24, we also announced that HPE has delivered the fastest verified supercomputer in the world to the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is not only the world's fastest supercomputer at more than 1.7 exaflop, it is also among the most energy-efficient in the world. HPE now has deployed 7 of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including numbers 1, 2, and 3 on the list.\nWe also continue to innovate to help accelerate enterprise adoption of AI. Since launching HPE Private Cloud AI, we have expanded our collaboration with Deloitte to help businesses of all sizes to deploy AI solutions tailored for their industry-specific use cases such as C-Suite AI and many others. In addition, we introduced the Unleash AI partner program to grow our ecosystem and expand customers' ability to address their AI use cases with HPE Private Cloud AI. While we are still in early days, interest is strong with hundreds of customers in the pipeline with many compelling proof-of-concept underway.\nWe closed our first deals during Q4, including RWE, a leading company in the field of renewable energy, which selected HPE Private Cloud AI to unlock insights from weather data. Customers are also asking us to help them simplify their VMware private clouds and optimize their virtualization costs.\nAt HPE Discover Barcelona 2 weeks ago, we launched HPE VM Essentials, which enables customers to manage their virtualization estates across HP, VMware, and many others. We have built on our recent acquisitions of Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, giving customers operational flexibility and allowing them to no longer be locked into a single virtualization vendor. With HPE VM Essentials, they can achieve up to 5x lower TCO.\nAs a part of our HPE VM Essentials, we also provide an enterprise-grade open source KVM virtualization solution. This allows customers to dramatically reduce costs while increasing their flexibility to innovate across a full suite of hybrid cloud operations capabilities in an on-premises multi-stack and a multi-cloud public environment.\nIn storage, we continue to invest in our multiprotocol HP Alletra Storage MP platform as we transition our storage portfolio to an AI-driven, cloud-native and disaggregated architecture. Our new HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000 is a revolution in new high-performance object storage designed for AI exabyte scale and optimized for high-speed unstructured data lakes with rapid restore for backup and recovery. Our AWS S3-compatible object storage interface and deduplication supports up to 20x data reduction and streamlines integration with any available backup solution in the market.\nWith HPE Alletra Storage MP X10000, customers can achieve up to 6x faster object storage performance compared to competitor solutions in the market. Finally, our Innovation Intelligent Edge are helping us to advance HP Aruba Networking Central with AIOps copilot capabilities built into our HPE GreenLake cloud. During the quarter, we announced 2 new solutions to enhance the networking operators experience and security for our customers.\nThe first is the integration with HPE OpsRamp to monitor third-party devices. We also introduced a behavioral analytical-based network detection and response capability, where we are leveraging network and telemetry to train AI models to monitor customer IoT devices. We have an important place in the market as a leading technology innovator. I am proud that HPE team members around the globe bring our innovations to customers every day to help them modernize their IT infrastructure and transform for the better.\nI am very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter results and the resulting outperformance in several of our full year commitments to our shareholders. Our strategy is well aligned to the mega trends reshaping networking, hybrid cloud, and AI, and our unique product portfolio is well positioned to capture new customers and accelerate value for our shareholders. We expect the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks to further enhance our portfolio, providing customers with complete edge-to-cloud solutions.\nI am extremely excited about the significant opportunity we have in the coming fiscal year to drive increased value for our shareholders. I am optimistic about what we can achieve and look forward to the year ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Marie who will provide more details about our Q4 results and guide for the first quarter. Marie?\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. We ended fiscal 2024 on solid footing and exceeded what we said we would do. We achieved record quarterly revenue, delivered solid profitability, and generated free cash flow above our guidance. We executed well in a dynamic environment, growing revenue sequentially in each segment as investments in AI are leading to infrastructure refreshes.\nIn Q4, we also maintained disciplined cost management and improved non-GAAP operating profit. A few highlights from our 2024 results. We grew AI systems revenue more than 150% to $4.1 billion and met our server non-GAAP operating margin target. We continued our product transition within storage and ended the year with Alletra MP accounting for a meaningful portion of total storage orders. Our transition to more software-defined storage will drive a greater mix of higher-margin recurring revenue over the long term.\nLastly, in Intelligent Edge, we rightsized our cost structure as we navigated a digestion period. We grew fiscal 2024 revenue 3% to $30.1 billion, exceeding the high end of the outlook range we provided in September. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.99 and free cash flow of $2.3 billion both came in above our revised outlook ranges. In total, we returned $826 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Overall, our results reflect focused execution and improving demand as customers implement AI strategies.\nLet me dive into the details of the quarter. We delivered record quarterly revenue and our second highest non-GAAP diluted net EPS, both of which came in above the high end of guidance. Total revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to a record $8.5 billion. Growth in the quarter was led by strong conversion of AI systems backlog, refreshes in traditional compute, better-than-expected performance within Hybrid Cloud, and a continued recovery in networking.\nWe are pleased to report non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58, above the high end of guidance despite dilution from the issuance of our convertible preferred securities in September, which was not factored into our outlook. ARR grew 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, nearly doubling since Q1 2023, primarily driven by HPE GreenLake. We added approximately 2,000 new HPE GreenLake customers during the quarter, ending the year with approximately 39,000 unique customers. I am happy to report continued demand for our differentiated AI system offerings, which resulted in strong double-digit sequential revenue growth to $1.5 billion. This record contribution from AI systems revenue, combined with lower mix of Intelligent Edge, drove gross margin down 390 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 30.9%.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year as reported and were down $5 million quarter-over-quarter as we focus on streamlining our cost structure and are closely managing discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Strong profitability rolled through to free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations and totaled $1.5 billion.\nFiscal 2024 free cash flow was $2.3 billion, our highest ever for the full year. GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.99 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 were both above guidance, benefiting from better-than-expected OI&E and expense management. GAAP EPS benefited primarily from a lower than previously expected tax expense on our aggregated H3C dispositions. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes the gain we recognized on the partial sale of our H3C investment at $162 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and other related charges and amortization of intangibles.\nNow let's turn to the segment results. Our server business was a key driver of record quarterly revenue and grew double digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. Server revenue achieved an all-time high of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter with sequential growth in AI systems and traditional servers. The traditional compute business continued its momentum during the quarter and grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by ongoing refreshes to our Gen11 server products, which carry higher AUPs. Adoption has been strongest in North America and Europe as customers are investing in new workloads.\nIn the fourth quarter, Gen11 accounted for more than 2/3 of our core compute revenue and contributed to AUP growth. In AI systems, we continue to grow the business to new highs. AI systems orders during the quarter were in line with our expectations at approximately $1.2 billion. However, we had an order book in Q4, leaving our net orders for the quarter at approximately $500 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have received orders that bring our current backlog to over $3.5 billion. As we have mentioned before, AI systems orders can be lumpy and this is an example of that. Fourth quarter server operating margin was 11.6%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\nMoving to Hybrid Cloud, we grew revenue 18% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, materially exceeding our guidance of a slight revenue increase. Revenue growth was led by Private Cloud and the continued ramp of Alletra MP. During the quarter, we received our first orders for Private Cloud AI as we target a growing pipeline that includes corporations across verticals and regions. Interest is strong in manufacturing, education, and financial services. We have also deployed Private Cloud AI internally and are moving use cases from the public cloud due to better cost performance and compliance.\nIn storage, we are balancing investments in owned IP products against market trends. Alletra MP remains ahead of our expectations and is the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history. Keep in mind, these sales carry a higher portion of deferred software and services revenue, which takes longer to translate to the P&L but benefits margins long term. Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 7.7%, up 390 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls.\nNow on to Intelligent Edge. We believe the business remains at a path of recovery and customers have largely digested excess inventories. Total Intelligent Edge revenue was $1.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, we saw growth in services, WLAN products and software, partially offset by declines in switching and campus. Importantly, we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline, giving us confidence that demand is improving.\nKeep in mind, we were still benefiting from the drawdown of networking backlog in Q1 of fiscal 2024. Operating margin of 24.4% was down 270 basis points year-over-year but up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to lower OpEx in line with our expectations.\nLastly, Financial Services. Our Financial Services business generated $893 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes increased 41% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $2.1 billion. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady near 0.5% and return on equity totaled 17%. Operating margin was 9.2%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\nMoving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, both of which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and increased collections. For the full year, free cash flow was a record $2.3 billion, above our guidance of $1.9 billion. Q4 cash conversion cycle was a negative 12 days, down 8 days from Q4 '23 and down 16 days from last quarter. Inventory ended the year at $7.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter due to the nature of our AI systems business. We are focused on reducing inventory during fiscal 2025 as we convert AI systems backlog and grow our storage business. During Q4, we returned $169 million via dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. We returned a total of $826 million during the full year.\nMoving to our outlook for fiscal Q1 2025. As Antonio said, we expect to close the Juniper transaction in early 2025, at which time we will provide combined company guidance for fiscal 2025. However, let me provide some high-level thoughts as to how we are thinking about the upcoming year. Overall, customer conversations indicate higher IT spending in 2025 with multiple tailwinds that should contribute to revenue growth. We expect continued recovery in traditional compute and growing adoption of AI systems by enterprises and sovereigns, although we expect orders to remain competitive and lumpy.\nIn Hybrid Cloud, we are beginning to see customers accelerate digital transformation projects in order to execute on AI strategies. And in networking, we expect demand will modestly recover throughout the year. For the first quarter, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. On a sequential basis, this is in line with normal seasonality. We expect server revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter.\nWe expect flat to modest growth sequentially in traditional compute and lower AI systems contribution following a very strong quarter. Server operating margin will be closer to 10% to 11% as customers navigate the transition to next-gen GPUs. In Hybrid Cloud, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to stronger-than-seasonal growth in Q4, with operating margin in the mid-single-digit range. And in networking, we are still managing prolonged sales cycles and expect the business to be around historical seasonality of flattish sequential growth. We expect Intelligent Edge operating margin to be in the low 20% range due to mix.\nGross margin will benefit from a more favorable revenue mix, and we expect a modest sequential decrease in OpEx. OI&E is expected to positively contribute to the bottom line with higher net interest income more than offsetting $0.02 of headwinds associated with the cost of our Juniper financing. Overall, we estimate Q1 GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.47 and $0.52 based on 1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding, including $76 million of dilution from our convertible preferred securities.\nFor free cash flow, we typically consume cash in the first quarter. We intend to procure components needed to meet current and future AI systems demand while continuing to manage inventory. For Q1, we intend to buy back shares of common stock at a similar pace to Q4. We remain committed in the long term to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and our investment-grade rating.\nIn summary, we delivered strong Q4 results and ended fiscal 2025 well positioned to drive profitable growth and generate free cash flow that we can reinvest into the business while also returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.",

My name is Gary, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jeff Kvaal, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nJeffrey Thomas Kvaal\n\nAnalyst, Instinet LLC\n\nGood afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and CEO; and Marie Myers, HPE's CFO. Let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our Investor Relations web page.\nElements of the financial information referenced on this call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.

Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared remarks. With that, Antonio?\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. HPE delivered a very solid performance in the second quarter with revenue and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exceeding our outlook range, driven by AI systems revenue more than doubling from our first quarter. I am very optimistic about where we are headed. AI demand continues to accelerate with cumulative AI systems orders reaching $4.6 billion this quarter.\nWe have a robust pipeline in this business, though large AI orders can cause fluctuations during the quarter. We anticipate continued revenue growth driven by increased AI systems demand, continued adoption of HPE GreenLake, and ongoing improvement in the traditional infrastructure market, including servers, storage and networking. Due to our confidence in the second half of fiscal year 2024, we are raising our full year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and reiterating free cash flow guidance. Marie will provide more specifics in her remarks.\nWhile we focus on translating strong AI customer demand to revenue growth, we continue to drive cost discipline to operate more efficiently and to preserve the ability to make targeted investments, which will sustain our growth into the future. We are being prudent with our spending and reduced operating expenses in the first half as compared to the prior year period. We're also driving business process simplification across the company, including through digitization and automation with AI.\nDemand for HPE's AI systems is accelerating at a faster pace, and our solid execution enabled us to more than double our AI systems revenue sequentially to over $900 million, helped by supply chain conversion through improved GPU availability. Our lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between 6 and 12 weeks depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year.\nEnterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with a number of enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year.\nWe are winning in AI for several reasons. Our leadership in AI at scale and across the entire AI life cycle from training to fine-tuning to inferencing continues to attract new customers. These customers range from new generative AI model builders to broader service providers, to sovereign states to traditional enterprise customers to large hyperscalers. For example, in partnership with Microsoft, we're extending the Azure AI platform to HPE infrastructure, which provides Microsoft with additional capacity to serve even more customers, including OpenAI.\nHPE has decades of experience in the design, manufacture and management of air- and liquid-cooled systems, including the data center infrastructure to reliably deliver the highest levels of computing performance. Customers appreciate our AI at scale expertise and intellectual property as well as unique liquid cooling manufacturing and services capabilities. As accelerated compute and silicon innovation advances, higher power density demand direct liquid cooling technologies.\nBuilding direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise, and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs.\nOur leadership in AI was once again validated in May when the latest top 500 list of the world's most power supercomputers was released. HPE now has 4 of the top 10 world's fastest supercomputers, all of which are direct liquid cooled. Two of these systems are exascale supercomputers with Frontier still the world's fastest and Aurora now breaking the exascale barrier.\nI'm also proud that we have built 7 of the world's top 10 energy-efficient systems according to the latest Green 500 list. This experience makes us an attractive partner to sovereign states and government pursuing AI strategies. HPE benefits from a strong ecosystem of AI partners, including NVIDIA. We introduced co-engineered enterprise solutions with NVIDIA last year to streamline the model development process as well as to enable enterprises to fine-tune large language models with their private data to accelerate infancy.\nI'm excited that NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, will join me at HPE Discover Las Vegas in just 2 weeks. Together, we will unveil new, exciting, and differentiated innovations that will simplify and accelerate enterprise AI adoption and deployment. Enterprise customers are already responding to our unique AI portfolio. For example, CUBOX, a facial and image recognition company in Korea, is developing new generative AI using HP AI systems to enhance identity verifications at locations such as the Incheon International Airport in South Korea.\nJT Group based in Japan operates a pharmaceutical business and is planning to use our HPE AI systems to support AI model training and simulation to accelerate drug discovery. And we just announced that we will power Scaleway's AI cloud service offering using our HPE AI systems. The new service will make powerful computing accessible to companies to support their various AI workloads and use cases.\nAs we capitalize on the AI growth opportunity, we also see indications of the market recovery in traditional and cloud infrastructure markets. Orders for traditional service grew sequentially and year-over-year, driven by enterprise public sector and SMB customers in North America and Europe. We are seeing no indication of cannibalization from accelerated computing demand. And revenue grew sequentially as customers transitioned to higher AUP, HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers.\nDifferentiated customer-centric innovation positions us well to capture this market recovery. For example, our leading HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud is attracting new customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the number of customer organizations using HPE GreenLake increased sequentially by almost 9% to 34,000. And our as-a-service lifetime over contract value grew to more than $15 billion in Q2, with our annualized revenue run rate or ARR growing 39% year-over-year.\nDemand is increasing for our HPE GreenLake on-premise private cloud solutions. The Defense Information Systems Agency, a combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense, selected HPE to develop a distributed hybrid multi-cloud platform prototype on HPE GreenLake as part of an effort to simplify the organization's management of disparate IT infrastructure and resources across public and private clouds.\nIn storage, we accelerated the transition of our portfolio in Q2 to meet the needs of hybrid cloud and AI. Several weeks ago, HPE introduced a significant new functionality to our HPE Alletra storage offerings. We rounded out our block offering by extending the hybrid capabilities of HPE Alletra block storage to AWS, doubling its capacity to address more customers and enhancing its automation capabilities with generative AI.\nEarlier this quarter, we introduced new HPE GreenLake for file storage capabilities, with options specifically targeting the unstructured data demands of AI. We have also added significant specialty sales capacity in recent months. While it takes time to activate new sellers and bring them to full productivity in a market with long sale cycles, we expect increased order to revenue conversion in the future.\nThe enhancement to our winning portfolio complemented by a more focused sales force within HPE to strengthen the already robust customer adoption of HPE Alletra. More than 1,000 new HPE Alletra MP systems have been deployed to date, which is the fastest product ramp in the history of our company.\nIn networking, the market remained in transition during the quarter as customers continued to work through their current inventory. As demand in this segment gradually returns, we believe our broad portfolio positions us well. We expect modest sequential network and demand improvement, driven by the state and local purchasing season in the United States.\nWe announced significant new innovations during the quarter to align with HPE's broader AI strategy. These solutions include generative AI capabilities to improve AIOps and WiFi 7 access points that capture edge data for AI inferencing. In addition, last month, we launched new security and AI observability tools to help fight AI cyber risks. And just yesterday, we expanded the most complete private 5G and WiFi portfolio in the market with the launch of HPE Aruba network in enterprise private 5G. All of this will be delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform.\nCustomers are responding to our network and innovation. In the last few months, customers ranging from Houston Airports to Health Group to Mercedes-Benz Stadium, to the University of Maryland have turned to HPE to enhance the experience for their visitors, residents, and employees. As we look to our future in networking, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks. We are currently in the regulatory process for this transaction and expect to close by the end of 2024 or early 2025.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in innovation while we drive operational and cost discipline to continue to improve our cost structure. We are focused on reducing complexity in our business processes as well as implementing automation and AI across the company to enhance customer service, R&D productivity, and team member overall experience.\nAlso want to note that we recently announced we have restructured the sale of our stake in H3C. Since the transaction is large and complex that require regulatory approvals, we have taken longer than previously anticipated. So we agreed to restructure the sale with Unis. The updated agreement provides HPE with the opportunity to sell a significant portion of the shares in the coming months. The new payment structure has no impact on the pending Juniper Networks transaction as the structure of the deal financing does not rely on any of the H3C proceeds.\nFinally, you likely saw that we announced in May that we have agreed to divest our communications technology group to enhance our strategic focus in high-growth, high-margin parts of the market, including the service provider and enterprise markets. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm proud of the very solid performance in Q2. It shows the alignment of our strategy and innovation to major market opportunities. We have greater optimism about the second half of the year, leading us to raise our full year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance.\nAI is creating growing demand across our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities across customer and business segments. Our competitive advantages from deep expertise in standing up AI systems to our differentiated HPE GreenLake cloud to our networking storage offerings position us well. We have an excellent team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue executing with discipline to take advantage of incredible opportunities presented by this area of innovation.\nI am looking forward to sharing with you our latest breakthrough innovation and partnerships across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking later this month at HPE Discover Las Vegas. We are very excited to be the first corporate keynote this year, and I hope to see many of you there. I would like now to hand it over to Marie, who will talk about the details of our segments and our outlook. Marie, over to you.\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you after my first full quarter as HPE's CFO. Over the past 3 months, I have become even more excited about our opportunities across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. We remain in the very early days of AI, yet it is already driving strong interest, pipeline orders and revenue across our portfolio from servers to storage to services to financing.\nOur AI system revenue inflected positively in Q2. We are winning deals in the AI market now and are well positioned for additional demand from enterprises and sovereigns in the future. Our differentiation includes decades of liquid cooling expertise, which we expect to become even more in demand with future iterations of chips, including NVIDIA's. In short, we see AI as a long-term driver of our financial results and is a pillar of our strategy to pursue higher-growth, higher-margin revenues.\nWe are very pleased that we have exceeded our expectations in Q2 across key metrics. We exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $400 million. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS was above the high end of our range, and free cash flow exceeded $600 million. Improving enterprise demand for traditional servers on top of the expected sharp ramp in AI servers drove the outperformance. Our AI orders are healthy. Intelligent Edge is set to grow sequentially beyond Q2 as expected, and AI emerged as a driver of a healthy HPE GreenLake momentum. We are seeing rapid growth in AI system revenue. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance in Q2, and I'm excited about our continued progress through fiscal '24.\nLet's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.2 billion. This exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by approximately $400 million. We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. The number of customers that have adopted HPE GreenLake rose 9% sequentially. ARR grew 39% year-over-year to above $1.5 billion in Q2. Storage and networking are typically the fastest growth elements of ARR and both retain robust growth rates.\nThis quarter, AI was the fastest growth component of ARR. Our software and services mix rose approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 67%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a key differentiator. We expect HPE GreenLake's value proposition to key customers, including enterprises and sovereigns, to sharpen with the advent of AI.\nOur Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 33.1%, which was down 310 basis points sequentially and year-over-year, driven by a mix shift from our higher-margin Intelligent Edge revenue to server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud. At Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses fell 1.6% year-over-year despite our revenue growth of 4%. Our OpEx discipline partially offset lower non-GAAP gross margins and held the non-GAAP operating margin decline to 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year to 9.5%. The OpEx discipline plus higher revenue drove GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42. The latter exceeded the high end of the guidance range on strong revenue and cost discipline.\nAnd non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $247 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisitions, and other related challenges. We are managing the business with focus and discipline and evolving into a simpler, more agile company. We are also investing to capitalize on growth from the interrelated inflection points of AI, hybrid cloud, and networking and to drive structurally higher profitability over time.\nLet's turn to our segment results. Server revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter. This was up 16% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Strengths in both AI systems and traditional servers drove the healthy revenue growth. Our cumulative AI system product and service orders since Q1 '23 rose approximately $600 million sequentially to $4.6 billion. I am very pleased with our AI system product revenue more than doubled sequentially to over $900 million. This strong revenue growth allowed us to make progress against our backlog, which is now $3.1 billion.\nGiven the growing importance of our services business, we have updated our AI disclosures for this quarter to include services. Services is a small portion of our AI systems metrics at present, though we expect it to become more meaningful over time. Our differentiation with liquid cooling, software, HPE GreenLake and, increasingly, services is resonating in the market. We have seen a threefold increase in our enterprise AI customer base in the past year.\nRevenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue. Demand is improving as enterprises digest prior purchases and gain more comfort with the macro outlook. Structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 servers is ahead of our expectations, and we are able to pass through rising input costs. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications, and we see more evidence of adoption in the enterprise in Q2.\nOur Q2 operating margin was 11%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially and was in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter for our operating margins to the lower end of our long-term 11% to 13% range. While pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems, we remain disciplined in cost and price as we pursue profitable growth.\nHybrid cloud revenues of $1.3 billion were up 1% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. We are already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. I mentioned a 39% growth in ARR this quarter. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year. The business is managing 2 long-term transitions at once. We talked about our migration to the more software-intensive Alletra platform. This is reducing current period revenue growth so locking in future recurring revenue. Storage ARR growth of over 50% year-over-year offers early confidence into the migration.\nThe second transition is from block storage to file storage driven by AI. While early, this is also on the right trajectory. Our new file offerings plus the sales force investment Antonio mentioned tripled our pipeline of file storage deals sequentially in Q2. Our operating margin was 0.8%, which was down 300 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points year-over-year. Reduced revenue scale and an unfavorable mix of third-party products and traditional storage was the largest driver of the sequential change.\nIntelligent Edge revenues were $1.1 billion. Revenues fell 9% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Backlog consumption created difficult compares with both prior periods. Our backlog is now at normal levels. The demand environment remains soft and large enterprises have yet to return to the market in force. However, we do see some green shoots that give us confidence in networking will transition to modest sequential growth beyond Q2 as we had expected.\nOur channel inventory remains within the normal range. WiFi has grown sequentially for 2 consecutive quarters. Growth remains strong in software and services. Attach rates and renewals for Aruba Central, SASE and our AIOps software remains strong. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew above 50% year-over-year. The segment operating margin of 21.8% was down 760 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. As expected, the lower revenues, reduced mix of switching business and the less revenue from backlog were the primary drivers.\nAs we indicated last quarter, we have reset our OpEx plan for the year to account for lower revenue and expect the Intelligent Edge operating margin to be back in the mid-20% range by Q4. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and financing volume was $1.7 billion. Our operating margin of 9.3% was up 80 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. Our Q2 loss ratio remained steady below 0.5%.\nThese results are what we have come to expect from this high-quality, predictable business. However, underneath these steady results, FS is already adapting to drive AI growth across the business. Year-to-date, nearly $0.5 billion of our $3 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers. This illustrates our prior point that AI is driving demand to every one of our businesses.\nTurning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal '24, given higher-than-expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments.\nOur cash conversion cycle was negative 4 days, which is a reduction of 28 days from Q2 '23. Our days of inventory and days payable were both higher to support our expected growth in AI system revenue in the second half. We returned $240 million in capital to shareholders in Q2, including $169 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases. Our year-to-date capital return is $386 million.\nLet's turn now to our forward view. We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake. Let me recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q3 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply for AI systems and improving demand for traditional servers to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year '24.\nWhile the rising AI systems mix is a gross margin headwind, we are balancing this with higher-margin services revenue, improving scale and cost discipline. We expect the segment operating margin to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. For hybrid cloud, we expect slight sequential revenue increases throughout the year. HPE GreenLake growth should continue and traditional storage should improve slightly. We expect operating margin to improve modestly to the mid-single-digit range through the year as HPE GreenLake deals mature, new products ramp, and our sales force optimization gathers momentum.\nFor Intelligent Edge, we anticipate a slight sequential growth in Q3 and Q4, driven primarily by seasonal education spending rather than improving markets. We continue to expect our cost reduction efforts to materialize in the second half and our full year operating margin to be in the mid-20% range.\nWith that context, let me now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.29 and $0.34, and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.43 and $0.48. For fiscal year '24, we now expect constant currency revenue growth of 1% to 3%, which is up from our prior 0% to 2% range.\nWe reiterate our non-GAAP operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We are reducing our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance by $0.20 to $1.61 to $1.71 to incorporate the recent updates to our H3C proceeds. We are raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance up $0.03 to $1.85 to $1.95. This incremental $0.03 or $0.06 annualized reflects the contribution from the retained portion of our H3C stake. We are also increasingly comfortable with the high end of the non-GAAP diluted net EPS range, given our OI&E and operational improvement.\nWe are excluding from our non-GAAP results the gain on sale from our H3C and CTG divestments. This year's mix shift from networking to AI systems should weigh on our gross margins. We expect the fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin to be below our full year expectation of 35% from our Analyst Day. To balance the mix shift, we are driving further simplicity and efficiency across the business. We are accelerating our generative AI capabilities such as implementing HPE-specific large language models and chatbots for our sales and service representatives.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, prudent cost management, simplified processes, and disciplined execution across cycles are key tenets of our long-term journey towards higher margins. These cost actions will be evident in financial results in the second half of fiscal '24. We now expect fiscal year '24 OpEx to be down modestly from fiscal '23 OpEx. Our prior view was flat to down. This includes a sequential increase in Q3 for marketing before a sequentially lower Q4, which will serve us well heading into fiscal '25.\nWe expect our fiscal '24 operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be less of a headwind this year. We anticipate $150 million headwind versus our prior expectation of a $200 million to $250 million headwind, given a onetime benefit in Q2 and the retained portion of our H3C stake. We expect the effect of currency to be immaterial.\nOur strong first half free cash flow increases our confidence that we will deliver at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by higher earnings, given our ramp in AI systems. This does not include the $2.1 billion that we expect to receive from Unisplendour this fiscal year as a result of our recently restructured agreement to sell our stake in H3C. We expect working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory to balance declines in accounts payable.\nWe remain committed in the long term to our balanced capital allocation framework, including our target of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q2 as we prudently manage our balance sheet ahead of the anticipated receipt of the H3C proceeds and the Juniper transaction closing. The proposed Juniper deal remains on track to close in late 2024 or early '25 as planned. We remain committed to our dividend and to our investment-grade rating.\nTo conclude, our solid Q2 results illustrate how comprehensively AI is affecting our portfolio. We are capturing profitable growth opportunities in the AI market. We are excited to discover and look forward to seeing many of you at our IR Summit. I'll open it up now for your questions.",

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we are proud to have outpaced our profitability expectations while advancing our long-term strategy. We also continue to scale our recurring revenue, achieving the second highest year-over-year growth rate since we started tracking ARR in late 2019. This is a promising indicator for our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin revenues. But overall, Q1 revenue performance did not meet our expectations.\nDuring this call, I will address 3 key points. First, I will touch on our revenue, which was lower than expected in large part because network and demand softened industry-wide and because the timing of several large GPU acceptances shifted. Additionally, we did not have the GPU supply we wanted, curtailing our revenue upside. Second, I will address how we are streamlining our reporting segments, accelerating a new specialized sales model, managing our spending and reinforcing execution discipline. Third and most importantly, I will discuss the progress we're making in executing our long-term strategy, which we remain confident in.\nLet me first address revenue in the quarter. Similar to peers in the market, we saw campus networking product demand weakened and the decline later in the quarter was greater than expected. This was a large headwind relative to our expectations. Customers are taking longer to digest prior orders than we had anticipated, which partially offset the benefit of our backlog entering the quarter. And Europe and Asia were areas of relative softness. We expect weakness in the networking market to persist, which is likely to impact revenue through fiscal year 2024.\nThat said, we anticipate some improvement late in fiscal year 2024 as inventory clears and we ramp into the purchasing season for state and local education customers in the United States. AI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems. As a result, overall AI server orders conversion was below our expectations. However, the AI contribution to ARR is increasing.\nWe continue to prioritize profitability. I am pleased that we have delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 36.2%, which is up 200 basis points year-over-year and above 600 basis points from fiscal year 2018. This performance helped our Q1 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share grow to $0.48, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range despite lower-than-expected revenue, illustrating the positive impact of our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue. We know that the current environment will require continued discipline in how we execute. We are accelerating new specialized sales motions to maximize opportunities and improve order linearity across our portfolio. Improved cost management will remain an important competency for us in fiscal year 2024.\nWe also found opportunity to streamline our reporting segments. We have now combined the Compute and HPC and AI segments into a single server segment that integrates general-purpose computing, high-performance computing, supercomputing, and AI systems. This will enable us to maximize the opportunities across the entire AI life cycle, from training to tuning to inferencing and execute with agility. And as previously discussed, we have simplified our hybrid cloud strategy by putting all related products, software and services into 1 business unit. Our new hybrid cloud segment will further accelerate customer adoption of the HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform.\nTurning to our strategy. While we are experiencing cyclicality in submarkets, I am more confident than ever in our long-term strategy that is aligned to key market mega trends. In edge, over the last several quarters, we have gained share in the campus networking markets and our strategic investments have played off. Most recently, we have seen strong growth in SASE, an offering bolstered by our acquisition of Silver Peak in 2020 and Axis Security in 2023. Our sales pipeline for our private 5G offering is also growing rapidly, following our acquisition of Athonet in 2023.\nIn hybrid cloud, HPE GreenLake continues to resonate in the marketplace and was the private driver of the highest Q1 year-over-year rise in ARR over the 4-plus years we have been reporting it. Our ARR grew 41% year-over-year to more than $1.4 billion in Q1, and we continue to expect ARR growth of 35% to 45% as we look ahead. We're also capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities when customers come to us for our AI solutions and realize we can meet their storage needs as well.\nIn AI, we are capturing the explosion in demand for AI systems. Our cumulative accelerator processing unit orders rose to $4 billion in the quarter, driven by demand across HPE Cray EX and XT solutions, as well as HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI-optimized servers. AP orders represent nearly 25% of our total server orders since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our pipeline is large and growing across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. We are starting to see AI demand pull-through for other solutions, including storage.\nWe expect our server and hybrid cloud segments to grow sequentially through the fiscal year. Server revenue stands to benefit from AI system demand, improving GPU supply, and our continued mix shift to HPE ProLiant Gen11. Hybrid cloud will benefit from continued HPE GreenLake storage demand and the rising productivity of our specialized sales force. Our customers continue to validate our value proposition. As 1 example, we are building for A&E, one of the world's largest energy providers, a new HPE Cray EX supercomputer that will reach more than half an exaflop performance. The system will be one of the most powerful in the world for enterprise use and will accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery to advance efforts in energy.\nWe also have been awarded the deal for Poland's most powerful supercomputer system located at the Academic Computer Center Cipher Net of the AGH University of Science and Technology. Based on the HPE Cray EX supercomputer and HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs, the system will be used to support modeling simulation and AI-driven scientific research needs, including training and tuning of large language models.\nWe're also seeing growth in AI inferencing. For example, Coles Supermarkets, a leading Australian retailer, implemented an HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI inferencing solution in Q1, which helps with video imaging to reduce store stock lost to theft and scanning at the checkout. In the quarter, we expanded our strategic collaboration with NVIDIA targeting the [indiscernible] segment of the market. We introduced a preconfigured solution for enterprise customers to fine-tune AI large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. Our HPE machine learning development environment software and unique HPE supercomputer and IP are critical parts of the solution, alongside NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We have built a strong and growing sales pipeline for this new offering.\nWe also continue to build out our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform services. Earlier this quarter, we announced an expanded HPE GreenLake for file storage that is designed for generative AI. This solution is highly differentiated through a high-performant file system solution specifically designed for AI applications. We believe it better positions us to take market share in storage by addressing the previously underserved segment of the file market. Innovation like this continue to attract customers to HPE GreenLake platform, which connects 3.8 million network devices and supports more than 31,000 customer organizations, up approximately 8% from last quarter.\nOne new HPE GreenLake customer is the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, which produces critical models of weather and ocean conditions for the U.S. and coalition forces worldwide. They turned to HPE GreenLake to improve predictability, accuracy and speed of their modeling while reducing costs. This week, I attended the Mobile World Congress where AI and private 5G were the key topics among telcos and service providers alike. With our pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, HPE's portfolio will expand to better serve these unique customers from the edge of the network to core 5G to cloud.\nCustomers were very interested in our integration of Athonet private 5G capabilities into our Intelligent Edge portfolio as well as in our cloud OpenRAN and VRAN solutions. They were also very eager to explore the massive new market opportunity AI inferencing presents at the edge of the network. That is one of the reasons why we're so excited about our pending Juniper Networks acquisition. Combining our complementary portfolios will supercharge HPE's edge-to-cloud strategy, accelerating our entire portfolio with AI-enabled innovation. When our proposed acquisition closes, we will create a new networking innovator, with our comprehensive portfolio for and partners.\nThe transaction is expected to double the size of our networking business, which will be the core foundation of covering the anticipated $180 billion market opportunity with our combined IP. From a financial perspective, this transaction is also compelling for our shareholders. In the first year post close, we expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share and, in the long term, higher non-GAAP gross and operating margins. We are working to secure regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions. We are hopeful that regulators will recognize that this acquisition is centered around driving further innovation for our customers. We continue to expect that the transaction will close later this calendar year or in early calendar 2025.\nIn summary, Q1 2024 was a mixed quarter for HPE. We achieved strong profitability and drove new record ARR growth with overall revenue short-term expectations, given the softening networking market, GPU deal timing and, to some extent, GPU availability. We are focused on execution as we navigate the fluctuations demand we see in certain areas of the market. Marie will take you through our adjusted guidance, which reflects our latest thinking about the year ahead.\nThis quarter is a moment in time and does not at all dampen our confidence in the future ahead of us. We have taken the right actions to maximize value for our shareholders. The work we are doing now, combined with our technological edge and our strategy that has never been more relevant, will position us to convert on the long-term opportunities in front of us across edge, hybrid cloud, and AI.\nBefore we transition, I'm delighted to welcome Marie Myers as our new CFO. Having worked with her at HP before the separation, it is a pleasure to partner with her again. I am passion for and skill ad, fueling innovation and performance. I am confident that Marie is a great fit for this role and expect she will help drive the next phase of growth and shareholder return for HPE. I will now turn the call over to her for details about our segments and our outlook. Marie?\n\nMarie E. Myers\n\nCFO, HP Inc.\n\nThank you, Antonio. I'm pleased to be with you today on my first earnings call as HPE's CFO. I've long admired HPE's impressive transformation, and there has never been a more exciting time to be part of this company. We have a growing addressable market, a proven strategy and a differentiated portfolio that is levered to long-term market trends around networking, hybrid cloud and AI. I believe we have a significant opportunity ahead of us. I'm excited to partner with Antonio and the rest of the outstanding HPE team to capitalize on this opportunity and drive value for our shareholders.\nAnd as Antonio mentioned, we have much to be proud of. Financial highlights in the quarter included record gross margins and expense discipline, which helped lift non-GAAP EPS to the high end of our guidance range. Demand for our traditional server and storage products has stabilized. Demand for our HPE GreenLake offerings was evident in a healthy ARR growth and demand for our AI systems remains robust. However, demand in Intelligent Edge did soften due to customer digestion of strong product shipments in fiscal year '23, which is lasting longer than we initially anticipated and is the primary reason Q1 revenue came in below our expectations. GPU availability and deal timing also contributed. We are taking swift action to address these headwinds by curtailing costs and driving efficiencies across the business.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue fell 14% year-over-year in constant currency to $6.8 billion. Please recall, we had significant backlog consumption in Q1 '23, particularly in traditional servers and storage. Backlog has now largely normalized across our business with the exception of our APU products. We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. ARR exceeded $1.4 billion in Q1. Storage and networking software and services are the fastest growth elements of ARR. Our software and services mix rose 400 basis points year-over-year to 69%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a differentiated value proposition in the market.\nOur Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 36.2%. It rose 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by a mix shift to Intelligent Edge and favorable input cost management. We are pleased that our non-GAAP gross margin is up 600 basis points from fiscal year '18 to a company record. This illustrates the ongoing pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue across our portfolio. Given the current networking market dynamics, we are taking this moment to streamline and simplify our operations. We are focused on controlling the things we can control. Prudent cost management and disciplined execution are important regardless of the macro environment and are even more critical at times like these.\nThe benefits of our focus are already evident in our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses, which declined 4.7% year-over-year at 9.5% sequentially to $1.7 billion. The strong Q1 non-GAAP gross margins and OpEx discipline led to Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of 11.5%, which is down only 30 basis points year-over-year despite less revenue scale. Favorable timing on some corporate expenses was a tailwind to Q1 operating expense and will appear in Q2. GAAP EPS of $0.29 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Our diluted share count was approximately 1.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude $251 million in costs primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and noncash loss on investments.\nAs we manage the business with focus and discipline, we will also invest to capitalize on the sizable opportunities associated with moving through the interrelated inflection points in networking, hybrid cloud, and AI all at the same time. HPE is evolving into a more simple, more agile company that is even better positioned to pursue our growth opportunities and to evolve our mix of products, services and software and to drive structural higher profitability.\nTurning to our segment results. In addition to the new segments we discussed at SAM, we also created a new service segment that combines our prior compute and HPC and AI segment under 1 streamlined segment that offers solutions for our customers' training, tuning, and inferencing AI needs across the AI life cycle. Server revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year. This new segment had a difficult year-over-year compare as in Q1 '23, the business made significant progress against its backlog and benefit from HPE Cray EX revenue for Frontier.\nWe are capturing the robust growth in AI demand. Our cumulative APU orders since Q1 '23, which include APU attached products and services in our HPE Cray EX XD and ProLiant Systems, rose approximately sequentially to now $4 billion. Our pipeline is robust and GPU supply, while still constrained, is improving. Our APU product revenue increased sequentially to well over $400 million. We are now converting our APU orders into revenues, and yet very strong demand means our APU backlog is over $3 billion. Our pipeline is well above that.\nAI revenue in the quarter included our first revenues from AI cloud offering and from our HPE GreenLake win with a large hyperscale customer. Our traditional high-performance computing and supercomputing revenue fell seasonally, sequentially following a strong Q4. Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue, given a structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 and rising input costs. General servers nearly doubled sequentially to 30% of the mix in Q1. Including HPE, Cray XD takes the mix of next-generation servers to 44%. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications. We expect AI inferencing to gather momentum in fiscal year '24.\nAs a reminder, our Gen11 services come with an attached subscription to our compute ops management software, which lifts our margin structure. Our Q1 operating margin was 11.4%. While up sequentially, the margin was down 430 basis points year-over-year, given declining revenues. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.2 billion or up 2% year-over-year. Demand for our campus switching and WiFi products eased materially, particularly in Europe and Asia, and was the largest contributor to our Q1 revenue gap. We continue to see mid-single-digit growth benefits from our existing backlog but expect it to normalize going forward as we are now approaching our typical range.\nOur total channel inventory is within the normal range overall, inclusive of a pocket in the SMB business. We also continue to make progress in our new TAMs of data center networking, private 5G and SASE. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew well above 50% as we are benefiting from growing attach from our strong fiscal year '23 revenue growth. We are pleased with our 29.4% operating margin, which was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. The new hybrid cloud segment includes our storage businesses and now the HPE GreenLake portion of our server business. Revenues of $1.2 billion were down 10% year-over-year.\nOur traditional storage business was down year-over-year on difficult compares, given backlog consumption in Q1 '23. Total electro subscription revenue grew over 100% year-over-year and is an illustration of our long-term transition to an as-a-service model across our businesses. We are starting to see AI server demand pull through interest in our file storage portfolio. We are also already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit.\nOur operating margin was 3.8%, which was down 200 basis points year-over-year. Lower revenues and a high mix of third-party product impacted margins in the traditional storage business. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year and financing volume was $1.4 billion. Our operating margin of 8.5% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We are successfully passing through interest rate increases, and our asset management margins are returning to normal. Our Q1 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%.\nTurning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $64 million in cash flow from operations and consumed $482 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half. Our first quarter free cash flow benefited from some prepayments associated with pending HPE GreenLake deals at HPE Cray XD shipments. Our cash conversion cycle was 7 days, which is a reduction of 8 days from Q1 '23. Our days payable and days of inventory were both higher, given the lower revenue and strong demand for APUs. We returned $172 million in capital to shareholders in Q1, primarily through our dividend.\nBefore I discuss our outlook, let me first recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q2 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year '24. Given improving supply and the timing of installations, we expect segment revenue and therefore, corporate revenue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect the blended margin of the new segment to be flattish for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nFor Intelligent Edge, we expect the market to remain soft throughout the year. Our cost reduction efforts will take time to show their benefits, which will result in margin pressure in Q2. Later in our fiscal year, we expect our normal channel inventory position and seasonal strength in the education market to be a modest revenue tailwind. We expect the full year margin to be in the mid-20% range. For hybrid cloud, we expect sequential increases through the year as our traditional storage business improves and HPE GreenLake momentum continues. We expect meaningful progress through the year.\nWith that context, let me turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $6.6 billion to $7 billion or up slightly sequentially at the midpoint. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.20 and $0.25 and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.41. In part, given the higher prepayments in Q1, we expect negative free cash flow in Q2. Let me remind you that we have 2 drivers of potential lumpiness in our business: one is the timing and customer acceptances of large Cray wins, including Cray XD wins, which should ramp beginning in Q2. The second is the start of certain large HPE GreenLake deals. For some of these large deals, our segments recognize the related hardware on installation. In our consolidated results, we eliminate the segment revenue and recognize it over time.\nBoth large deals and higher eliminations are indicators of our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year. For fiscal year '24, we are revising our outlook, primarily given the current networking market headwinds. Let me remind you that we are excluding the H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results beginning in fiscal year '24. We now expect revised ranges for constant currency revenue and non-GAAP operating profit growth of 0% to 2%. GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.81 to $1.91 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.82 to $1.92.\nThe mix shift from Intelligent Edge to server should also weigh on our gross margins. We now expect the full year non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly down from our prior full year expectation of 35%. We expect the impact of the cost actions we have initiated to materialize in the second half and leave fiscal year '24 OpEx to be flat to down from fiscal '23 OpEx. We expect our operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be $200 million to $250 million headwind versus our prior $300 million expectation, given better Q1 free cash flow and more favorable interest rate assumptions.\nWe expect the effect on currency to be immaterial. We expect free cash flow to be at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by improvements in inventories as AI service shipments ramp. We reiterate our commitment to our dividend, which was raised 8% from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Debt repayment to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, and in long term, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nTo conclude, we executed well in Q1 amidst a challenging market backdrop. We are pleased with our margin and EPS results while understanding our slower networking product demand and GPU availability and timing impacted our revenue performance. We have taken prompt action to further reduce our costs and continue to manage our expenses prudently while we advance our long-term strategy. AI server demand is strong. Demand has stabilized for our traditional server and storage products, and our HPE GreenLake momentum is robust.\nWe will continue to invest in IT inflections, networking, hybrid cloud and AI to drive our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue. I look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead, as does our new Chief Strategy Officer, Shannon Cross, who has joined us following a distinguished career as a Wall Street analyst and now has oversight of our IR function. We will appreciate your input and questions along the way, and we can get started with that right now. I'll open it up now for your questions about the quarter.",

In fiscal year 2023, HP delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue, further gross margin expansion, larger operating profit and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI as well as our HPE Clinic platform are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly, HP has achieved a multiple success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin areas aligned to the key market mega trends driving customer demand. I will focus my commentary today on our full year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HP delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders, our customers and our team members.\nOur performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy, our portfolio differentiation and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers, resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HP generated our highest gross margin and operating profit since I became CEO, and our highest annual revenue in 4 years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history. We saw healthy sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full year, an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, a third straight year of revenue growth point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercise prudence with our expenses and obligations.\nNon-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flow, which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion and nearly 25% year-over-year increase. Both non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022, some guidance. In summary, HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and our confidence in generating further value for our shareholders, we are raising our dividend in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge, hybrid cloud and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interest and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we saw continued though uneven demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders. Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services.\nIn Q4, orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs, represented 32% of our total server order mix, up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC and AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC and AI order book on record driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. These stops what has been a historically large order book in the third quarter as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions. We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog until GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago, at the Supercomputing Conference, we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configure supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using private data sets, designed for large enterprises, research institution and government organizations.\nIt comprises HPE AI software or industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions, our HP Slingshot interconnect fabric and HPE services and the Quad NVIDIA Grayfer GH 200 super chip. Later this week, at the HP Discover Barcelona, we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers. Also this month, the University of Bristol announced that HP has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer, thanks to our U.K. government investment of GBP 225 million intended to make the nation award leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process, translate and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HP creates supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite.\nWith HPE built supercomputers consistently rank among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers, our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market. Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023, making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion, while operating margins expanded more than 1,200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments, making this a price-competitive market for now. As we prepared to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities, we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment.\nCustomer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However, we are encouraged with 3 quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities. We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force, including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated our products like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29,000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform.\nCustomers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience, flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter, we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to date. In addition, we saw more customer demand around our HP GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection, observability and sustainability services. Finally, our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP, one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons: First, the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other ; Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make, we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way; And finally, we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company.\nThe changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment, focus on our road maps across the portfolio, create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders. While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market, HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum, and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy, over to you.\n\nJeremy K. Cox\n\nSenior VP, Controller, Chief Tax Officer, Principal Account Officer & Interim CFO\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth, higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023, we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue, however, was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22, during which significant order book consumption boosted our results. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8%, which was up 170 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM, which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period.\nThe impact of this investment, along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52. Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.\nLet's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure. And as communicated at SAM, we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion, but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1,600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance, we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally, we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024. In HPC and AI, Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially.\nQ4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis, the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC and AI segment to more than $3 billion, despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next 3 years, and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make, this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC and AI margins will fluctuate. Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare, but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for 3 straight quarters. HP Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24, supported by growth in file and object storage.\nHP Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software, accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens. Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion, we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However, two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook.\nOur full year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13%, but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion. Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin recurring revenue and in particular, to Intelligent Edge. Even 3 years ago, the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year, it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit 3 years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23.\nIn FY '24, we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI, hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments. Within that, we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC and AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth, which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Ed software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services, which rose double digits in Q4. The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins.\nOur as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale, we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY '24. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders, which include APUs in our compute, CrayEX and CrayXD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23, which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4, reaching $2.4 billion for the year. The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '20, up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However, orders can be easily north of $100 million each, therefore, orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing.\nOur strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds, a we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018, while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4, we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22, primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative 4 days, which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 and drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23.\nContinued progress in FY '24 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY '24 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY '23, including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY '23, we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% and of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook, let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first half of calendar 2024. For Q1, we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business, including in the HPC and AI segment after its strong Q4.\nWe expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC and AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E, which as noted, excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Full year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24. We are reiterating our full year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.02 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year.\nSo to conclude, while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market, our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design. Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform, our AI native portfolio, and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions.",

With that, let me turn to you, Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nAll right. Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. HPE delivered another solid quarter. We again increased our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow. Our results are being driven by our intentional ongoing mix shift to higher growth, higher-margin parts of our portfolio that are critical priorities to customers. Our success in shifting the portfolio delivered 120 basis points year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin expansion, driven by exceptional performance in areas like the Intelligent Edge, where revenue has set its fifth consecutive record quarter and HPE GreenLake, which continued to accelerate our strategic pivot, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our 4 product segments, driven by the increased mix of high-margin software and services.\nIn Q3, our Intelligent Edge business contributed 20% of our total company revenue. It is now the largest source of HPE's operating profit at 49% of our total segment operating profit. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform is accelerating our other service pivots, delivering an annualized revenue run rate or ARR, of $1.3 billion, a 48% increase year-over-year. Our strategic shift toward edge hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform is working, and we are delivering on our financial commitments.\nBecause of our momentum and strong execution throughout this fiscal year and once again, we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. GAAP for full year diluted net earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged. For non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, we're increasing to $2.30 at the midpoint, while maintaining both our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 4% to 6% and full year free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.\nWe will provide more details later in our call today, including on a GAAP basis. Our view of the macro environment remains unchanged from recent months. Customers continue to prioritize their data first digital transformation despite some reservations about the macroeconomic environment for the future. While the broader IT market is still pressured, demand for our product and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all key segments of our business, driven by high-growth areas like AI and HP GreenLake.\nWe continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers, who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment as customers discover HPE's unique capabilities to power unprecedented level of performance for AI at scale, including using our market-leading supercomputers built with sustainability in mind to train and tune their AI models.\nTotal HPE revenue during the third quarter increased 3.5% year-over-year to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter. Higher profitability in the third quarter compared to last year also corresponded to an increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which was $0.49, up 2% year-over-year. And we generated $955 million in free cash flow, an increase of nearly $370 million.\nThe HP GreenLake Cloud platform is a key driver of financial performance, with our hybrid cloud offerings through the platform continue to attract new customers and compel existing customers to expand their contracts. HP GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in our as-a-service total contract value since last quarter. Our cumulative booked total contract value now stands at just under $12 billion. The scale and the strength of HPE GreenLake is evident. It supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices and more than 1,100 partners sell HP GreenLake, 1 of the largest partner ecosystems selling as-a-service offerings in the industry.\nAs we grow our ARR, we are also increasing its share of high-margin software and services. Software and services increased 2 percentage points sequentially to 68% of the total ARR mix compared to 66% in the second quarter, with ongoing contributions from SaaS offerings tied to our HPE as software, Storage and HP Aruba networking, our operational services and OpsRamp, our recent acquisition. We are well positioned to continue to grow the software and services mix within our ARR. For example, we saw a double-digit increase in demand with HPE operational services this quarter, which will contribute to future recurring revenues.\nThe impressive gross margin in our as-a-Service recurring revenues helped lift our already strong overall company gross margin this quarter. These results demonstrate the relevance of our differentiated HP GreenLake value proposition of providing 1 unified hybrid cloud experience to empower customers to access analyze and extract value from their data, no matter where it lies at the Edge in the colos or data center and in the public cloud.\nNow I would like to highlight a few important takeaways in our business segment results. First, as I said earlier, HPE's performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 53% year-over-year and operating profit more than doubled, in another exceptional quarter for this business segment. I'm particularly pleased that our Intelligent Edge SaaS revenues continue to climb double digits. We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, high shipment volume and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue.\nMomentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double digits in all regions in the third quarter. One example is the University of Maryland, which wanted a stronger cloud-based policy-driven wire and wireless network that could provide improved automation, better device visibility and easier and more secure access for students, faculty and staff as they are returning to campus. The University selected HPE Aruba Networking for a campus-wide refresh to enhance the flexibility, visibility and security of its network through HPE Aruba Clear Pass, our SaaS platform to onboard new devices, grant varying access levels and keep network secure.\nThe HPC & AI business segment saw a way for demand deceleration in the quarter as we converted on AI deal opportunities and ship orders that leverage a unique end-to-end AI value proposition, from training to tuning to inference. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum also helped grow our total HPE order book which is now at more than 2x pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions and sequential demand improvements across our 4 product segments.\nOnly HPE can combine our unique AI software and Slingshot networking fabric, HPE services offerings and market-leading sustainable supercomputers. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers who are turning to us for a full spectrum of enterprise AI and use cases span a large-scale model development, training, tuning and interesting. Through the U.K.'s GW4 Alliance of 4 U.K. research universities, HPE won a contract from the U.K. research and innovation to develop is 3, a supercomputer that leverages the latest HP XC supercomputers, HP Slingshot Interconnect and NVIDIA Grace GPU Super Chip.\nThe system will provide researchers, engineers and data scientists, purpose-built capabilities to train AI models and accelerate research in clean energy, drug discovery, medical diagnosis and astrophysics. In addition, we were selected by Tokyo Institute of Technology Global Scientific Information and Computing Center to build its next-generation supercomputer, which is called Subami 4.0, which includes AMD CPUs and MDS GPUs to accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery in medicine, material science and climate research.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, is a leading public tech bio company that uses advancement in AI to accelerate and industrialize the discovery of new drugs. Recursion turned to HPE's AI software to scale its foundation model efforts, significantly speed up training across its more than 25 petabytes of biological and chemical data and improve team collaboration. We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the Lumi supercomputer built by HPE with AMD CPUs and GPUs is the fastest system in Europe and the third fastest in the world. It has enabled generative AI projects such as creating the world's largest finished language model, and it has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers.\nWe continue to make progress in ushering in the area of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE in collaboration with the Laurence Libero Natural Laboratory started to build and test El Capitan, 1 of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which uses AMD CPUs and GPUs is expected to reach 2 exaflop optic performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives.\nWe are seeing demand improving in both our Storage and Compute segments. Storage demand was solid year-over-year with a cloud-native HPE Alletra portfolio recording triple-digit revenue growth. Storage SaaS revenue also increased double digits as we continue to intentionally drive more of HPE's Alletra own IP through HPE GreenLake. Compute performed well considering the sector ongoing cyclicality. We saw sequential unit demand increase in the quarter. One area where we anticipate demand picking up in the coming quarters is customers seeking a solution to run AI inference workloads.\nOur new HPE ProLiant Gen 11 servers optimized for AI loads are well positioned for this growing customer need. During the third quarter, we started shipping these servers, which boost AI inference performance by more than 5x over previous models. And just last week, we expanded our portfolio for enterprise tuning and inference solutions with NVIDIA and VMware to accelerate our customers' generative AI deployments.\nTo round out our major segments in HPE Financial Services, revenue climbed 7% year-over-year and financing volume ticked up 6%. HPE Financial Services continues to be strategically important as we continue to ramp up our as-a-service volumes through HPE GreenLake. We continue to strengthen our innovation from edge to cloud, position HPE World for the future. In June, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at our annual HPE Discovery event, where we unbuild exciting new edge hybrid cloud and AI solutions to help customers achieve their business goals and gain competitive advantage.\nAt HPE Discover, we announced we have entered the AI public cloud market with HPE GreenLake for large language models. Available at the end of this calendar year, the offering will enable a wide variety of enterprise customers to privately train and tune their data, using our industry-leading AI sustainable supercomputer infrastructure and software. We also extended our hybrid cloud leadership at HPE Discover with new HP GreenLake hybrid cloud services, including our new SaaS-based IT operations management solution from a recent acquisition of OpsRamp. And to drive faster and easier and more sustainable ways to deploy our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud solutions outside of the data center, we expanded our partnership with Color market leader, which enables customers to go from quarter production in days by using our HPE GreenLake for Fibre Cloud Enterprise stack.\n2 new HP GreenLake for private cloud enterprise customers, our Global Logistics Solutions leader, Swisslog and global media -- global company media House. SwissLog chose HPE for private cloud enterprise to help accelerate their automation of its warehouse centers with a cutting-edge on-premises private cloud that could provide rapid, secure and controlled service delivery. Media House, which owns more than 30 different news brands in Europe, 1 in a modern on-premise private cloud to accelerate its digital transformation and better leverage data to attract and retain subscribers with a more personalized customer experience.\nHPE GreenLake will help the company achieve operational agility, mitigate risk and address IT skills gap and advance its digital priorities.\nAt HPE Discover, we expanded our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for private cloud business addition, a new offering that allows customers to spin a virtual machine across hybrid clouds on demand. This new offer is an extension of a hyperconverged portfolio with automation and hybrid cloud software built into the private cloud solution.\nEarly in the quarter, we previewed a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake platform alongside a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with the hybrid IT estate. Customers understand that the hybrid IT estate can be 1 of their biggest sources of operational emissions and have made measuring and reducing their carbon footprint business imperative.\nDriving the steady drumbeat of innovation strengthened our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud value proposition for customers to extend our industry leadership, expand our total addressable market and position us well to accelerate our momentum across edge, hybrid cloud and AI in the future. We have been advancing our strategy for the last several years and even a very dynamic market environment, it is clear that our strategy, combined with strong execution and a terrific team set us apart.\nOur third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas that they are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software and services rich businesses has led to new customer logos, greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. This is why we are once again raising our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance.\nDespite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders.\nI'm very pleased to pursue these priorities more closely with Jeremy Cox, whom I appointed as our interim Chief Financial Officer earlier this month. Jeremy is an experienced finance leader whose customer-centric approach, institutional knowledge and track record of operational excellence, sets him up well to serve in this role while we conduct an internal and external search for a permanent CFO. Jeremy will now discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. So Jeremy, welcome. Over to you.\n\nJeremy K. Cox\n\nSenior VP, Controller, Chief Tax Officer, Principal Account Officer & Interim CFO\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. I'm honored to take on the responsibility of interim CFO as we go through the process. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of FY 2023.\nAntonio discussed key highlights on Slide 4. Let me begin with Slide 5, financial highlights. We're actively diversifying our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and HPE GreenLake solutions. This pivot is clearly visible in the 120 basis-point year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP gross margins. We delivered a solid quarter within an IT market still under some pressure. Cycle times remain elongated, and digestion of prior orders will continue to have some near-term impact. This has been particularly true in Compute and to a lesser extent, in Storage.\nDespite these challenges, we delivered 3.5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance. This figure included a modest amount of AI revenue. We do see several promising indicators that suggest stabilization. Antonio mentioned the sequential improvement in demand across our 4 product segments. We're starting to see indicators that our largest customers are returning to the market. Intelligent Edge continues to increase revenues rapidly, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, and robust AI demand is evident in our as-a-service orders.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%. This is off just 30 basis points from our high watermark of 36.2% last quarter. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher margin, software-intensive recurring revenue, such as Intelligent Edge. The edge mix was up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 '23 non-GAAP operating margin reached 10.3%. This is down 120 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the driver was largely return of Compute operating margins to just below long-term target range of 11% to 13% after 6 consecutive quarters above the range.\nWe expect the impact of Compute operating margin cyclicality on HPE's operating margins to decline over time as our revenue mix shifts towards our higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Our Intelligent Edge business reached a record-high 29.7% operating margin. We remain focused on productivity and continue to expect revenue growth to outpace OpEx growth over time. Our solid Q3 and margin -- revenue and margin performance led GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49, which was up $0.01 year-over-year despite Compute cyclicality. It was also $0.01 above the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $0.44 to $0.48.\nOur Q3 free cash flow was $955 million. We continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders, paying $154 million in dividends and repurchasing $187 million in stock this quarter. We have now returned $831 million in capital to shareholders this year.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our as-a-service revenue continues to show strong momentum. ARR reached $1.3 billion in Q3 '23. The benefits of as-a-service deals we won in prior quarters are now appearing in our results, though, the large AI as-a-service deals booked in Q3 have yet to reach revenues. Year-over-year ARR growth in constant currency has accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31%, 38% and now 48% in Q3 '23. The 48% growth is above our long-term 35% to 45% target and should be viewed as an indicator of our long-term momentum rather than as a new growth trajectory.\nThe fastest-growing components within ARR year-over-year are Storage and Edge. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Antonio mentioned that in Q3, our software and services mix rose to 68% and should continue to increase. While this mix has traditionally tilted to services, software is now half of the total. In the future, we expect software growth to exceed services growth and for as-a-service margins to rise over time.\nTo Slide 7. Our Q3 as-a-service order growth was robust. We're pleased to have delivered 122% year-over-year order growth, which has raised our cumulative as-a-service TCV to nearly $12 billion. The driving factor was AI demand. A significant percentage of our AI orders have come under the as-a-service model, and the strength this quarter should also provide confidence in our long-term 35% to 45% ARR growth outlook. Order growth will fluctuate given the volatility of large as-a-service deals.\nNow let's turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. And remember, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenues 53% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, delivering record revenues for a fifth consecutive quarter. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We've expanded the access security and SASE funnel to 6x since the acquisition. Our operating margin of 29.7% was up more than 1,300 basis points year-over-year and 280 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from revenue scale and prior pricing actions, which are helping us build visibility into the durability of our mid-20% margin target over time. While we're making progress on our order book, we expect to carry an above-normal order book into FY '24.\nIn HPC & AI, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Customer discussions on large language models and generative AI that began in Q1 turned to wins in Q2 and are now showing up as as-a-service orders in Q3. AI, the predominant driver of our 122% year-over-year growth in as-a-service dollars has also driven sequential growth in our corporate total order book, which I'll discuss in a moment. We expect AI deals to provide gross margin rates above historical levels. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our HPE Cray supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable.\nAs for operating margin, our Q3 performance was just below breakeven. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and long lead times in this segment mean that operating margins in HPC & AI will continue to fluctuate. We'll discuss our outlook for revenue growth, investment and margin improvement at our Securities Analyst Meeting.\nStorage fell 2% year-over-year but rose 3% sequentially. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q3 for the fifth consecutive quarter. It is now 1 of our higher revenue products and thus growth rates may normalize. This product is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin, software-intensive revenue and is a key driver of our ARR growth. We'll continue to invest in R&D and our owned IP products in this business unit such as our new file as a Service and HPE Alletra MP offerings. Q3 23 operating margin of 10.7% is down 360 basis points year-over-year as we transition to HPE Alletra.\nHP Alletra includes a meaningful component of ratable revenue, which pushes revenue recognition out into future periods.\nCompute revenue was down 10% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and down 5% sequentially. The deal elongation challenges we've discussed previously were most prevalent in the Compute business as some customers digest prior investments. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a significant driver. But as previously noted, we did see sequential demand improvement. And after 6 quarters of above plan operating margins in Compute, this quarter's 10.9% was a shade below our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%.\nHPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 6% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 340 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest hikes and higher cost of funds that will gradually offset over time through pricing, as well as lower asset management margins as supply challenges ease. Time and time again, HPEFS has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality underwriting of our book of business.\nThroughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%, and our Q3 loss ratio of 0.48% was even lower than it was in the full year 2019 pre-pandemic.\nSlide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. The progress we're making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We've held our revenue steady this quarter and expanded non-GAAP diluted net EPS year-over-year despite an uneven spending environment, our transition towards a recurring revenue model and FX rates remaining a significant headwind. FX was a 280 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q3.\nOn Slide 10, we've included a new depiction of our portfolio shift, which illustrates just how significant the Intelligent Edge business has become for HPE. Even 3 years ago, Intelligent Edge constituted just 10% of revenue, and this quarter, it represents 20%. Operating profit trajectory is even more dramatic. Edge contributed just over 10% of operating profit 3 years ago and is now 49% of total segment operating profit. We will offer our forward-looking view at our Security Analyst Meeting.\nSlide 11 illustrates the progress we've made on our gross margin structure. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is up 120 basis points year-over-year despite FX headwinds. Our year-over-year non-GAAP gross profit and margin growth show the success of our strategic portfolio pivot and the pricing actions HPE has taken.\nSlide 12 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 10.3% in Q3. This is down 20 basis points year-over-year, also inclusive of FX headwinds and 120 basis points sequentially. While the primary driver of the sequential decline was the return of Compute operating margins to near our target range, we also made certain targeted investments in the quarter to further enable our pivot. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies and productivity focus put us on track to increase operating margin in FY '23.\nOn Slide 13, as previously announced, we exercised the put option on our shares in H3C and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% H3C stake at USD 3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to conclude certain conditions necessary for closing. We expect to conclude this process in the first half of calendar year 2024 and although this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined returns-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that we've outlined in the past.\nFinally, we continue to benefit from H3C dividends in FY '23. We'll offer an update on our go-forward expectations for H3C dividend at SAM in October.\nNow to Slide 14. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations and $955 million in free cash flow. Our Q3 free cash flow improved by approximately $670 million sequentially and nearly $370 million year-over-year. Similar to our Q4 '22 performance, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of FY '23 and are reiterating our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow in FY '23.\nThe timing of receipts and payments plus inventory investments have held cash conversion cycle steady sequentially at 23 days. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle.\nNow let's turn to outlook on Slide 15. As we've mentioned, the broader IT market is still pressured. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in others, such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive share gains in key markets. We are also entering Q4 with an order book that is more than 2x pre-pandemic levels. Our order book has increased from more than 1.5x prepandemic levels entering Q3, primarily on the strength of AI orders.\nThe assumptions in our guidance, which incorporate our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, demand, inflationary pressure, supply and FX rates remain relatively unchanged. We've indicated throughout the fiscal year that our financial performance is likely to be weighted to the first half of the year. We continue to view this as the proper framework for FY '23. For Q4, we expect revenues in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.48 and $0.52.\nWe're reiterating our prior fiscal year 2023 guidance of 4% to 6% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect FX to be a 300 basis-point revenue headwind from our previously communicated 250 to 300 basis-point headwind. In parallel, we also reiterate our expectation that margin strength from our portfolio mix shift will deliver non-GAAP operating growth of 6% to 7%. We're reiterating our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of between $1.42 and $1.46 due to tax rate differences and additional amortization of intangibles from our recent acquisitions.\nWe're raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from between $2.06 to $2.14 to between $2.11 and $2.15. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. For OI&E, we benefited this year from higher interest income and FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of these and other anticipated benefits in the second half of this fiscal year leads us to expect OI&E to be a positive $50 million to $70 million on a full year basis. We had previously expected OI&E to be neutral for the full year.\nIn terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividend and expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases.\nSo to conclude, the uneven end market demand thus far in FY '23 is an opportunity for HPE to showcase our differentiated portfolio led by HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge and HPC & AI and we'll continue to take the steps required to further accelerate the pivot of our product portfolio and our company towards faster growth, higher margin recurring revenues. We look forward to updating you with HPE's outlook beyond FY '23 at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October.\nNow let's open it up for questions.",

Finally, after Antonio provides his high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. With that, let me turn it over to you, Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nWell, thanks, Kirt, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. In the second quarter, HPE increased total revenues, drove larger contributions from recurring revenues and expanded overall profitability. I attribute this case to 2 primary factors: first, our strategy to build our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas is working; and second, we are operating with strong discipline. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we grew our revenue 9% year-over-year to $7 billion. Our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 38% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We grew year-over-year revenue across our key segments, except in compute, with our Intelligent Edge and High-Performance Computing and AI segments delivering particularly standout growth even though the potential in our HPC and AI segment was somewhat impacted by customer acceptance of certain large deals.\nHPE achieved exceptional profitability in the second quarter, increasing our non-GAAP gross margins a full 200 basis points to 36.2%, a new record. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift strategy supported by our operating discipline helped us generate a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose 18% year-over-year to $0.52, at the high end of our second quarter outlook. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was nearly $290 million, an increase of about $500 million from the prior year.\nAs a result of our second quarter performance and our expectations of profitability will increase this fiscal year, we are raising our full year GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Tarek will share further details about our full year updated guidance, including operating profit expectations later in our call.\nOur portfolio diversification is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data-first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge in hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the second quarter, we saw some decline in the health of macroeconomic conditions, causing unevenness in customer demand, particularly in general purpose compute.\nWe also see unevenness when comparing customer size, industry or geography. European, Asian and midsized company deals are holding up better than expected, while large enterprise businesses and customers in certain sectors such as financial services and manufacturing in North America have been more conservative with their spend. In the last few months, sales cycles have elongated because customers are more reluctant to quickly commit to large projects or some who seek additional internal approvals at the time of the order. We continue to focus on our sale processes to accelerate closing deals wherever possible.\nOur order book at the end of Q2 remains elevated at more than 1.5x the size of normalized historical levels. In the area of high-growth, Intelligent Edge, HPC and AI and the HPE GreenLake business, order books are especially large. Before I provide some business highlights, I want to be sure you saw the announcement we made last Friday related to our relationship with H3C Technologies. After successfully closing negotiations, we announced that UNIS will purchase all our shares in H3C for $3.5 billion in cash, subject to certain required regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Importantly, from the China market perspective, we are pleased that we have agreed to the terms of a new go-forward commercial agreement that we will enter with H3C. Tarek will share more in his remarks.\nOur HPE GreenLake platform continues to power the growth of our software infrastructure and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time this quarter. HPE GreenLake also drove our ARR to $1.1 billion in the second quarter with an increasing portion coming from margin-rich software and services, which now is 66% of our total ARR mix. Our other service business continued to expand our opportunities pipeline, though orders this quarter dipped slightly 8% year-over-year. This was driven by a very tough comparison to fiscal year Q2 2022 when orders more than doubled.\nWe have had a great ramp with our HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise offering, which advances customers' hybrid cloud environments with a consistent intuitive cloud operating experience. Global engineering company, Danfoss, selected HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise as a part of an effort to transform its global IT strategy. With HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, the company moved its IT to an agile sprint-based environment that aligns the right workload on the right platform, always while significantly reducing its carbon footprint.\nWe continue to innovate the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. To complement our organic innovation earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, a hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. We are already getting very positive feedback from customers and partners. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into HPE GreenLake in Q3, we enter a $39 billion IT operations management market.\nHPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio, and we are seeing this value across our business segments. Let me provide a few segment highlights. Intelligent Edge had a standout quarter. HPE Aruba Networking has exceeded our expectations in revenue and margin terms, in part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently deliver infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment and the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.\nWe continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud security provider, Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE secure access service edge offering. And with a soon-to-close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet and a world-class HPE Aruba Networking Intelligent Edge capabilities gives HP one of the most comprehensive connected edge portfolios in the market. We expect this business to continue to grow in the quarters ahead.\nIn our HPC & AI business, we saw a significant sequential increase in orders this quarter, with a noteworthy uptick across customer segments from Fortune 500 companies, including a large cloud provider to digital native start-ups looking for optimized AI supercomputing solutions. HPE is winning in AI because we deliver an end-to-end portfolio designed for the full spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases, spanning large-scale model development, training and inferencing. Customers are attracted to HPE's market-leading supercomputing capabilities, differentiated interconnect IP, AI-specific software and services expertise.\nSince the start of the second quarter, we have won multiple large contracts totaling more than $800 million from large cloud providers and enterprise customers that will develop, train and run AI models. Most of these contracts exceed $100 million each. We expect this pipeline to continue to grow and anticipate these deals will generate significant revenue in later quarters. For example, in Q2, HPE won an AI-focused deal with Crusoe Energy, a cloud provider pioneering infrastructure that taps stranded energy like wasted methane or tractor renewable energy to power compute resources. Using HPE Cray supercomputers as a generative AI foundation, Crusoe will enable customers to train and run, scale AI models in a sustainable way. Crusoe's mission is to align the future of computing with the future of the climate, and this deal enables a significant offering of a climate-aligned supercomputer service solution.\nJust last week, the Top 500 Supercomputer List was released and HPE Systems comprise more than 1/3 of the top 100 most powerful systems in the world, included Frontier in the #1 spot. In this latest evaluation, the performance of Frontier, the world's first exascale health supercomputer jumped by another 8%. In the quarter, we recognized a portion of the total revenue of our second exascale system called Aurora for Argonne National Laboratory. Aurora will develop a series of generative AI models to run on the HPE Cray EX Supercomputer, which includes HPE Slingshot, a proven Ethernet interconnect that can scale to the system's more than 60,000 GPUs and more than 21,000 CPUs.\nAurora is expected to deliver more than 2 exaflops of peak performance computing. Argonne plans to open the generative AI models to scientific community for a range of research, including an initial focus on accelerating drug discovery and cancer research. AI is a significant profitable growth opportunity for HPE and our shareholders in a space where HPE has unique differentiation, evidenced in the momentum of our business. In just a few weeks, we will host our annual customer event, HPE Discover, where we'll make breakthrough announcements in HPE GreenLake, hybrid cloud and AI solutions that we anticipate will accelerate the demand for our differentiated portfolio. We hope many of you will join us in Las Vegas to see our strategy and diverse offerings come to life\nIn our Storage segment, our pivot to IP-owned products continue to get traction in the market, shown by the impressive ramp of HPE Alletra offerings. HPE Alletra revenue increased more than 100% year-over-year. In April, we announced new storage services, HPE GreenLake for Block Storage and HPE GreenLake for File Storage. The new services leverage HPE Alletra Storage, a simplified data life cycle management with an intuitive cloud operations to store, manage and protect customers' data wherever it resides.\nIn the month between launch and the close of the quarter, customer orders for the solutions were strong. For example, the Dallas selected HPE GreenLake for Block Storage because they believe the simple management, efficient scale and high performance delivered by a new solution will add even more value to their IT operations and customer experience.\nIn Compute, our continued focus on pricing discipline has added to the segment profit contribution. We continue to see some sluggishness from large accounts, many of which have placed large orders with industry supply more constrained. As we look ahead, we are focused on unit growth in other segments of the market. We are executing our strategy and delivering strong results, including year-over-year revenue growth, record gross margin and expanded earnings.\nHPE's year-over-year revenue growth, earnings per share expansion and consistent increase in ARR contribution over the last 2-plus years demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and shift in our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas, rich in software and services. Our strong operational discipline continues to drive operating leverage across the company. I'm personally proud of the 60,000 team members for its commitment to both think and innovation is helping our customers achieve their goals.\nOur customers are counting on HPE as a key partner to help them capture opportunities ahead from the edge to hybrid cloud to AI. While the macroeconomic environment may introduce more uncertainty in the short term, I am confident that our winning strategy, diverse portfolio and continued innovation position us well to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I now would like Tarek to provide business segment details and specifics about our progress. So Tarek, over to you.\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nChief Financial Officer, Sprint Corp.\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '23. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q2 '23 on Slide 4. Let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 5.\nI would characterize this quarter as solid overall despite the uneven demand indicators across our portfolio, particularly in Compute, with continued demand and outstanding performance in our Intelligent Edge business as a standout. We are very pleased that we are successfully driving further diversification of our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and HPE GreenLake solutions. During the quarter, net revenues grew 56% year-over-year in Edge, 22% year-over-year in HPC & AI and the HPE GreenLake ARR grew 38% year-over-year, all in constant currency.\nThe pivot of our portfolio towards higher-growth, higher-margin markets is clearly visible in the expansion of gross margins and our strategy is working. While we remain confident about our fiscal year '23 and beyond, we are also realistic. Demand through much of the past 2 years has been above trend as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year '20 to '22 period throughout our business, including Compute, which is very cyclical in nature. Demand shifted from fiscal year '22 and to uneven in Q1 and was even more uneven in Q2 across our portfolio. While Q2 revenue of $7 billion equates to a healthy 4% year-over-year growth and 9% year-over-year growth in constant currency, revenues were below our prior guidance range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion.\nDeal velocity has slowed, particularly in North America and in Compute and, to a lesser extent, in Storage. Deal cycles have elongated as customers primarily are larger compute customers digest their investments over the past 2 years. This trend has been particularly pronounced for compute in the manufacturing and financial services verticals in North America, in part as a result of the loss of confidence in the banking sector. In addition, HPC & AI was affected by several customer acceptances that slipped out of Q2.\nDespite this, we see several promising indicators. Demand in Q2 grew sequentially, led by HPC & AI and our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba. Aruba continues to grow revenues, both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Overall demand in Compute in the mid-market is stable, including direct enterprise and the channel. Our overall order book at the start of Q3 remains elevated at more than 1.5x normalized historical levels, and we expect a strong momentum in Intelligent Edge to continue. And finally, AI demand is very solid, as you heard from Antonio, and materializing in our pipeline and our order book with several very large deals. More on that later.\nWe also continue to take action to strengthen the portfolio mix shift inorganically across our businesses. We have closed the acquisitions of Axis Security and OpsRamp and are already winning deals with these assets as part of a broader HPE. I am particularly proud that we have finalized an agreement with our partners at UNIS for the sale of our 49% stake through the exercise of our put option for an amount of $3.5 billion. More on that later.\nIn recognition of the Compute weakness, we are adjusting our previously communicated guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency. Nevertheless, the combination of our order book, ongoing strength and momentum in Edge and HPC & AI gives us confidence that we will deliver solid FY '23 revenue growth and remain confident in the 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the FY '22 to FY '25 period that we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in October.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin reached a high watermark of 36.2%. This is up 200 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher-margin and software-intensive recurring revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba was 19% of total revenue in Q2, up 580 basis points year-over-year. And with Q2 sequential revenue growth in Aruba at 15%, we expect Aruba to represent a larger portion of the company's gross and operating profits by the end of fiscal year '23. As a result, our Q2 '23 non-GAAP operating margin reached 11.5%. This is 220 basis points ahead of Q2 '22 and down just 30 basis points from a record performance in Q1 '23.\nIn addition to the portfolio mix shift towards high-margin businesses, we remain focused on cost control and productivity. Antonio and I remain determined to maintain this focus and to grow revenues faster than OpEx over time. Our Q2 margin strength drove GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, at the high end of our guidance range of $0.44 to $0.52. Q2 '23 free cash flow was positive $288 million, an improvement of nearly $500 million over Q2 '22 and $1.6 billion over Q1 '23. We will discuss cash flow in more details later. Having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year.\nFinally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million in stock this quarter and are on track to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23. Our year-to-date total capital returns are [ $409 million ], which reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation.\nMoving to Slide 6. We are very pleased to announce our pivot to as-a-service revenue continues to show strong momentum as ARR surpassed $1.1 billion in Q2 '23. The benefits of easing supply challenges are appearing in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31% in Q1 '23 and now 38% in Q2 '23. Our edge and storage SaaS offerings are the fastest growth components of our as-a-service portfolio.\nOur as-a-service order decline of 8% in Q2 '23 is a function of a tough compare to Q2 '22, in which orders grew 107% on strength of several large deals. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline, which includes very large enterprise AI wins we recently closed and reiterate our 3-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q2 '23, our mix of software and services increased another 220 basis points year-over-year to 66%. And we have attained a total TCV well in excess of $10 billion.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we grew our revenue 56% year-over-year and exceeded the Rule of 40 for a second consecutive quarter. Most importantly, we grew revenues 15% sequentially and delivered record revenues for a fourth consecutive quarter. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share in some of the largest enterprise customers who are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform.\nWe have now closed our acquisition of Axis Security and are already generating SD-WAN and SASE wins in combination. Our acquisition of private 5G player Athonet is still pending but already contributing to our pipeline of business. Our operating margin of 26.9% was up more than 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and a solid order book that continues to grow. And as a result, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Intelligent Edge business in fiscal year '23 and beyond.\nIn HPC AI, revenue grew 22% year-over-year. The emergence of large language models and generative AI has prompted many inquiries from our customer base during the past quarter, which are turning into pipeline and orders. In the past few months, we have multiple large enterprise AI wins totaling more than $800 million and counting. This includes large AI-as-a-service deals under the GreenLake model. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our great supercomputers and HPC AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We expect the AI demand to drive healthy revenue growth in the future and intend to invest organically and inorganically to fully grasp this opportunity as our acquisitions of Determined AI and Pachyderm attest. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and non-linked times in this business means that operating margins in the business unit will continue to fluctuate.\nStorage revenue grew 2% year-over-year. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q2 for the fourth consecutive quarter, lifting our total all-flash array growth to 20% year-over-year. HPE Alletra is driving a long-term mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service revenue. We will continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit such as our new file-as-a-service and Alletra MP offerings. Our Q2 '23 operating margin of 7.9% is down 390 basis points year-over-year as we navigate uneven demand and migrate to our software-defined HPE Alletra, which includes a significant component of SaaS ratable revenue.\nCompute revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion and down 20% sequentially. The [indiscernible] and demand softness I discussed previously was most prevalent in the Compute business as our large customers, particularly in manufacturing and financial services in North America, digest the investments they have made in recent years. Our Compute operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the sixth consecutive quarter, which attests to the quality of our historical book of business. While we are seeing decreasing commodities costs leading to increased competitive price pressure, we are selling 3 differentiated platforms in the market, Gen10, Gen10+ and Gen11, which should allow a gradual management of margins over time.\nIn HPE Services, which is within our Compute, HPC AI and Storage segments and excluding HPE GreenLake, orders were down low single digits and revenues were flat year-over-year. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 17% in constant currency driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 280 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest rate hikes and higher cost of funds that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, this business has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality of the underlying of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our Q2 loss ratio of 50 basis points was below full year 2019 or pre-pandemic levels.\nSlide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased with the progress we are making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have again grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS in Q2 '23 year-over-year despite our transition towards a recurring revenue model, an uneven spending environment and FX rates remaining a significant headwind that impacted revenue growth by 480 basis points in Q2 '23.\nSlide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q2 '23 non-GAAP gross margin is up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of the strategic pivot of our portfolio and the pricing actions we have taken. With 56% year-over-year growth in constant currency, our Intelligent Edge business was a standout and is now representing 19% of total sales in Q2 '23, up 580 basis points from a year ago.\nSlide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin progress, which reached 11.5% in Q2 '23. This is up 220 basis points year-over-year, and it also represents a high watermark for non-GAAP operating profit margin for a Q2 in any year. Again, our portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies and productivity focus are the primary drivers of our operating margin expansion. The Intelligent Edge business not only represented 19% of revenue in the quarter but did so with a record 26.9% operating margin.\nTurning to the next slide. As you know, we have chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We are pleased to have announced earlier that we and our partner, Unisplendour, have come to an agreement and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% stake in H3C at USD 3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to complete certain conditions necessary for closing. We anticipate that the process to close will require a further 6 to 12 months to complete. However, this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement.\nWe intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined return-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating we have outlined in the past. As part of this framework, we may consider a range of allocation activities, including but not limited to, both organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt and general corporate purposes.\nWe have also negotiated the terms of a new go-forward strategic sale agreement to be entered into with H3C that covers the commercial sales, service and reseller arrangements between the companies. We're firmly committed to serving our customers and to continuing to do business in China through both direct sales and our partner, H3C. Finally, as you see on this slide, we are continuing to benefit from H3C dividends in fiscal year '23 and we'll provide a more detailed update at SAM in October 23 as to our go-forward expectations in this area.\nIn Q2 '23, we are pleased to have generated a positive $889 million in cash flow from operations and $288 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.6 billion sequentially from a seasonally low Q1 '23 and was also nearly $500 million above our Q2 '22 free cash flow. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year '23 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.\nNet income was the primary driver of our positive free cash flow. Working capital continued to be a use of cash in the quarter. The timing of receipts and payments plus continuing inventory investments have lifted our cash conversion cycle to a positive 24 days in Q2 '23. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Also, please remember we have made significant CapEx investments in HPFS volumes to drive future revenue growth in subsequent quarters.\nNow let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q2 '23 across our business than it was in Q1 '23. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in other end markets such as Edge and HPC AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains in key markets. We're also entering Q3 '23 still carrying a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure and FX risk, which is -- which represented a 480 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q2 '23.\nI would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year '23 is likely to be more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. We continue to view that as the proper lens for fiscal year '23. For Q3 '23, we expect revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents revenues that are stable year-over-year and most importantly, flat sequentially in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.34 to $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.48. This outlook assumes the current levels of demand we have been experiencing remain relatively unchanged, that we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book and no further deterioration from FX rates.\nGiven the weakness in Compute demand, we are adjusting our previously communicated fiscal year '23 guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency and expect FX to be a 250 to 300 basis point revenue headwind. In parallel, we also expect our margin strength from portfolio mix shift to deliver non-GAAP operating profit growth of 6% to 7%, which is up from our prior 5% to 6% view. We are lifting our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $1.40 to $1.48 to a new range of $1.42 to $1.50 and raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $2.02 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.06 to $2.14.\nWe reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. For I&E, we have benefited in the first half '23 from FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of this plus other anticipated benefits in the second half of '23 now leads us to expect to why I need to be neutral on a full year basis versus our prior expectation of a $20 million to $40 million expense. In terms of capital returns, we expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And we are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23.\nSo to conclude, we see the uneven end market demand in FY '23 as an opportunity for HPE to accelerate our portfolio pivot to faster growth, higher-margin recurring revenues. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year '23 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.",

Finally, after Antonio provides high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks.\nAnd with that, let me turn it to you, Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nWell, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call. We began our fiscal year 2023 from a position of great strength after delivering an outstanding 2022 fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with how we leveraged that strength to achieve impressive results in Q1. HPE posted a record set in first quarter performance, extending our track record of consistency fulfilling our financial commitments. We generated our highest first quarter revenue since 2016 and our best ever non-GAAP operating profit margin.\nOur focus on growth opportunities and pricing discipline produced our highest ever non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Powered by our market-leading hybrid cloud platform, HPE GreenLake, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate or ARR for the first time. Our results show the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI reshaping our industry, the transformation of our industry-leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team.\nIn the first quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 18% to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook. We once again expanded non-GAAP operating margin this time to a record 11.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63. Free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, reflecting working capital needs in a quarter where we typically see use of cash.\nOur Q1 performance and the size of our order book position us well for fiscal year 2023. Our quarterly results, combined with confidence in our strategy and execution have led us to raise our revenue and EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. Tarek will provide more details in his remarks.\nFrom a macro perspective, the supply chain challenges we faced during several quarters continue to ease, and we expect more of that throughout fiscal year 2023. As we mentioned at the close of fiscal year 2022, we do not anticipate all supply shortages coming to an end, but we do expect supply availability to continue to improve. Our order book at the start of Q1 was larger than it was a year ago.\nAnd as we exit that quarter, it is more than twice the size of normalized historical levels. Our Intelligent Edge, HPC and AI and other as-a-service order books continue to stand at extremely elevated level. Against today's macroeconomic backdrop, demand for our solutions continue. Though it is uneven across our portfolio, we also see more innovated sales cycles, specifically in compute that we have seen in recent quarters.\nWe responded decisively to demand in the market working to win deals across all geographies and all parts of our portfolio. The traction of our portfolio is the result of our winning strategy, aligned to major market trends around the edge, cloud and AI. We continue to anticipate what comes next for our customers and invest in innovation to address the data first modernization needs with an unmatched set of Edge-to-Cloud solutions.\nIn addition to driving impressive organic innovation across our portfolio, we continue to be opportunistic in considering strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance what we can offer to our customers. Today, we announced our agreement to acquire cloud security provider Axis Security, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge or SaaS solutions, as we anticipate further customer demand for enhanced connectivity to our HPE Aruba Intelligent Edge solutions.\nLast week, we also announced our purchase of Athonet, which strengthened our private networking capabilities to help enterprises and telcos accelerate 5G deployments. Through these acquisitions, we are creating 1 of the most complete cloud portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity; areas we have identified for growth in coming years. These new private 5G capabilities will be integrated into our HPE GreenLake platform, enabling customers to combine their WiFi and private 5G into 1 subscription that can scale according to demand.\nEarlier in the first quarter, we also purchased technology from 2 companies that enhance our cloud computing and AI offerings. Next quarter, we will begin selling scalable compute software technologies from [hyperscale], introducing additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive workloads needs. We also integrate -- we will also integrate the Pachyderm reproducible AI software with our supercomputing AI solutions to further expand our AI at scale capabilities. We will continue to assess organic and inorganic investments that improve our competitive position in growth markets while driving higher level of recurring revenue and profitability.\nAs always, we follow a disciplined return-based framework to build on our track record of creating sustainable long-term value for shareholders. Since we began the transformation of our business in 2019 to become the Edge-to-Cloud company, we have consistently grown our other service business, underpinned by the HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both [AIR] and our as-a-service total contract value higher. Over the last 2 years, we have more than doubled our as-a-service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter.\nThese milestones prove the momentum in our transformation. During the first quarter, we once again increased our new HPE Green logos, growing our customer base by 7%. While as-a-service order this quarter declined 20% year-over-year, it is important to keep in mind that the order figure is compared to prior year growth of a record 136%. One HPE GreenLake customer we recently highlighted is the 2023 Ryder Cup, which announced HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and flexible high-performance network to our platform at the September 2023 golf event in Rome.\nOur platform will enable the Ryder Cup to deliver the tournament as-a-service in a sustainable cost-efficient way while significantly enhancing the spectator experience and engagement. We have continued our investment in HP GreenLake, expanding our cloud services portfolio and partner ecosystem. In December, at our HPE Discover Frankfurt customer event in Germany, we announced our latest enhancements and the new cloud platform services capabilities in the data analytics, developer and sustainability areas. Our HPE GreenLake platform continue to attract business and drive performance across the portfolio. In every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit.\nLet me provide you a few highlights. In our Intelligent Edge segment, revenue increased 31% year-over-year. We continue to see customers switch to our HPE Aruba technology from other vendors. We provide a single AI-driven cloud management experience, which is now part of HPE GreenLake platform with ease of use and proven cost benefits. Year-over-year revenue growth was even higher in our HPC & AI segment, up 37% as we book revenue associated with Frontier, the world's first exascale system. HPE is the clear market leader and has significant growth opportunities as enterprises scale AI models.\nAI will transform the IT landscape in the coming years and is a generation of technology shift like web, mobile and cloud that have the potential to disrupt existing business models. Supercomputing will be essential to enabling this disruption. For example, building a viable generative large language model for search would require a supercomputer to run the model continuously to stay current and improve accuracy. Our HPC & AI business has strong IP in the case of experience that give HPE a competitive advantage in building large computing systems, which are required to increase social adoption of AI models globally.\nWe recognize AI will become the dominant supercomputing workload, while we acquired the market leader Cray in 2019, and continue to invest in key technology innovations that will enable these AI models at scale. Key examples are our acquisition of Determined AI in 2021 and Pachyderm early this year while adding unique and differentiated software to help our customer train AI models and automate data pipelines. Customers recognized this leadership. For example, Aleph Alfa, a German startup building a commercial large language model has turned to HPE. We're also working with customers across industry verticals such as life sciences, aerospace to enable new breakthroughs with AI.\nIn the quarters ahead, we anticipate sharing more news on how we are scaling in this market and attracting new customers. I'm also pleased with the strong and steady performance of HPE Financial Services, which grew revenue 8% and financing volumes 21% year-over-year. Last month, we announced the retirement of our long-standing leader of this business, Irv Rothman, and the promotion of Gerri Gold to take the helm and further accelerate the business momentum. Gerri and her team recently launched a special financing program for customers who score high in ESG, and we are seeing great customer and partner response already.\nI am very proud of how the HP team members have executed to achieve this quarter's exceptional performance, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal year 2023 with another set of standout results, giving us the confidence to raise our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. Our customers have responded to the hybrid cloud value proposition we uniquely provide as they seek better ways to drive value from data from Edge-to-Cloud. We are attracting more customers and executing with discipline. As we look forward, we remain laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, which is delivering unmatched innovation and significant results for our customers and shareholders. We are confident in our strategy and execution for the long term.\nLet me now ask Tarek to give details on our business segments and greater visibility into our updated financial outlook. so Tarek, over to you.\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. Q1 '23 was, as Antonio said, a record quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides some earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q1 '23 on Slide 4. Let me discuss our Q1 performance details, starting with Slide 5. We are very pleased that the execution of our strategy has driven record quarterly results in terms of revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS for a first quarter of a financial year. These and other records I referenced are primarily since we reset our strategy with our 2017 spin-off transactions.\nNotably, revenues grew year-over-year across all our business segments, save for corporate in Q1 '23, as we benefited from improvements in the supply environment. Our supply chain execution is solid, we have very strong momentum, thanks to our substantial order book and our investments are bearing fruit, and we are gaining share in specific at segments. In short, our strategy is working and working really well. Having said so, while we are optimistic about our fiscal year '23, we're all realistic. Overall, we have experienced above-trend demand through much of the past 2 years as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year '20 to '22 period.\nAnd our market demand has shifted from being steady across our portfolio to being uneven over the course of Q1 '23. More specifically, deal velocity for Compute has slowed as customers digest the investments of the past 2 years, though demand for our storage and HPCI solutions is holding and demand for our edge solutions remains healthy. In that context, we are taking action to maintain our momentum for the second half of '23 and fiscal year '24. We intend to further our investments in software and services in all our business units including in our HPE GreenLake Edge Cloud platform, HPC AI, storage and edge to extend our share gains across our segments, all while retaining our cost discipline and productivity focus.\nWe delivered Q1 revenue of $7.8 billion, which equates to a robust 12% year-over-year growth and 18% in constant currency despite our exit from Russia and Belarus in Q2 '22. We did not experience a typical seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1, thanks to excellent supply chain execution on our large order book. Each of our segments excluding only our Corporate segment grew revenue at least 8% in constant currency. This revenue performance was well above our prior guidance for Q1 of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and represented a record Q1 revenue level.\nWe benefited from improvements in the supply environment, particularly in our Compute segment. This allowed us to execute against our order book, which our customers greatly appreciated. The delivery times of our products and services across our portfolio are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Yet we continue to have more progress to make in supply chain productivity as our order book entering Q2 '23 is more than twice normal level across our company. The combination of our large order book and improved supply environment gives us confidence that we can grow revenues well above the previously communicated guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency for fiscal year '23. More on that later.\nAs a result, we also a confidence in the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25 period, we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting last October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a Q1 record of 34.2%. This is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. Our margin structure has benefited from pricing actions we have taken over the course of the pandemic, combined with the beginnings of declines in commodities and logistics costs. Over the long term, our margin structure will continue to benefit as we continue to shift our mix of business to higher margin software-intensive as-a-service offerings.\nOur non-GAAP operating margins reached a record high 11.8%. This is 80 basis points ahead of Q1 '22 and 30 basis points higher than Q4 '22. While strong revenue growth and gross margin performance are key drivers, this result would not have been possible without the strategic actions, Antonio and I took in fiscal year '20 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. As mentioned during our last earnings call, Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity.\nOur top line and margin strength in Q1 translated to GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.63. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS easily exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.58 and was another company record. Our Q1 2023 free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion. We typically have seasonal outflows in our Q1. We will discuss cash flow in more detail in a moment. But having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year '23. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders.\nWe paid $156 million in dividend this quarter and repurchased $73 million in stock. We intend to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23, just like we did in fiscal year '22.\nTurning on to our as-a-Service business performance. We are very pleased to announce our ARR surpassed $1 billion in Q1 '23. This is an important milestone for our business that reflects that our as-a-service strategy is working. The supply chain challenges have slowed our ARR growth in prior quarters. The benefits of easing supply challenges are beginning to appear in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31% in Q1 '23.\nWe expect further acceleration through fiscal year '23 as improving supply allows us to expedite delivery of as-a-service solutions to our customers. Our as-a-service order decline of 20% in Q1 is a function of a difficult compare to Q1 '22, in which orders grew 136% on strength from several large deals, including a large public cloud customer. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline of as-a-Service business. We base this confidence on our 68% order growth in fiscal year '22, the number of deals currently pending acceptance and our current view of the sales funnel.\nWe, therefore, retain our 3-year ARR target of 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-Service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q1 '23, our mix of software and services increased another 150 basis points year-over-year to 65%, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in edge and storage.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter and surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone for the first time. We grew our revenue 31% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share with our combination of wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN solutions, including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as our edge service platform and automation suite.\nOur operating margin of 21.9% was up 450 basis points annually and 860 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and our prior price increases have worked through our order book. We are very, very pleased that our edge business has exceeded the Rule of 40 this quarter and feel very optimistic about the prospects of our Aruba business in fiscal year '23 and beyond, given its substantial order book underpinned by a superior platform-based SaaS offerings.\nWe retain confidence in our long-term targets of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margins. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 37% year-over-year. We successfully closed the balance of the Frontier deal in Q1, which contributed to the strength of this business in Q1 '23. While the segment is also now benefiting from easing supply chain, the lumpiness and long lead times of this business mean that operating margins will continue to fluctuate.\nAs Antonio mentioned, we have been thinking strategically about and investing behind artificial intelligence for many years. This is true both organically and inorganically. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and BART and generative AI, some of which run on our systems has prompted many questions from our customer base.\nWe believe AI at scale is a high-growth market and that the building and refinement of AI models will require unique computational capabilities that our Cray supercomputers and HPI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We intend to invest organically and inorganically as listed by our acquisition of Pachyderm to fully grasp this opportunity.\nWith regards to storage, we are pleased to report 10% annual growth, where we are bolstering our portfolio to grow market share. HPE Alletra remains 1 of our fastest-growing new product introductions ever, and grew well above triple digits in Q1.\nHPE Alletra contributed to double-digit growth in our own IP products, which is driving a mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as a service revenue. We continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit. And as a result, our Q1 operating margin of 12% is down 190 basis points year-over-year. Compute revenues grew 19% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steaming initiatives we have discussed in prior calls as well as steadily improving supply availability. Our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate the volatile supply climate while driving industry-leading gross margins.\nOur compute operating margin of 17.6% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the fifth consecutive quarter, which attests to our best-in-class performance. We do believe our compute operating margins are peaking and should gradually return to our target range of 11% to 13%. While we are seeing commodities costs decreasing, leading to increased competitive price pressure, we have for the first time 3 concurrent and differentiated platforms being sold in the market, Gen10, Gen10 Plus and Gen11, which would allow a gradual management of pricing and margins over time.\nIn our Pointnext Operational Services business, combined with storage services, orders declined mid- to high single digits and revenues were flat year-over-year, driven by uneven demand. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenues and profit for each of our segments. Finally, HPE Financial Services revenues rose 8% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.6 billion grew 21% in constant currency. Our operating margins fell 300 basis points year-over-year due to the higher interest rate climate that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, our HPFS business has proven resilience in downturn, thanks to the quality of the underwriting of the book of business.\nThroughout the pandemic, I'd like to remind you, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 50 basis points. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased that the progress we are making against our Edge-to-Cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to record or near-record levels in Q1 '23. This illustrates not only the commercial success of our products in the marketplace, but also our ability to generate healthy margins.\nI am particularly pleased to see that our focus on supply chain execution has enabled the attainment of record revenues despite a substantial year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates that impacted revenue growth by 550 basis points in Q1 '23. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q1 '23 non-GAAP gross margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We generated $2.7 billion in gross profit in Q1 '23, which is yet another quarterly record. Our gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the period of supply challenges in fiscal year '20 to fiscal year '22.\nIt is also illustrative of the long-term favorable mix shift we are driving. Despite a strong compute quarter, our revenue mix of Compute at 44% was flat year-over-year. This illustrates that we have a larger revenue base as our higher-margin segments are growing rapidly, and our as-a-service strategy is gaining momentum. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margins, which reached 11.8% in Q1 '23. This is up 30 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points year-over-year.\nIt is also a record quarterly non-GAAP operating margin for the company. Our very strong Q1 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are the leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. Unlike many tech companies that have announced layoffs recently, we have strong momentum in HPE with a combination of our improved cost structure, substantial order book and outstanding execution, delivering profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Again, let me reiterate that Antonio and I are determined to maintain this focus on profitable growth and productivity for the future.\nLet's now turn to discuss H3C. As you know, we've chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We took this decision after carefully weighing the financial implications of remaining in the joint venture with the risk-reward profile of exercising the put. We are confident that we have made the decision that is in the best interest of our shareholders. HPE and our partner, Unisplendour continue to have constructive discussions to reach agreement on the determination of the final purchase price of HPE shares in H3C and enter into a share purchase agreement. We will keep you updated. Please keep in mind that our decision to exercise the put is distinct from the commercial agreements with H3C. We intend to continue to do business in China through both our direct sales and through H3C, and we remain committed to serving our customers in China.\nI would like to remind you that we will continue to recognize the value of the dividends we received from H3C in our financials until the transaction is complete, and I'm happy to report H3C results remains healthy despite uncertainty in the Chinese economy. Our first fiscal year from a cash flow perspective is typically a down quarter for cash flow.\nIn Q1 '23, we had outflows of $800 million in cash flow from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Working capital was a use of cash due to timing of receipts, payments and continued investments in inventory, which has driven our cash flow conversion cycle from a negative 14 days in Q4 to a positive 15 days in Q1 '23. More specifically, our accounts payable balance was reduced by $2.2 billion quarter-over-quarter and was the main driver for negative operating cash flow and affected our cash flow conversion cycle.\nAlso, we have made significant investment in HPFS volumes to drive future growth in subsequent quarters. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year '23 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to our outlook slide on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q1 '23 across our business than it was in Q4 '22. Having said that, we also believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains and are entering Q2 '23 with a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. We had strong momentum in Q1 '23, and we are now turning our focus to invest in sustaining that momentum in the second half of '23 and fiscal year '24 in a context of continuous macroeconomic uncertainty.\nLet me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, our exit from Russia and Belarus in '22 and foreign exchange risk. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q2 '23, we expect revenues in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 9% year-over-year growth in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.27 to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. This outlook assumes the current level of demand we have been experiencing remain unchanged, and that we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book.\nTo sum it up, I am very pleased with our Q1 results and guidance for Q2. We also understand some of our end markets are likely to remain uneven in the near term. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in Fiscal year '23 is likely to be more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. Given the strong Q1 performance, momentum and substantial order book we continue to have, we are lifting our full year guidance accordingly.\nWe are now targeting 5% to 7% revenue growth adjusted for currency, which is at the midpoint, twice our prior revenue growth guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 5% to 6%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.02 to $2.10 and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.\nSpecifically for OI&E, we benefited in Q1 '23 from one-off foreign exchange gains that accounted for $0.02 to $0.03 per share. These are unlikely to repeat in the rest of the fiscal year. Given the high interest rate environment is expected to remain unchanged, we expect OI&E to be an expense of $20 million to $40 million on a full year basis. This explains our fiscal year '23 EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.10, which incorporates $0.06 of the $0.09 beat in Q1 '23.\nIn terms of capital returns, we will return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. We are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves, and we continue to execute better than the competition.\nWhile many tech companies are playing defense with layoffs, we see fiscal year '23 as an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our strategy. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year '23 and beyond.\nNow with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.",

My name is Chuck, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.\nI would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Kvaal, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJeffrey Thomas Kvaal\n\nSenior Director of IR, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you, Chuck. I'm Jeff Kvaal, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.\nElements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nFor a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

The earnings presentation is also embedded within the webcast player on our website for this earnings call.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to you, Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nWell, thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today.\nHP had an impressive fourth quarter, delivering outstanding performance across our key performance metrics. Q4 was HPE's most profitable quarter on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis since 2017, with our second highest quarterly revenue and record quarterly free cash flow.\nIn 2018, we introduced a clear strategy to deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders. And in 2019, we began our pivot to prioritize recurring revenue through our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. We have refocused our portfolio and our customer value proposition toward high growth and higher gross margin solutions.\nWe also improved our operating leverage across the company. We are now seeing these strategic actions paying off. In Q4, orders remained steady, showing continued interest in our differentiated Edge-to-Cloud solutions across industries, from enterprises large and small. Demand over the course of the year was enduring and proved to be better than we anticipated.\nWe closed this fiscal year with a significantly larger order book than we had at the start of the year. I am very proud of our performance in the quarter and in fiscal year 2022. Faced with ongoing macroeconomic challenges, supply constraints and adverse foreign exchange, HPE executed exceptionally well.\nDuring the fourth quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to almost $8 billion, which was above our sequential outlook as we started to see a slight improvement to ongoing supply constraints. Our Compute and Intelligent Edge businesses had particularly strong revenue growth, each rising more than 20%.\nEven on this higher revenue base, we grew our non-GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP operating margin rose to 11.5%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, one of the highest quarterly levels in HPE's history. Non-GAAP gross margin was just above 33%, a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year, reflecting ongoing pricing discipline.\nAs customers continue to turn to our edge-to-cloud solutions, we saw increased demand for our HP GreenLake platform. Annualized revenue run rate rose 25% year-over-year even with supply constraints as a headwind. Total as-a-service orders again increased more than 30% from a year ago, helping us close the fiscal year with as-a-service order growth of 68%.\nIn the final quarter of the fiscal year, as-a-service orders represented approximately 12% of the total company bookings. Non-GAAP profit in the quarter was a standout. We achieved record quarterly profit despite the continued unfavorable effects from foreign exchange.\nOur non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.57, a 90% sequential rise and 10% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow in the final quarter was just shy of $2 billion, our best ever for a quarter. Free cash flow improved in the second half of the fiscal year 2022 as expected, following better supply chain conversion and working capital actions as we took to increase cash flow from operations.\nAs we look at our full fiscal year '22 performance, it is clear the HP GreenLake platform has enhanced our financial profile with more resilient recurring revenue. Our portfolio is steadily becoming richer in software and services. We continue to shift our mix to higher growth markets and more IP reach offerings. And we continue to invest in our go-to-market capabilities that they are solution-led and outcome-based.\nSince we began our as-a-service pivot in 2019, our ARR has more than doubled to $963 million. We exited fiscal year 2022 with more than $8.3 billion in HP GreenLake total contract value, more than twice what it was just 2 years ago.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we produced $28.5 billion of revenue, 5% higher compared to 2021 and above the 3% to 4% outlook we provided at the Securities Analyst Meeting 2021. We achieved this revenue despite not yet having booked all revenue from our Frontier exascale system, which was delayed because our customer needed to extend the acceptance time frame.\nThrough a combination of pricing actions, portfolio mix shift and cost discipline, we sustained our margins in fiscal year 2022 even in the face of supply constraints and higher components and logistic costs. We increased our operating margin moving 210 basis points from above 8.5% 2 years ago to 10.6% for fiscal year 2022.\nOverall, in fiscal 2022, our operational performance resulted in a record non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $2.02, which came in above the midpoint of the guidance we gave at SAM 2022 in Houston last month, despite ongoing supply impacts, foreign exchange challenges and our exit from Russia and Belarus.\nWe generated the second highest free cash flow in a fiscal year, a total of $1.8 billion, 3x what it was in fiscal year 2020. We exited fiscal year 2022 with free cash flow at the midpoint of the target we guided at SAM 2022.\nOur fourth quarter and year-end results position us for continued durable profitable growth in fiscal year 2023, and we are confident in the guidance targets we gave last month at SAM. Going into next quarter, we are optimistic demand will sustain globally. It is clear that customers view their data first digital transformation critical to their success and are prioritizing hybrid cloud solutions to propel them forward, particularly in these dynamic times.\nAs we look ahead for the next fiscal year, after many quarters of supply constrained in our market, we are beginning to see some improvements. Demand from the consumer sector is slowing, allowing some substrate capacity to shift to enterprise IT technologies. As a result, we have been able to reduce anticipated lead times for some products.\nWe are continuing to take proactive measures to mitigate supply chain challenges and we are working through our large order book, which has experienced no material cancellations. Over the course of 2023, we expect to see great and easy but not an end to supply shortages.\nDespite supply constraints, the momentum we are generating with customers for our HP GreenLake platform has been evident across our financial metrics. HP GreenLake offer customers a unified and automated secure hybrid cloud experience, integrated across the edge data center colocations and public clouds. It is open, so customers can take advantage of the choice in architecture, but also benefit from the consistent cloud operating model HP GreenLake provides for all workloads and applications across hybrid IT estates.\nWith a true cloud metering capability, HP GreenLake enables customers to flex capacity up and down based on their business needs while benefiting from a wide range of cloud services to protect and analyze their data. Our market-leading differentiators helped us attract more new customers to our platform during the fourth quarter than any other quarter before, leading to twice as many new HP GreenLake logos to end fiscal year 2022 than we had a year prior.\nAlso, customers are consuming more HP GreenLake services increasing usage above the original contract commitments. Our partners are also seeing the relevance of HP GreenLake with our customers. Partners booked more HP GreenLake orders during the fourth quarter than they ever did before, extending the streak of orders growth to 22 consecutive quarters.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we also saw a greater share of partners booking multiple HP GreenLake deals. Next week, we will meet face-to-face with several thousand customers and partners at HPE Discover Frankfurt, to discuss hybrid cloud transformation strategies, ways to drive value from the data across HP cloud and how to bring the cloud experience to applications and data with HP GreenLake.\nAt the event, we will unveil important updates to our HP GreenLake platform. One European customer who has recently adopted the HP GreenLake platform is SPAR. SPAR is the supermarket you see everywhere in Europe from micro roadside convenience stores to massive one-stop hypermarket. SPAR has decided to build its own hybrid cloud on HP GreenLake to run the company's core business. Our platform is running all major applications of SPAR's innovation engine as the retailer pursues its ambition to create the future of grocery and retail shopping.\nThe HP GreenLake platform also helps SPAR use data to make strategic decisions on everything from warehousing and logistics to in-store experiences to advance its business. HP GreenLake is playing an increasingly important role in customers' IT strategies and in addressing all their needs with one unified edge-to-cloud experience.\nThis fiscal year, we performed remarkably well for our customers, our shareholders and our HPE team members. We helped our customers use technology to accelerate the business outcomes while navigating in dynamic environment. Our expanding market leadership demonstrates the trust that customers place in us and the value defined in the differentiated a supply portfolio that only we can deliver.\nDemand for our HP solution has been enduring throughout 2022 and continue to be steady as we move into fiscal year 2023. For our shareholders, by executing our strategy, we have pivoted HP to a richer mix of software and services that is delivering recurring profitable growth. In fiscal year 2022, we posted strong revenue growth, record-breaking non-GAAP earnings per share and outstanding free cash flow. I am so proud of our team members around the world who have made these results and our transformation possible through their ingenuity and engagement.\nIn fact, this year, HPE achieved one of the highest employee engagement scores in the history of our company, up 20 points over the last 5 years. Our culture has attracted some of the brightest, most innovative talent in tech. HPE's team members are bringing their energy and ideas to provide HPE's next chapter and cement us as the edge-to-cloud market leader.\nWith our team engaged, our strategy taking flight and our market-leading solutions playing critical roles in customers' business. We enter fiscal year 2023 with incredible momentum on all fronts. And I look forward to advancing our strategy and leadership even further in the next year.\nAnd with that, I would like now to pass it over to Tarek to make his comment and provide a little bit more details about our financial performance. So Tarek, over to you.\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. Q4 was no question, an outstanding quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q4 '22 and fiscal year '22 on Slide 4 and 5.\nLet me discuss our Q4 performance details, starting with Slide 6. Sustained demand continues to be a core attribute of our differentiated edge to cloud portfolio, which is translated to record or near-record results. As expected, year-over-year order growth continued to moderate in Q4 '22 to down 16% year-over-year as we lap challenging compares.\nHaving said that, our sequential order growth was flat relative to Q3 '22, which illustrates that demand for our products and services is steady. The key takeaway here is that we are entering fiscal year '23 with an order book that is even higher than the order book we entered fiscal year '22 with, which attests to our momentum for fiscal year 2023.\nNow that we have closed fiscal year '22, we will again turn our attention to focus on revenues rather than orders as we have been flagging. This is because of timing differences, orders and backlog are not traditionally good indicators of quarterly revenue in normal times. We will continue to disclose orders for our as-a-service and HPE Pointnext OS business.\nWhile the supply environment is improving, it is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. Our large order book contributes to our confidence in our fiscal year '23 revenue outlook of 2% to 4% growth adjusted for currency, and the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year '22 to '25 period we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in Houston last October.\nWe delivered Q4 revenue of $7.9 billion, which is up 12% annually and 15% sequentially adjusted for currency. This is the second highest revenue figure since our separation transactions in 2017. It would easily have been the highest had revenue recognition from the Frontier deal not slipped into fiscal year '23.\nThe Q4 sequential revenue growth is well above our prior outlook for at least 5% sequential growth. We have had healthy demand throughout the past 2 years. We now also have improving supply as supply capacity in the consumer electronics market is redirected towards enterprise markets where demand for digital transformation continues unabated.\nWe closed fiscal year '22 with full year revenue growth of 3% as reported. Currency and our exit from Russia and Belarus represented a 300 basis points headwind to revenue for the full year, which means we ended the year solidly above our initial guidance for 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency.\nOur non-GAAP gross margins remain resilient, thanks to the pricing actions we have taken. Our 33.1% non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 is up 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a very strong Compute quarter and higher logistics costs in the Edge business. We retain our pricing discipline and continue to shift our mix of business towards higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service offerings.\nNon-GAAP operating margins reached a record 11.5%, which represented a 100 basis points increase sequentially and a 180 basis points increase year-over-year. This result would not have been possible without the strategic actions we have taken back in fiscal year '20 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. These actions have put us in the position to benefit from an enhanced operating leverage for several quarters over the past 3 years, and this will continue in fiscal year '23 and beyond as Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity.\nOur cost optimization and resource allocation program announced during the pandemic of 2020 and which is now substantially finished, has achieved annual savings of $875 million, well above our initial target of $800 million. As a result, we are now rightsized and we are entering a very different phase of the company, one where the combination of our enhanced cost structure and substantial order book is expected to deliver profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold.\nThanks to revenue growth above our guidance, we delivered Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.57, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the highest quarterly non-GAAP net diluted EPS figure since our 2017 separations.\nOur full year non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $2.02 was at the upper end of our guidance range of $1.96 to $2.04 post Russia and FX and near the midpoint of our SAM 2021 guidance. Again, we estimate FX impacts on our Russia exit combined for a $0.17 EPS headwind in fiscal year '22.\nOur GAAP P&L reflects a noncash write-down of goodwill in our HPC & AI and software businesses. Macro trends, including contracting market multiples and higher discount rates used in our impairment test for HPC & AI and software, respectively, significantly impacted this outcome. We continue, nonetheless, to be bullish on the HPC & AI segment given our clear #1 position in the market. And our outlook for this segment is consistent with what we said at SAM 2022. And software remains a critical component of our HPE GreenLake strategy.\nI am particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in Q4 '22, where we generated $3 billion in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $2 billion as we work through our substantial orders and reduce our inventory. As Antonio mentioned, this brought our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion. This is triple our free cash flow in 2020.\nFor the year, free cash flow met the midpoint of our guidance. In fact, our full year free cash flow met our initial pre-Russia and FX guidance from SAM 2021.\nFinally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We returned over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders this year, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. We paid $154 million in dividends this quarter and repurchased $128 million in stock. That brought our buyback plan to $512 million for the year, above our $500 million target.\nOur as-a-service business momentum remains strong and this business is lifting our mix of higher margin recurring revenue. Total as-a-service orders remain robust. Orders grew 33% in Q4 despite lapping 104% growth in Q4 '21. On a constant currency basis, orders grew 43% in Q4 and our full year as-a-service orders grew 68%. This indicates the long-term health of our as-a-service portfolio and further strengthens our confidence in our 3-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25.\nOur ARR of $936 million represented 17% growth as reported and 25% growth in constant currency. For March of fiscal year '22, the industry supply constraints have limited shipments and weighed on our growth rate. We expect the improved supply environment to accelerate our ARR growth moving forward.\nWe also continue to expand our as-a-services margin as our mix of software and services increased to 66% in Q4, up 4 points year-over-year, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. As a result, the gross margins in our as-a-service business remain meaningfully above our corporate gross margins.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. All revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a record quarterly revenue number. We grew our revenues 23% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share across wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our Edge services platform and automation software suite. Our operating margin of 13.3% was up 2.4% annually, though down 3.2% sequentially with FX being the biggest contributor to the sequential decline. We continue to expect our Edge business to grow and perform like a Rule of 40 business moving forward.\nIn HPC & AI, revenue fell 11% year-over-year solely as a result of the Frontier deal slipping into fiscal year '23, which also impacted our operating margin in this segment. We are on track to close that deal in Q1 and have factored that into our guidance. We continue to have orders for HPC & AI solutions of about $3 billion to be delivered in upcoming quarters.\nCompute revenues grew 22% year-over-year to a near record of $3.7 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steering initiatives we have discussed in prior calls, as well as steadily improving supply availability. We have clearly outperformed the competition in fiscal year '22 and our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while maintaining a healthy margin profile. Our Compute operating margin of 14.7% remains well above our long-term outlook for 11% to 13%, which attest of the best-in-class performance delivered by our Compute business.\nIn Storage, we are very pleased to report 6% revenue growth led by all-flash array and HCI. Alletra is one of our fastest ramping new products ever and grew revenue 100% sequentially. In total, revenue from our own IP margin-rich products rose strong double digits in Q4 and contributed to an annual operating margin of 15.9%, which represents a year-over-year gain of 210 basis points and a sequential gain of 120 basis points.\nOur storage transformation is now in full swing, as you can see, and we expect our Storage business to deliver revenue growth in line with market with our own IP products growing above market.\nWith respect to Pointnext Operational Services, combined with storage services, orders grew sequentially and, for the year rose, mid-single digits in constant currency despite the exit of our Russia and Belarus business.\nFinally, HPE Financial Services expanded its financial volume 3% year-over-year, and revenue rose 6%. Our operating margins fell 3 percentage points year-over-year as we adjust our prices for a higher interest rate climate. It is worth reiterating that our leasing profit dollars are well insulated from a higher rate environment over time as we price under spread and that our business is resilient in a downturn.\nThroughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is currently nearing pre-pandemic levels of approximately 0.5%. As a result, our fiscal year '22 HPE FS return on equity remained well above the 18% target we reiterated at SAM 2022.\nSlide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP net diluted EPS performance. Antonio and I are very pleased that our strategic focus on both the top and bottom lines is evident in these results. Our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the volatile supply environment, the exit from our Russia and Belarus businesses and increasing headwinds from currency. As mentioned earlier, during fiscal year '22, we experienced a headwind of $0.12 from currency and $0.05 from exiting Russia and Belarus.\nIn spite of these headwinds, we met our SAM '21 non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year '22 and delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our edge-to-cloud strategy.\nThis improvement can be seen on Slide 10, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33.1%. This is a 10 basis point year-over-year improvement despite a significant revenue mix shift to Compute this quarter. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the supply challenges and the favorable mix shift we are driving towards higher-margin products across our portfolio.\nMoving to Slide 11. You can observe that we have delivered an 11.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the company. This is not only up 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially, but it is the highest operating margin in the history of the company since our 2017 separations. Our very strong Q4 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are certainly leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. And again, as I mentioned at SAM, this performance would not have been possible without the foundation provided by our resource allocation and cost optimization plan that we launched at the start of the 2020 pandemic.\nOn Slide 12, let's discuss our setup in China through H3C. As disclosed at SAM, we have extended our existing put option that is struck at 15x trailing 12-month earnings through to December 31, 2022. We did this to allow our partners time to finalize their engagement with their stakeholders and make our final decision regarding our stake in H3C. Through our commercial contracts and equity interest, H3C has contributed a substantial amount to our EPS and free cash flow and our shareholder value in fiscal year '22.\nWe will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this asset.\nOur cash flow story on Slide 13, a test of our outstanding execution. Our Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half.\nWe have been strategically building inventory ahead of the competition throughout fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 to navigate the supply chain environment. Our inventory balances have now peaked and are beginning to decline as we enter fiscal year '23 and deliver on our substantial order book.\nOur strong Q4 cash flow brought full year '22 cash flow from operations to $4.6 billion and our free cash flow to $1.8 billion. The $1.8 billion is triple what we delivered in fiscal year '20. It is also at the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion despite the negative impact of Russia and FX that we estimate to be approximately $250 million.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 14. As we discussed, demand for our products and services portfolio remained steady in Q4 relative to Q3. Our view remains one of enduring market demand given the mega trends of digital transformation and the explosion of data. We also believe our own portfolio differentiation will allow market share gains.\nLet me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure and FX risk. I would like to remind all of you that approximately 55% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies.\nFor Q1 '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a mid-single-digit seasonal decline that we typically experience in Q1 relative to Q4 of each year. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 to $0.58.\nWhile we are pleased with our Q1 outlook, we are cognizant given the macroeconomic environment and FX headwinds that it is too early at this stage to rethink our fiscal year '23 guidance. Given the points above, we consider it prudent to assume our year may be more weighted to the first half than is typical. We are, therefore, reiterating our full year '23 guidance. This includes revenue growth of 2% to 4% adjusted for currency; non-GAAP operating profit growth of 4% to 5%; GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.38 to $1.46; non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.96 to $2.04; and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.\nIn terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividends and expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23, just like we did in fiscal year '22.\nSo to conclude, our results speak for themselves in a test of our outstanding execution in a quarter that can be characterized by enduring demand for our differentiated portfolio of products and services. We look forward to continuing our execution momentum in fiscal year '23.\nNow with that, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Chuck, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.\n\nAndrew Simanek\n\nVP, Head of IR & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.\nAs always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.\nWe also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022.\nAlso, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency.\nFinally, after Antonio provides his high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Antonio.\n\nAntonio Fabio Neri\n\nCEO, President & Director, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nWell, great. Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. As we have demonstrated throughout 2022, HPE is delivering for our customers and our shareholders. In the third quarter, HPE grew revenues, increased profits and strengthen gross margins through steady operational focus and execution and despite continued tight supply conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange.\nIn our results, you will see the customer demand for our industry-leading portfolio. We continue to accelerate our recurrent revenue this fiscal year, which validates the compelling value proposition we offer our customers, and the long and the strong response to HPE GreenLake, our unified Edge-to-Cloud as a service platform. Customers continue to prioritize investments in IT. They find HPE's technology solutions to be particularly relevant in today's complex macroeconomic environment where technology innovation is critical to accelerate business transformation and deliver important business outcomes.\nIn the third quarter, total HPE revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $7 billion, which was also above the sequential outlook we have given. New orders exceeded our expectations despite finally starting to decelerate the growth rates, bringing our quarterly exit backlog to another record level. That is significant, considering that for the previous 4 consecutive quarters, we have grown orders 20% or more year-over-year. We continue to see robust customer demand in the market and a high-quality, durable sales pipeline.\nOur HPE GreenLake customer base is growing, and our customers are voting for the workloads and data. In Q3, we doubled HPE GreenLake new level of growth year-over-year, and our existing HPE GreenLake customers continue to renew and expand contracts with us.\nThe HPE GreenLake platform has an exabyte of data under management and customers worldwide connect more than 2 million devices to it. The momentum is reflected on annualized revenue run rate up 28% and total as-a-Service orders were up 39% year-over-year, bringing our year-to-date orders growth to 86%. These indicators show enduring demand for our as-a-Service solutions, even while supply constraints limited some installations.\nOnce again, we expanded gross margins in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7% was up 0.5 points sequentially and matched the highest we have ever generated since we began our as-a-Service in 2019.\nWe improved non-GAAP operating margin even more than gross margin to 10.5% this quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48, a 9% sequential rise and 2% year-over-year.\nOur cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and our free cash flow in the quarter was $587 million. This is in line with our typical seasonality as we improve cash conversion cycles in the second half.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, the dynamics remained largely unchanged from the last few quarters, with certain components still in tight supply, which limited shipments. However, we have made progress in proactive measures we have taken to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, including still in demand to products that do not require supply-constrained components, offering new multi-sourcing options and implementing program design changes to our world-class engineering capabilities.\nWe could also see some easing in supply condition if consumer demand continued to slow and component capacity shift towards enterprise customers. Overall, we expect supply chain to remain challenged, supply to remain challenged into next year, although with some very early signs of potential easing in the near term. We remain focused on translating customer demand into profitable revenue growth, as shown in our Q3 results.\nCustomers continue to tell us that they need to drive their important digital transformation work while managing costs. And it is clear we commit those needs with our Edge-to-Cloud portfolio delivered through the HPE GreenLake platform. HPE GreenLake brings a unified hybrid cloud experience to our customers' data and workloads, enabling them to consume IT as utility.\nIn June, I was thrilled to joined 80,000 customers and partners, again, in person in Las Vegas at HPE Discover. We unveiled a series of new cloud services and enhancements for the HPE GreenLake platform to further advance the hybrid cloud experience for customers. We were particularly excited to announce HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, which addresses customers' desire for their own automated, flexible enterprise-grade private cloud.\nWe recognize the important role our partner ecosystem plays in our success and the success of our customers. To continue to expand our growing partner ecosystem and enable them to adapt to customers' evolving requirements, we launched a new program that helps partners build their business on top of our HPE GreenLake platform. Customers are entrusting HPE GreenLake with their most critical workloads and applications.\nJapan Card Network, Japan's leading credit card payment network and an existing HPE GreenLake customer expanded its contract in Q3 to add a 100% fault tolerance platform running on HPE NonStop servers, with an integrity -- with an integrated software. The new implementation will power the card net systems demanding, transaction-intensive applications as Japanese consumers rapidly increased use of credit cards and cashless payments.\nIn India, the country's largest public sector steel producer also expanded adoption of the HPE GreenLake platform to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. By modernizing its critical S&P environment with HPE GreenLake, the organization can respond more quickly to business demand and help reduced its data center footprint by over 16% to help reach sustainability goals.\nThese are just 2 examples of existing customers doubling down on HPE GreenLake platform to address new needs. We see this as an important endorsement of the valuable role HPE GreenLake plays in our customers' IT strategy.\nAt the Edge, we continue to drive innovation with our solutions. Aruba had an impressive quarter with revenue rising 12% year-over-year and orders increasing more than 15% for the seventh consecutive quarter.\nIn Q3, Aruba announced new AIOps capabilities to reduce the time IT teams spent on manual tasks like network troubleshooting, performance tuning and security enforcement. These new AI-based insights leverage Aruba's industry-leading data lake from more than 120,000 Aruba users who are now on the HPE GreenLake platform to enhance visibility, operations and the user experience.\nOur Edge technology was on display early this month as we created a secure network to power the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in the U.K. Aruba provided the games network connecting thousands of staff and volunteers and over 4,400 athletes across 20 venues and 38 concurrent events to ensure smooth execution of the games. Committed to leaving a legacy of digital sustainability in the region, HPE is now working with the local organization to make the technology used for the event available to the community, including schools and hospitals.\nAs data continues to grow and evolve rapidly, we are seeing customers use our technology to allow data in incredible ways. Catharina Hospital, one of the largest hospital and leading centers for heart diseases in the Netherlands is using HPE Ezmeral software to build a cloud native data lake house that security collects and analyzes anonymized patient data from internal and external sources. This will accelerate mobile training and tech anomalies among the 500,000 electrocardiograms already available for data analysis with higher precision to identify the correct diagnosis and treatment.\nAnd in one of the most exciting breakthroughs to showcase the power of AI at scale, earlier this month, I was pleased to visit the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to celebrate Frontier, the world's first fastest and greenest exascale supercomputer that HPE built for the lab. Frontier represents a new area of scientific discovery and innovation that will strengthen U.S. national security and industrial competition.\nHPE has a long history of industry first and one-of-a-kind innovation that advances societal progress. We see this as a part of our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We also delivered on our purpose through our commitment to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Early this summer, we took the bold step of accelerating our net zero carbon emission target by 10 years to 2040. Effective strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions are a cornerstone of corporate longevity, and we continue to help customers drive their own sustainable transformation.\nI'm proud of HPE's Q3 performance and the progress we are making to cement our position as the leading Edge-to-Cloud company. When I speak to customers, it is very rewarding to hear how they are using our differentiated portfolio to solve their most critical business problems. Every day, we are proving how essential HPE is to the customers and communities we serve. We couldn't do this without the dedication of our 60,000 team members who impress me every day with their bold innovation and disciplined execution.\nWe have crafted a strategy at HPE that is winning in the marketplace, and I'm confident in our ability to execute on our commitments with strong demand, a solid pipeline and a unique Edge-to-Cloud offering that is delivering revenue growth and expanded gross margins and operating margins for our company.\nI look forward to updating you about our strategic priorities and outlook when we host our Security Analyst Meeting in late October. I hope you will join to hear how we plan to continue to generate value for HPE's shareholders.\nLet me now ask Tarek to discuss our performance in detail and go through our business segment results. Tarek, over to you.\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance.\nAntonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1. So now let me discuss our Q3 performance details, starting with Slide 2. We continue to see healthy demand across our differentiated Edge-to-Cloud portfolio. As expected, year-over-year order growth rates moderated to down 9% this quarter as we begin to lap challenging compares. As a reminder, orders were up 29% year-over-year in Q3 of fiscal year '21. We continued to grow our backlog sequentially this quarter to a new record level that is up 96% year-over-year. Our backlog is also expected to be roughly flat next quarter and remains firm with no meaningful cancellations. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting.\nIn Q3, we delivered revenue of $7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and above our outlook of up low single digits sequentially despite an ongoing challenging supply environment and greater currency headwinds. Based on current rates, we now expect currency to be a 2.5-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points expected at the start of our fiscal year.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the resiliency and expansion of our non-GAAP gross margins despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-over-year driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings.\nNon-GAAP operating margins were 10.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting operating leverage from strong gross margin and OpEx savings from our cost optimization actions taken during the pandemic. We expect to gain further operating leverage in the short term as we drive more revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio.\nWith our better-than-guided revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48, up 9% sequentially despite elevated input costs from the ongoing industry-wide supply constraints and foreign exchange impact. As previously indicated, cash flow from operations is following our normal seasonality this year, and working capital has also turned into a tailwind in the second half.\nIn Q3, we generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $587 million. We continue to make further investments in strategic inventory to navigate the current supply environment, and we are now at peak inventory levels. We will begin to work our inventory balance down next quarter and into the following year, and I'll touch more on that shortly in our outlook.\nFinally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We also repurchased $197 million in shares on track towards our goal of at least $500 million of share buybacks executed this fiscal year and bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $851 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation.\nSlide 3 highlights key metrics demonstrating our progress in our as-a-Service business with more recurring revenue at higher margins. Total as-a-Service orders remained robust, up 39% year-over-year as we begin to lap more challenging compares. Our year-to-date as-a-Service orders are up 86%, which is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business and supports our confidence in achieving our 3-year ARR CAGR target of 35% to 45% from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24.\nOur ARR growth rate improved from last quarter and was up 28% year-over-year to $858 million, but still face supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. We also continue to expand our as-a-Service margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q3, up 6 points year-over-year with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, we achieved both a record level of orders and revenue in the quarter. We grew orders double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and have roughly 20x our normal levels of backlog. Revenue growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak, and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double digits. We delivered operating margins of 16.5%, up 390 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the improving operating leverage in this business and this despite higher component and logistics costs.\nIn HPC & AI, revenue grew 15% year-over-year and backlog of awarded contracts remained robust at just under $3 billion. Our Q3 operating profit margin was 3.4%, up 9 points sequentially and is expected to increase further next quarter with the recognition of large deals.\nIn Compute, demand remained robust with backlog growing sequentially to another record and is now at 5x normal levels. Revenue was down 1%, reflecting a continued difficult supply environment with some improvement expected next quarter with new multi-sourcing options for certain components and demand steering towards new solutions. We also continue to be very focused on executing our dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.3%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and still well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%.\nWithin Storage, we achieved another record level of backlog and revenue was up 1%. We continue to emphasize our own IP margin reach products that were up double digits, including nimble and hyper-converged. Our as-a-Service offerings within Storage like Block are also leading order and ARR growth among our business segments. With the favorable mix shift, our operating margins improved to 14.7%, up 210 basis points sequentially.\nWith respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with Storage services, orders grew again and are up year-to-date mid-single digits in constant currency, similar to levels for total fiscal year '21 despite the exit of our Russia business. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenue and profits for each of our segments.\nWithin HPE Financial Services, volume increased 4% year-over-year in constant currency with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue rose 1%. It's worth noting that our leasing business is well insulating from rising interest rates over time as we price based on a spread and customers often choose to extend their leases during uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value realization and bad debt write-offs have returned to pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin was 11.8%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.5% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021.\nSlide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can see our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the difficult supply environment, the exit from our Russia business and increasing headwinds from currency. Year-to-date through Q3, we have already experienced a headwind of $0.05 from currency and $0.03 from exiting Russia.\nIn spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge-to-Cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on Slide 6, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-over-year, showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we have been driving to edge, on IP storage and our as-a-Service business.\nMoving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margins this quarter of 10.5%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 70 basis points year-over-year. This reflects revenue growth combined with both gross margin expansion and OpEx savings to give us strong operating leverage across the business. This has also been achieved while continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market in strategic areas of the business for future growth.\nOn Slide 8, let's spend some time reminding everyone about the status of our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in late April, we have extended our existing put option that is stuck at 15x trailing 12-month earnings through to October 31, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring and are now determining the longer-term path forward for our stake.\nWe value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although prior to the execution of any extension, we will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow, and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup.\nOur equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year '21 and has grown another 9% in this Q3. Needless to say, we will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this valuable asset.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion in Q3. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory throughout this year to navigate the supply chain environment. While we still expect to start working down inventory levels in Q4, it will take longer than expected and into fiscal year '23 but still puts us in a better position to convert the continued order demand into revenue and cash in future quarters.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, Antonio and I are very pleased with the continued demand strength and growing backlog that gives us confidence in achieving our original SAM revenue guidance in fiscal year '22 for growth of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency that now includes a 2.5-point headwind from foreign exchange rates on a full year basis.\nMore specifically for Q4 '22, we expect revenue to be up at least 5% sequentially as reported, which includes the larger currency headwind. This is still above our normal seasonality to reflect some improvements in supply due to the full resumption of factories activity in China and our actions to multisource more components and steer the demand.\nFrom an EPS perspective, we are tightening our fiscal year '22 non-GAAP outlook range as we move towards the end of the year to $1.96 to $2.04. This reflects the impact from the supply environment, which we expect to sustain into Q4 and further appreciation of the U.S. dollar since last quarter. As a result, this implies that for Q4 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.52 to $0.60.\nFurthermore, our free cash flow is also being impacted by exiting our Russia business as well as headwinds from unfavorable currency movements that were previously absorbed in our prior outlook. As a result, we now expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.\nSo overall, I am very pleased with our results in the quarter that can be characterized by sustained demand and very solid execution, navigated a continued challenging supply environment. With record levels of high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing Edge-to-Cloud opportunity and close out a strong fiscal year '22.\nWe look forward to seeing you at our next Securities Analyst Meeting in October to provide our outlook for the fiscal year and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions.",

Thanks for joining today's earnings call. HP's second quarter results reflect significant customer traction for our differentiated portfolio and underscore our progress in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. The macroeconomic environment of the last few months has presented enterprises around the world with strategic challenges that are usually not confronted all at once. The market shifts have certainly created a dynamic backdrop for our global customers and have made it harder for them to realize their goals in the short term.\nBut more than ever, organizations need technology partners to help them weather challenges while successfully digitizing and transforming their businesses in order to increase their market competitiveness. HP's ability to address these customer needs was key to our performance in the second quarter.\nOnce again, HP generated significant orders growth, steady revenue and sustained profitability, even as tight supply conditions continued across global industries. We are seeing persistent demand from our customers, underscoring both their IT spending prioritization and their attraction to our compelling portfolio. Very strong customer demand in the second quarter drove orders growth higher, rising 20% year-over-year, which makes this the fourth quarter in a row that HP has logged year-over-year orders growth of 20% or better. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform contributed to as-a-service orders doubling year-over-year, the third straight quarter of triple-digit growth.\nWe continue to see a great deal of customer interest in our platform, which is evident in our sales pipeline. Our orders backlog across the business is high quality, and we are now -- we are seeing particular strength in our Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, with orders climbing 45% and 23%, respectively. HPC and AI orders grew more than 18%, bringing backlog there to an impressive record of approximately $3 billion. Total HPE revenue rose 1.5% year-over-year to $6.7 billion against a record break in backlog of orders in the midst of industry supply constraints. ARR climbed 25%.\nWe have momentum across the portfolio with our as-a-service model differentiating us. This quarter, though, through a combination of supply constraints limiting our ability to fulfill orders as well as some areas where we could have executed better, we did not fully translated the strong customer orders into higher revenue growth. I am confident that we have identified where we can strengthen and expect continued improvement as we move into the back half of the year.\nImportantly, the quarter's biggest standout, even if we were somewhat limited by supply chain, is that we maintained non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, thanks to disciplined execution and timely pricing actions. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.44, which, together with our Q1 results, makes the first half of 2022 the second strongest EPS half year performance at HPE on a continuing operations basis.\nAs Tarek will detail for you, we are reaffirming our full year outlook of revenue growth of 3% to 4% and our long-term 2024 revenue CAGR outlook. We are also reaffirming our full fiscal year free cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As announced in February, we suspended all shipments to and sales in Russia and Belarus. We have now determined that it's no longer tenable for us to maintain operations in these countries. Therefore, today, we are announcing the closing of our operations in both countries and we'll proceed with an orderly managed exit.\nOur business in these countries represent less than 2% of HPE's total revenue in fiscal year '21. We have booked $126 million pretax charge related to the impact of Russia to our business, which is included in our second quarter GAAP earnings per share results. We expect less significant additional charges in the third quarter related to winding down these operations. Partially to reflect this necessary action and partially to unfavorable foreign exchange movement, we are updating our full fiscal year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to between $1.96 to $2.10, which is the guidance we provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last October.\nIn the short term, we recognize the supply and logistics constraints, rising inflation and evolving economic and geopolitical conditions are all contributing to a dynamic environment. However, enterprise demand continues to persist across our entire portfolio. We are focused on translating the demand we see in the market and a high-quality backlog into profitable growth while continuing to closely manage our inventory position. When even the supply of low-value components can be hard to secure in today's environment, we will continue to be disciplined and prudent in our decision-making to deliver on our commitments.\nAs we look to the future, we are strengthening the scale and resilience of our supply chain, including opening a new factory in the Czech Republic for next-generation HPC and AI technologies, which will help us address the very solid demand we have for these specialized solutions. There is no question that we have positioned HP well to help our customers double down on digital transformation. HP GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to deliver edge-to-cloud solutions to enable customers' data first modernization strategies.\nI hope many of you will join us later this month to see firsthand how our strategy comes to life when we host HP Discover live in Las Vegas for the first time in 3 years. We will have a lot to show you as it has been an exciting few months for our customers and for HPE.\nIn March, we announced features on HPE GreenLake that deliver greater choice and simplicity. We added 12 new cloud native services, with now more than the total of 50 cloud new services available through the platform. We also continue to expand our partner ecosystem, increasing the number of partners actively selling HP GreenLake this quarter by more than 50% from the same period last year. In addition, partners who sold multiple HP GreenLake deals in the quarter increased by 2.5x year-over-year.\nAt the edge, our capabilities are high demand as organizations need to securely connect distributed workforces and create engaging experiences. We are focused on delivering cloud-native services that can more easily embed intra-automated networks to absorb evolving networking configurations. And with the convergence of Aruba Central and HP GreenLake, more than 120,000 Aruba customers now have access to the HPE GreenLake platform.\nAs customers adopt hybrid multi-class solutions, we know they also need a secure and flexible on-premises cloud solution. We were recently selected as the prime provider for Google's cloud distributed hosted solution. HPE GreenLake will enable Google to deliver an on-premises cloud experience for organization with strict data residency, security and privacy requirements. Our hybrid cloud offerings have attracted nearly 150 new customers in Q2, including BMW Group, who is using HPE GreenLake to streamline and unify the company's data management across its global locations in the cloud and Worldline, the world's fourth largest payment provider, who chose HPE GreenLake to implement a major performance upgrade to its payment platform as it continues to deliver against a cashless economy vision.\nHPE Financial Services had a unique hand in the Worldline upgrade to HPE GreenLake, with our asset renewal program funding approximately 25% of the refresh.\nFrom a data perspective, we continue to make meaningful enhancement that allow customers to extract more insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. For instance, we are creating sophisticated AI models to generate and share insights in distributed environments. In April, we introduced HPE Swarm Learning, which enables users to share learnings through an AI model at the edge and from distinct sites without compromising data privacy. One university in Germany is already using HPE Swarm Learning to more accurately diagnose colon cancer by applying AI learnings that can predict cancerous genetic alterations.\nAnd early this week, Frontier, an HPE designed and built system became the world's first and the fastest exascale supercomputer, taking the #1 ranking on the world's top 500 list of supercomputers, exceeding the 1 exaflop performance threshold for the first time. To put this in perspective, this performance is 3x faster than the #2 supercomputer. HP has deployed 4 of the top 10 supercomputers and ranked first, second, third and fourth, on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nOur service pivot is also innovative in the way it helps our customers meet their sustainability goals. HPE Relay helped customers reduce their carbon footprint by more than 30% versus traditional IT models. Later this month, when we release our Living Progress Report, we will share more about our efforts to support our customers' goals, while pushing ourselves in the industry to improve our own.\nFew of us could have predicted that the challenges of the last several years would require enterprises to adopt so dramatically. I spent at least 50% of my time with customers around the world, and I can tell you that when they think about how they are going to reimagine their futures, they see HPE as an even more relevant and essential partner than ever before. As I reflect on Q2 and look ahead to the future, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments.\nWe have the right strategy to capitalize on market trends, with an expansive edge-to-cloud portfolio that's connected through our market-leading HPE GreenLake platform. We have significant momentum with our customers. And perhaps most importantly, we have been -- we have a truly stellar team. I am proud of the 60,000 team members who make our results possible and who help us deliver on our purpose as a company. This team will continue to innovate and execute in ways that will further set us apart and continue to create value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tarek to walk you through the details of our business segment results and overall performance.\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 3.\nWe continue to see robust demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, the same as last quarter. This marks our fourth quarter in a row with order growth of 20% or better year-over-year. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting.\nWe delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality despite a more challenging supply environment that limited upside. The unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China and ceasing the support of Russia services contracts impacted our revenue by more than $250 million in the quarter, our total operating margins by more than 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.06. Given the delta between our order and revenue growth rates, our backlog further increased to new record levels and yet remains very high quality. The order book is firm and most importantly, has been priced to preserve gross margins.\nWe are particularly pleased with the resiliency of our non-GAAP gross margins despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down just 10 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offerings.\nNon-GAAP operating margins were 9.3%, reflecting the revenue impact from incremental supply constraints and our exit from Russia that reduced operating leverage. We expect operating margins to expand in the short term as we drive more leverage from revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio.\nWithin other income and expense, we benefited from robust operational performance in H3C and further gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder investment portfolio. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year '22 to be an income of approximately $75 million versus prior guidance of an approximately $25 million income. Given our strength in gross margin and despite the approximately $0.06 impact from China and Russia, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44, near the midpoint of our outlook range of $0.41 to $0.49 for Q2.\nWe also delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.19. This includes $126 million of disaster charges related to Russia, primarily consisting of an increased reserve for financing lease assets. With the decision to already exit Russia that we have announced today, we expect to record an additional and less significant GAAP-only charge in Q3 that has been factored into our updated outlook already. As previously indicated, we expected free cash flow to be in line with our normal seasonality that is a use of cash in the first half and Q2 was a use of cash of $211 million. We have made significant investments in working capital during the first half, reflecting our strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow while working capital is expected to become a tailwind in the second half.\nFinally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July. We also repurchased $58 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $498 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation.\nSlide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We continue to see very strong momentum across our as-a-service portfolio, where we introduced 12 new cloud services this quarter and converged Aruba Central with the HPE GreenLake platform to create a unified operational experience for all users. Total as-a-service orders were up 107% year-over-year, marking the third quarter in a row with orders more than doubling.\nOur ARR was up 25% year-over-year to $829 million, with supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. While our ARR growth is somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q2, up more than 5 points year-over-year with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions accelerated with orders growing 45% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter with growth of more than 35%. Despite increased supply disruptions in China, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double digits.\nWe delivered operating margins of 12.6%, reflecting higher component and logistics costs, resulting in lower operating leverage. We expect margins to improve next quarter with higher levels of revenue that also benefit from previous price actions that are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with order growth of 18% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of just under $3 billion. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year and was impacted by 1 large customer acceptance delay that impacted growth by more than 6 points and has now been delivered in Q3.\nImportantly, our Q2 operating profit was impacted by the ramp in project costs for a couple of mega deals expected to close by the end of the year that will return operating margins to more in range with historical levels. In Compute, order growth remained robust and was up over 20% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was up 1%, reflecting a more difficult supply environment.\nWe continue to be very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistics cost and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.9%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%.\nWithin Storage, we achieved another record level of product backlog that is skewed towards our own IP margin-rich products. Revenue was down 2%, reflecting supply constraints for our own IP products. As a result, we continue to have unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we work through our favorable backlog mix and steer more demand towards our new Alletra and block storage offerings.\nWith respect to Pointnext operational services, including storage services, orders again grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported, similar to levels for total fiscal year '21. As you know, this is very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue was flat. Our profitability continues to benefit from higher residual value realization as customers tend to extend the use of their systems in a supply-constrained environment. Our operating margin was 12.6%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 20.4% remains well above the 18-plus percent target set at SAM 2021.\nSlide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can see we've maintained relatively constant levels from last year despite incremental supply constraints, in particular, from the China shutdowns and also our ceasing to support services contracts in Russia. As a reminder, this combines for more than a $250 million impact to revenue and a 1 point impact to total operating margins and an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS in Q2. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better quality of earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge to Cloud strategy.\nThe improved quality of earnings can be seen on Slide 7, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q2 of 34.2%, showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business.\nMoving to Slide 8, you can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 9.3%, reflecting the reduced operating leverage from supply challenges and our exit from Russia. However, we are achieving much better efficiency in our sales and office investments when measuring productivity on an orders basis. Given our high-quality backlog, we are also continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market for future growth.\nOn Slide 9, let's spend some time reminding everyone about our unique set-up in China through H3C. As disclosed in an 8-K in late April, we have extended our existing put option that is struck at 15x trading 12-month earnings through to October 31, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring, which is proceeding as planned before determining a longer-term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although we will balance, prior to execution of any extension, the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk.\nH3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow, and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year '21 and has grown 32% in this Q2 of fiscal year '22. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this valuable asset.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our free cash flow was a use of cash of $211 million. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality with the first half being a use of cash followed by a strong generation of free cash flow in the second half. The first half of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we strategically built inventory levels in Q1 that were flat in Q2.\nWe are taking further strategic actions to improve supply chain visibility and attain operational and financial benefits. This will put us in a better position to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash as working capital will turn into a tailwind in the back half of the year. We will need to demonstrate strong execution in the second half, but we have a path forward and expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 11. We are revising our fiscal year '22 non-GAAP outlook range back to our original outlook provided at SAM of $1.96 to $2.10. This reflects the impacts of a more unfavorable currency movements since last October, the exit of the business in Russia, the COVID-related disruptions in China to this date, offset by the other income and expense benefit we've received in the first half. From a top line perspective, we are very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.\nWe do want to remain prudent in the short term, given the ongoing supply challenges that we believe will likely last well into next year. Currency is also expected to now be a 2-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points at the start of our fiscal year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year '22 revenue growth outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year '23.\nMore specifically, for Q3 '22, we expect revenue to be up low single digits sequentially. This is slightly below our normal seasonality to reflect our expectations that the China shutdowns will have a lingering impact in the short term. As a result, for Q3 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.22 to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.54.\nSo overall, I'm pleased with how we are executing in a strong demand but challenging supply environment during the first half of fiscal year '22. With our high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing Edge to Cloud opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.",

Thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to address the evolving situation in Ukraine and how we are responding. Our first priority in the region is the safety of our team members, our contingent workers and their immediate families. We are conducting regular proactive outreach to our workforce in Ukraine to offer emergency assistance, making our security team available 24/7 to help.\nThe HPE Foundation has established a special giving campaign for our team members to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine which has already raised $150,000 in just over 24 hours. And we are expanding the time off we offer team members to volunteer, so those in the regions can care for their families and participate in humanitarian relief activities.\nFrom a business perspective, we have suspended all shipments into Russia at this time, and we'll continue to adhere through all relevant sanctions and export controls.\nNow let me review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Hewlett Packard Enterprise delivered a solid performance. The quarter was characterized by robust customer demand and profitability, demonstrating the strength of our differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy and our portfolio innovation. Our business pivot is further strengthening our gross and operating margins. As a result of our overall performance this quarter, we are increasing our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2022.\nIn Q1, we saw order growth of 20% from the prior year period, including 136% rise in other service orders. We increased total HPE revenue by 2% year-over-year to $7 billion despite continued industry-wide supply constraints, which slowed our ability to convert orders and record-breaking backlog to revenue. We generated a non-GAAP gross profit margins of 33.9%, higher than the prior quarter and prior year. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margin.\nFree cash flow was negative $577 million in the quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and proactive actions we continue to take to further buffer inventories in order to meet robust customer demand and forward-looking growth. The performance was -- we delivered this quarter was noteworthy in a macro environment that continues to be defined industry-wide by supply shortages and overloaded logistics channels.\nOur global operations team is mitigating impact by prudently building inventory where appropriate and leaning on our long standard supplier relationships. We continue to utilize our world-class supply chain engineering capabilities to adjust the type of components we use, shifting to those that are more readily available.\nWe are not seeing any noticeable order cancellations for customers due to elongated delivery times, and we'll continue to take pricing actions in this inflationary environment. As we discussed previously, we expect supply constraints will likely last well into the second half of calendar year 2022. Demand for our differentiated edge-to-cloud products and solutions continues to be very strong. With Q1 marking the third consecutive quarter, we have generated year-over-year order growth above 20%. This was also the second conservative quarter that our as-a-service orders more than doubled year-over-year. Customers are turning to HPE for a differentiated portfolio, adopting our solutions to drive their transformation at a faster and faster pace.\nSeveral key technology trends that are shaping the IT industry are aligned directly with our strategy to become the edge-to-cloud company through our HPE GreenLake platform offering. The edge is creating new sources of data. Our customers need secure connectivity to power the emerging distributed enterprise with remote workforces while delivering new digital experience to their shareholders.\nThe world is hybrid. Cloud is an experience that customers increasingly expect to have whatever the (inaudible) leads. The result is a growing demand for multi-cloud experiences, including clouds that live on-premises, at the edge, in colocations or in a public cloud. We have entered the age of insight and data is the most precious asset. Digital transformation is creating new possibilities for enterprises and customer needs solution to attract insights from the data to accelerate business outcomes. And when customers tell us they want to address this market shift, they are increasingly looking to do so through a flexible as-a-service consumption model that enables them to pay only for the IT they use. Customers seeking to capitalize on these market trend opportunities are turning to HPE GreenLake as the platform of choice. As always, Tarek will provide details about the business results for each of our segments.\nI will note a few highlights that underscore our performance this quarter as well as our innovation interaction with customers. Customers' requirements for a unified operating experience across edge-to-cloud and the desire to consume IT in a flexible way is fueling the tremendous orders growth of our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which saw record demand in Q1 with as-a-service orders up 136% year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we added more than 100 new HPE GreenLake customers, bringing the total count to more than now 1,350 customers who have adopted the HPE GreenLake platform for its -- because of its compelling value proposition. Among the new HPE GreenLake customers we announced in Q1 was Barclays, which has used in HPE GreenLake to deliver its private cloud platform as a part of the bank's hybrid multi-cloud strategy and digital transformation across its global banking businesses.\nThe traction we are seeing in the market for HPE GreenLake is driving us to further accelerate the transformation of HPE into an edge-to-cloud company. On March 22, we will unveil significant new innovations and enhancements to our HPE GreenLake platform to help customers manage their hybrid clouds more easily, protect and get more value from their data and securely connect at the edge.\nOur as-a-service transformation is my number one priority, and it is already delivering results for our shareholders as evidenced in our Q1 performance and increased non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2022.\nOur other service pivot is accelerating our momentum in key growth businesses. Our Intelligent Edge business segment grew revenues 11% year-over-year. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, so year-over-year orders growth of over 35%, driven by the very strong demand in secure connectivity from edge-to-cloud. Our Aruba Edge cloud offerings continue to garner new customers.\nThe Aruba Central Cloud Native platform now manages more than 120,000 customers and more than 1.9 million network devices. In Q1, we announced that our Aruba Cloud-managed branch offering is being adopted by Brasfield & Gorrie, one of the largest private and health construction companies in the United States.\nThe company is using our networking portfolio to elevate their construction site innovation with impressive tools like virtual reality views of projects before they are built. Also in the quarter, we introduced the Aruba Edge Connect Micro branch, an industry-leading home office, cloud-based networking solution that lets remote personnel work seamlessly and securely wherever they are located.\nOur high performance computing and AI business also generated a noteworthy product order growth of more than 20% year-over-year, which has increased our total order book to a record of approximately $2.7 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we announced a win with the United States Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory to build a new supercomputer that will advance R&D for tomorrow's clean energy systems.\nOur computing storage businesses experienced robust order growth and outstanding profitability. In Q1, nearly 10% of computing storage orders were sold as a service. Compute generated more than 20% order growth year-over-year, expanded gross margins and attractive operating margins, up 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong pricing discipline. Storage drove product order growth of more than 15% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter.\nInnovation is unrelenting as we transform this segment into a data services business. For example, in Q1, our venture arm, \"Hewlett Packard Pathfinder invested in big ID.\" This is a leading data intelligent platform to help organizations realize detailed insights in their sensitive personal and critical data and then act on it.\nOur HPE Pointnext Services team is helping customers navigate through their multigenerational IT journey while modernizing, building and running the new hybrid IT estates. In Q1, HPE Pointnext Services orders increased mid-single digits year-over-year.\nTurning to our workforce. We reopened all of our United States offices last month to those who wish to return after careful analysis for information and guidance from the public health officials. I was very pleased to meet team members in person at a new cutting-edge Houston headquarters. You may have caught a glimpse of our Houston campus innovation in the video that ran before this call. We look forward to the official grand opening in April.\nAlongside advancing our rewarding workplace, I also believe HPE has a responsibility to become a more climate-resilient company. And we know it is a priority for our customers and shareholders. HPE Financial Services plays an important role in our sustainability strategy, providing asset upcycling to customers, which means reuse of millions of technology assets, while freeing up capital for customers to reinvest in their businesses.\nCustomers are choosing HPE in part because of our portfolio sustainability attributes. In fact, in fiscal year 2021, we drove nearly $900 million in revenue from sustainability-related customers' engagements. I am proud of our team members, not just for bringing breakthrough customer-centric innovation, but for how they are bringing it to market. We are making bold moves to maximize what we can do for our customers and shareholders. It is this type of collaboration and engagement that's propelling our business transformation.\nIt is clear from strong customer feedback and momentum across our businesses that HPE is increasingly well positioned to capitalize on the edge-to-cloud mega trends that define our IT industry. HPE GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to pay by the company, and it is generating record-breaking demand with impressive profitability across our business.\nThis continue to be uncertain times. As we monitor the dynamic global stage, I am more confident than ever about our future and our ability to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders because of our strategy and differentiated innovation.\nNow I would like Tarek to talk you through the quarter's performance in detail. Tarek?\n\nTarek A. Robbiati\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\n\nThank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance.\nAntonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1, so now let me discuss our Q1 performance details, starting with Slide 2. We are off to a good start, delivering against our commitments for fiscal year '22 with strong momentum continuing to build across the business. The demand continues to be robust for our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, marking our third quarter in a row with order growth at or above 20% year-over-year. This bolsters our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting.\nWe delivered Q1 revenues of $7 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality despite a continuously challenging supply environment. As a result, our backlog further increased to record levels with a firm order book that shows no signs of double ordering or any noticeable cancellations.\nWe were particularly pleased with the quality of our earnings, including the resiliency of our gross margins despite the ongoing supply constraints that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offerings.\nNon-GAAP operating margin has also been resilient at 11%, slightly down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. We're achieving all of the expected savings from our cost actions announced midpandemic while continuing to make investments in our high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio to fuel further revenue and profitability. Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our investment portfolio and robust operational performance in HPC. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year '22 to be an income of approximately $25 million versus prior guidance of a $20 million to $40 million expense.\nAs a result of our strength in margins that more than offset the continued supply challenges, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, well above the high end of our outlook range of $0.42 to $0.50 for Q1. As previously indicated, we expect the free cash flow to be in line with our typical seasonality that is lowest in Q1, with a use of cash of $577 million for this quarter.\nWe also continue to take strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. Our inventory is now up $2.5 billion year-over-year to $5.3 billion in support of the substantial order book that we have. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow. Finally, we continued to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April. We also repurchased $129 million in shares during Q1, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation.\nSlide 3 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We made meaningful progress during Q1. We added more than 100 customers and well over $500 million of total contract value that brings the current total TCV to more than $6.5 billion.\nTotal as-a-service orders were up 136% year-over-year. As a proof point of our as-a-service pivot momentum as a service order growth has accelerated every quarter going back to Q1 of last year. Our ARR was up 23% year-over-year to $798 million with supply constraints limiting some installations. While our ARR growth might be somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong rate accelerated -- accelerating order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continue to increase to 64% in Q1, up more than 4 points year-over-year.\nNow let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions continued unabated with orders growing more than 35% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter.\nDespite increasing supply constraints, revenue grew 11% year-over-year with strength across the portfolio. Both wired switching and wireless LAN grew approximately 10% with Aruba Services up even stronger driven by our Edge as a Service offerings up strong double digits. We also delivered strong operating margins of 17.4%, this is a 650 basis point sequential improvement despite higher component and logistics costs, demonstrating that our price actions are sticking.\nIn HPC and AI, demand remains robust with product order growth of more than 20% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of approximately $2.7 billion. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year, but was impacted by 2 large customer acceptance delays that impacted growth by more than 10 points in Q1 and are now on track to be delivered in Q2.\nOur Q1 operating profit was obviously also impacted by these pushouts, and we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels going forward. In compute, order growth was up over 20% year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was flat, reflecting the difficult supply environment.\nWe have been very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.8%, up 240 basis points year-over-year and 440 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target of 11% to 13%. Within storage, product order growth was up in the high teens year-over-year. This was the fourth quarter in a row of 15% or better year-over-year product order growth. Revenue was down 3%, reflecting increasing supply constraints, particularly for our owned IP products. As a result, we had an unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter.\nWe expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we continue to shift our portfolio towards higher-margin products and supply constraints ease.\nWith respect to Pointnext Operational Services, including storage services, orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported similar to levels for total fiscal year '21. As you know, this is a very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business.\nWithin HPE Financial Services, volume increased 11% year-over-year, and revenue was down 1%. Our write-offs as a percentage of assets, excluding the impact of 2 frauds in the U.K. and Asia Pacific was 47 basis points, which is below prepandemic levels. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value's realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market.\nOur operating margin was 12.4%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.7% remains well above the 18-plus percent target set at SAM 2021.\nSlide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum entering fiscal year '22, and this despite a more supply-constrained environment versus a year ago.\nWe are also delivering a better quality of earnings with our portfolio mix continuing to shift to our higher growth and higher-margin businesses as we execute our edge-to-cloud strategy.\nTurning to Slide 6. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 of 33.9%, up both year-over-year and sequentially despite all of the increased component and logistic costs. This was driven by both strong pricing discipline and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business.\nMoving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 11%, representing a 130 basis point sequential increase. We also delivered roughly the same operating profit versus last year despite a more challenging supply environment while continuing to invest significantly more in both R&D and our go-to-market for the future, thanks to a much better quality of earnings and gross margins.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our free cash flow was a use of cash of $577 million. This is more aligned to our typical prepandemic seasonality if you look at Q1 in fiscal year '20 or the prior years. Cash flow in Q1 of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we have strategically continued building inventory levels. This will better position us to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash in the back half of the year, reflecting also our typical seasonality. We, therefore, continue to expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 9. Given our strong performance in Q1 and building momentum across the business, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range for fiscal year '22 by $0.07 at the midpoint to $2.03 to $2.17. From a top line perspective, we were very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.\nWe do also want to remain prudent in the short term given the ongoing supply challenges that we continue to believe will likely last well into the second half of the calendar year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of growth of 3% to 4% and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year '23.\nMore specifically, for Q2 2022, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down low to mid-single digits and are comfortable with current consensus. As a result, for Q2 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.18 to $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.41 to $0.49.\nSo overall, I am very pleased with our first quarter of fiscal year '22. Our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving strong demand across our portfolio. This enabled us to deliver a good start to the fiscal year with increasing momentum and a raised outlook. We are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021.\nNow with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2025 and updated guidance for select metrics. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP. I call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release.\nToday's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. Rob, over to you.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani, and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. This morning, I'm going to start with the highlights from Moody's strong third quarter results, and I'm going to provide some insights from our latest refunding [ well ] studies as well as some examples of how we're winning and the deep currents that we're operating in. But let me give you the punchline.\nWe delivered record quarterly revenue. We're raising our full year guidance across almost all metrics, and we continue to drive significant innovation throughout the firm all at the same time. Now following our prepared remarks, Noemie and I, as always, we'll be glad to take your questions. So with that, let's get to the results.\nWe finished the third quarter on a high note. Markets closed with the busiest September on record and Moody's notched a new record of our own. We exceeded $2 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever in our history, and that was up 11% from the third quarter of last year. Moody's adjusted operating margin was almost 53% in the third quarter, up over 500 basis points from a year ago, demonstrating the tremendous operating leverage that we've created in our business. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $3.92 in the third quarter. That was up 22% from last year, and that's particularly impressive given the tough comp in the third quarter of 2024, when we posted 32% year-over-year growth, on top of the 31% growth in the third quarter of 2023. And just to put this in perspective, we've more than doubled adjusted diluted EPS from the same quarter just 3 years ago, consistently strengthening the earnings power of the firm year after year after year. And all of this, while investing to harness the immense opportunities and the deep currents that we've talked about over the past several years.\nNow on to the highlights for our Ratings business. MIS delivered 12% revenue growth for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the third consecutive quarter, setting an all-time record. Our position as the agency of choice enabled us to capitalize on a healthy issuance environment and record tight spreads. And the strategic investments we've made in technology, analytical tools and talent are equipping us to meet surges in issuance volume and capital markets innovation.\nNow looking forward, the issuance pipeline is robust. Demand is solid, with spreads hovering around near record lows, and the refi walls continue to build. Additionally, demand for debt financing remains strong in areas that we've consistently spotlighted over the past year or 2. That includes private credit, AI-powered data center expansion, infrastructure development and transition finance. And you can see this coming through in some of the marquee deals that we rated in the quarter.\nFirst, we were the sole rating agency on the first of its kind emerging market CLO in APAC for the International Finance Corporation, which is a member of the World Bank Group. That was a very innovative financing vehicle for frontier markets. Second, our corporate ABS team rated a more than $1 billion data center securitization, also the first transaction of its kind, which is backed by 3 high-quality newly constructed data centers and their related leases. And third, we rated the largest Asian corporate bond ever issued at almost $18 billion with much of the proceeds being used for data center investment. And all of these are notable examples of deep currents driving demand for debt financing.\nAnd while those deep currents are driving new issuance, refunding needs continue to grow as well. Our most recently published refunding study shows that refunding needs over the next 4 years are projected to surpass $5 trillion. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2018 to 2025. That number is approximately double the dollar volume seen in 2018 and this gives us some real confidence in the medium-term growth trajectory for MIS.\nNow there's typically a lot of interest in these reports on this call. So let me just share a few key findings with you. First, nonfinancial corporate refinancing walls in both the U.S. and EMEA grew [ 6% ] over the upcoming 4-year maturity horizon. Overall, investment-grade maturities are up 5%, while spec-grade maturities are up 7%. And notably, within spec-grade, U.S. bond maturities have increased by more than 20%. And in EMEA, spec-grade bonds and loans each rose by approximately 20%. And all of this points to a favorable backdrop for future issuance and the mix is especially encouraging given that spec-grade issuance tends to be more accretive to our revenue profile. So for those of you interested in exploring the full reports they are available on moody's.com, or through our Investor Relations team.\nNow Beyond the refunding walls, we remain well positioned to meet the evolving market needs in private credit. And that's a theme that we've consistently highlighted on prior calls. Private credit continues to be a growth driver for Ratings. In the third quarter, the number of private credit-related deals grew almost 70%. Notably, Direct lending remains the smallest portion of our private credit related activity, while fund finance and securitization are leading the way in both deal counts and issuance volumes. Revenue tied to private credit grew over 60% in the third quarter across multiple MIS business lines, albeit off a relatively small but expanding base.\nWe're also seeing a growing number of private deals returning to the public debt markets for refinancing. And according to Bloomberg's [indiscernible] Insights, issuers are realizing material savings. On average, something like 200 basis points, but in some cases, as much as 400 basis points when compared to private market rates. And as I've mentioned before, this dynamic effectively acts as a deferred maturity wall as we see unrated private direct lending deals refi into the rated [ BSL ] market. And as this market continues to grow, we continue to invest in experienced analytical teams and methodological rigor to ensure Ratings quality.\nNow turning to Moody's Analytics. We delivered strong results again this quarter. Revenue growth was 9% year-over-year, including 11% Decision Solutions. ARR is now nearly $3.4 billion, that's up 8% versus last year. And we're delivering margin improvement ahead of our plans just earlier this year. Our cross MA initiatives are yielding results, delivering a 34.3% adjusted operating margin, up 400 basis points versus last year. And as a result, we're increasing our full year margin outlook for MA to approximately 33%, and we believe this puts us solidly on track to meet our medium-term margin commitments.\nNow we're continuing to invest in scalable solutions across high-growth end markets, while at the same time, simplifying the product suite and optimizing our organizational structure. So one example of that simplification. In the third quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Learning Solutions business to Fitch. We had a good run with our Learning business, but we felt it no longer fit the profile of where we're seeking to invest in scalable recurring revenue businesses.\nIn parallel with these portfolio simplification efforts, we remain very focused on the deep current driving demand for our Analytics offerings. And in M&A, that includes an increasing focus on physical climate risk, and enhancing and expanding our solutions to help customers embed AI more deeply into their workflows. On a recent trip to Asia, where we celebrated 40 years of Moody's in the region, I heard firsthand about two customers. We're investing in our Physical Risk solutions to understand the impact of extreme weather events, and both of these are outside of the insurance sector.\nFirst, one of the largest banks in Japan, and for that matter the world, is using the RMS models that are traditionally used by our property and casualty insurance customers to understand physical climate risk across lending and portfolio management. Second, we recently won a multiyear deal with an Asian regulatory agency to deliver Physical Climate Risk data to 11 banks and insurers. And this marks the first time globally that a regulator has purchased Moody's Climate Solutions on behalf of its financial sector. And this initiative enables the integration of Physical Risk Analytics into regulatory reporting, in core business functions, and also establishes a precedent for further regional adoption and collaboration.\nNow on AI, you've heard me talk before about the very encouraging engagement that we have with a number of large banks who are interested in leveraging our data and models in their internal AI-enabled workflows. And while these discussions have taken time to move through bank's risk governance frameworks, we're now seeing some tangible momentum. In the third quarter, we signed over $3 million in new business with a Tier 1 U.S. bank, which included solutions to automate credit memo creation and to deploy early warning systems across its real estate portfolios. These solutions are driving meaningful efficiency gains for our customers, are [indiscernible] time to decision and delivering a competitive edge. And this is a powerful example of how Moody's is uniquely positioned to bring together proprietary data, advanced analytics, software, and now Gen AI capabilities and agents into our customers' mission-critical workflows.\nNow these agentic capabilities are just one part of a broader investment strategy. One that's focused on unlocking the full potential of our data and analytics estate. And we're not only investing in how we build intelligent AI-powered workflows, but also in how we package and deliver our proprietary data and analytics, embedding that directly into our customers' internal systems and our partners' platforms.\nAs we've discussed on recent calls, partnerships are an important part of this strategy. And we're embedding our data into partner ecosystems, extending our reach while preserving the depth of our domain expertise. And this approach not only scales our impact. It also deepens customer integration, improves retention, and it will help to continue to drive durable growth across our portfolio.\nSo a prime example this quarter is our partnership with Salesforce, where we continue to see strong growth from our integrated suite of connectors that includes company phermographic data, news and other content. And this supports third-party risk management and compliance monitoring, among other functions, bringing Moody's unique data and intelligence directly into Salesforce's workflows with great success. We're now expanding our partnership to make available our proprietary Gen AI-ready data and analytics within Salesforce's Agent Force 360. And in addition, Moody's will make available on Agent Exchange, our new agentic AI sales tool, that I think I've talked about on prior earnings calls, and that elevates sales teams by automating lead prioritization and delivering predictive insights, leveraging our data. And this is one part of our broader AI strategy.\nSo zooming out, there are a few dimensions to that AI strategy. The first is our foundational AI agent builder platform that all of our employees can use to reimagine workflows and increase productivity. As we've highlighted before, we're delivering efficiencies in engineering and customer support and we're now setting our sights on sales, product development and a variety of corporate functions as well as ratings workflows.\nThe second dimension is our AI Studio Factory, which is a platform designed for agentic product development. And the third is our recently announced Agentic Solutions, enabling us to commercialize smart APIs, MCP servers and domain-specific agents that leverage our vast proprietary data and content estate and deep subject matter expertise.\nSo switching gears. We also continue to invest in growing our Ratings footprint in emerging markets. And this past quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in [ Merus ], the leading ratings agency in Egypt. And this transaction will deepen Moody's presence in the Middle East and Africa, giving us a very strong first-mover advantage across all of the region's domestic debt markets. And these -- and you've heard me say this before, these are generational investments as emerging markets, including China, are expected to account for more than 60% of global GDP by 2029. And to that end, of the approximately $30 trillion of debt outstanding in those markets, only about 10% is cross-border. That means that the remaining 90% is issued locally and rated locally. And that's why these domestic market investments are so important.\nSo before I hand it over to Noemie for more details in the numbers, a few key takeaways. This past quarter, we delivered strong growth, significant operating leverage, and we have good momentum heading into next year. And of course, just a quick shout out to all of my teammates for the fantastic work this quarter helping deliver one of the strongest quarters in Moody's history.\nNoemie, over to you.\n\nNoemie Clemence Heuland\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob, and hello, everyone. Q3 was outstanding. We showcased the full force of our earnings power. We are lifting both our top and bottom line guidance, and we're proving we can invest for growth and expand margins at the same time. So let's [ get right ] in.\nStarting with MIS, revenue grew 12%, a very strong result, especially given the typical softness in Q3. All Ratings lines of business contributed to the growth, supported by the constructive issuance environment. The largest increase came from leverage finance activity, followed by financial institutions, driven by heightened issuance from infrequent issuers, including fund finance and BDCs. Issuance totaled nearly $1.8 billion, marking the highest third quarter on record. This reflects a combination of factors we've previously discussed, including historically tight spreads, strong investor demand, and the announced rate cut at quarter end, as well as a pickup in M&A activity.\nMIS transaction revenue rose 14%, slightly trailing the 15% growth in issuance due to high volume of repricing activity this quarter. As noted before, simpler and less complex bank loan repricings typically yield lower revenue and are less favorable from a mix perspective. MIS recurring revenue increased 8% year-over-year, reflecting the impact on ongoing pricing initiatives, portfolio expansion and sustained monitoring fees. Foreign exchange contributed to a favorable 1% uplift consistent with the benefit seen in the second quarter.\nNow some color on Q3 transactional revenue by asset class. Corporate finance transaction revenue increased by 13%, supported by a 29% rise in bank loan revenue, compared to 58% insurance growth. This issuance surge was largely driven by repricing activity, which were bounded following subdued levels in Q2. Spec-grade revenue rose 43% and marking the strongest quarter for rated issuance since 2021. This was fueled by a positive investor sentiment and robust market access for these issuers. Investment-grade revenue declined 17% year-over-year, reflecting a 6% drop in issuance. Despite the decline, overall activity remained solid, supported by several large M&A transactions. Notably, Q3 of last year was the second highest third quarter on record for investment grade, driven by significant deal volume in the energy, oil and gas sector, creating a bit of a challenging comp base.\nIn Financial Institutions, transactional revenue grew 34%, significantly above the [ 3% ] issuance growth. This was driven by the strongest volumes in a decade from frequent issuers within the banking sector. Public, Project and Infrastructure finance transactional revenue remained relatively flat, reflecting weaker activity in project finance and sovereigns. However, this was partially offset by strong performance in U.S. public finance, especially within the regional and [ muni ] space. Structured finance transaction revenue rose 10%, and supported by strong activity in CLOs, especially new deals, driven by growth in leveraged loan formation. This was complemented by improving activity in U.S. RMBS, underpinned by sustained investor demand and healthy deal flow.\nAs Rob mentioned, private credit continues to be an important driver of MIS revenue growth, mainly from fund finance and business development companies, or BDC activities. First-time mandates reached 200 in Q3. That's up 5% year-over-year. Growth was strong across both North America and Lat Am, putting us on track to reach [ 700 to 750 ] for the full year. This momentum was partially driven by private credit-related mandates across financial institutions, structured finance, and private investor requested ratings in PPIF. As a reminder though, with the growth in private credit, some issuance activity will not be captured in rated issuance figures reported by external data providers.\nNow turning to margins. MIS delivered an adjusted operating margin of 65.2%, which is an expansion of 560 basis points year-over-year. And as a result, we are raising our full year guidance to a range of 63% to 64%.\nLooking forward and as shown on this slide, we are updating our issuance outlook by asset class. Our forecast for the remainder of 2025 assume continued momentum from the third quarter, even as we approach the typical unexpected normal seasonal slowdown towards year-end. We expect issuance growth to be mid-single digit for the full year with notable updates in investment grade, leveraged loan and high-yield bond issuance bolstered by improving M&A activity. As previously noted, we expect spreads to remain near historic lows despite some modest widening.\nInvestor demand remained strong and size of renewed M&A momentum are emerging. And that's actually reflected in the uptick in our Rating Assessment Service, or RAS business, which often serves as a leading indicator for M&A. In fact, Q3 marked record quarterly revenue for RAS. This reinforces our expectation that M&A will be a positive contributor as we head into 2026. In the near term, we're raising our estimate of M&A issuance to a range of 15% to 20% for the full year 2025.\nNow translating this to revenue, we now anticipate full year MIS revenue growth in the high single-digit range, and that's an upward revision from our previous outlook. Overall, we remain optimistic about issuance activity, but it's important to note that our guidance doesn't factor in a significant disruption like the one we've experienced earlier this year. Risks remain with ongoing tariff and trade negotiations, and the full impact of a prolonged government shutdown on market conditions is difficult to predict. That said, we believe we have accounted for the broad spectrum of the most plausible scenarios in our updated guidance.\nTurning to Moody's Analytics. This business continues to deliver an impressive financial profile. 93% recurring revenue, a 93% retention rate, and consistent growth at scale. Reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year, while recurring revenue grew 11%, or 8% on an organic constant currency basis. As we've talked about a lot in recent years, we've been actively reshaping the revenue mix by downsizing low-margin services and increasingly leveraging implementation partners across regions. As a result, transactional revenue continues to decline, down 19% this quarter.\nARR growth of 8% is consistent with last quarter. You'll notice some quarter-to-quarter movement in individual line of business growth rates, often driven by large new business wins or large attrition events. Across the portfolio, though retention rates consistently hold in the low to [ mid-90% ] range, and that supports high single-digit ARR growth. Now let me double-click into each of the lines of businesses to give you a clearer view of the underlying dynamics.\nFirst, Decision Solutions, which includes our banking, insurance and KYC, delivered double-digit ARR growth this quarter at 10%. KYC continues to be the fastest-growing part of Decision Solutions with sustained growth in the low to high teens over the last several quarters. This quarter, we reported 16% ARR growth, and I want to highlight two recent sales in the tech sector that illustrate the appetite for our KYC solutions beyond financial service customers.\nFirst, a large technology company signed a major deal to integrate Moody's Orbis data into its denied party screening system, helping block transactions with entities in countries of concern. This deal positions Moody's as a trusted provider of critical data for regulatory compliance and showcases our ability to address complex challenges with innovative solutions.\nSecond, a global social media platform is using Moody's to strengthen fraud detection and business verification across its ecosystem. Our data helps uncover hidden ownership structures, circular directorships and branding consistencies, streamlining investigations, reducing [indiscernible] review and accelerating decision-making. Insurance delivered 8% [ ARR ] growth this quarter, and there are a few dynamics worth noting given the diversity in the end markets we serve.\nFirst, growth in our Life Business remains strong and has been bolstered recently by customers adopting more sophisticated models and increased usage. On the property and casualty side, 2024 was a standout year for both new business and retention, with several large cross-sell wins and retention rates in the high [ 90s ], presenting a bit of a tougher comp. In our banking line of business, which includes our lending suite as well as risk, regulatory and finance solutions, we delivered ARR growth of 7% in Q3. Reported revenue was flat in the third quarter versus last year, influenced by the revenue accounting for multiyear sales of on-premise solutions.\nWith Risk, Regulatory and Finance Solutions growing at mid-single digit, the headline growth rate masks the strength of our lending business, including credit lends, which continues to grow ARR at a low to mid-teens pace and is the largest revenue contributor. We're investing to expand our offering into a more comprehensive solution that spans the full lending workflow. This approach is resonating with our core customer base. [ Mid-tier ] banks and is increasingly enabling us to cross and upsell across our solution set.\nNext, turning to Research & Insights. We delivered ARR growth of 8%, and that's an improvement as we lap last year's attrition events. Growth was further supported by strong upsell execution, fueled by our ongoing investments in CreditView, including research assistant and our suite of organic agenting solutions. Finally, data and information ARR grew 7% and continues to be affected by cancellations from earlier this year. On the positive side, we still see strong pricing power, sustained demand for Ratings data fees and strong Orbis new business volume.\nMoving on to margin. We delivered ahead of our initial plan so far this year with a 400 basis point improvement in Q3, and we now expect approximately 33% for the full year. This represents over 300 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion before absorbing a headwind of about 100 basis points from the three M&A deals within the last year. But let me be clear, we're not stopping there. This progress is rooted in programs designed to maximize investments in strategic growth areas and realize a more efficient organization footprint. We remain focused on expanding margins towards our medium-term commitment of mid- to high [ 30s ] over the next 2 years. To get there, we are prioritizing and redeploying R&D spend across our portfolio, redesigning enterprise processes with Gen AI, deploying productivity tools and optimizing vendor relationships. We remain confident in Moody's Analytics high quality, predictable ARR growth, and our ability to deliver sustained margin expansion, strengthening the earnings durability.\nNow to help with modeling, I'll walk you through a few additional details behind our updated outlook assumptions. And you can see the MIS [ NMA ] guidance update here on Slide 13. We now expect MCO revenue to grow in the high single-digit percent range. We are reaffirming our operating expense guidance, which supports an adjusted operating margin of about 51%, highlighting the strong operating leverage of our business. At the MCO level and excluding restructuring charges, we anticipate operating expenses to increase by $10 million to $20 million quarter-over-quarter, consistent with expectations we shared in the second quarter. We also expect incentive compensation to be approximately $100 million, in line with Q3.\nAs demonstrated by our margin performance, particularly in MA, our efficiency program continues to deliver meaningful improvements. We have already executed over $100 million of annualized savings helping offset annual salary increases and variable costs. We are updating our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $14.50 to $14.75, and which implies roughly 17% growth at the midpoint versus last year.\nOne [ modeling ] note on our tax rate. In October, a statute of limitations expired related to certain pre-acquisition tax exposures, Moody's assumed in the prior year M&A transaction. This will result in a onetime approximate 200 basis point favorable impact on our full year 2025 effective tax rate. Please note, this benefit will be fully offset by the release of the indemnification asset, so there will be no impact to net income or EPS.\nTurning to cash flow. We now anticipate our free cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion, and we are increasing our share repurchase guidance to at least $1.5 billion. That puts us on track to return over 85% of free cash flow to our shareholders this year.\nTo wrap it up, this quarter's results reflect the strength of our strategy and execution. We are approaching transformative shifts in technology from a position of financial strength, allowing us to invest in innovation while continuing to expand margins and grow revenue as seen again in Q3. And with that, operator, we're now happy to take any questions."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2025 and updated guidance for select metrics for full year 2025. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.

These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listener mode. Rob?\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Giovanni, and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. I'm going to kick off with some high-level takeaways on the operating environment and Moody's second quarter performance. Then I'm going to share some progress updates on our strategic investments and opportunities. And later in the call, Noemie is going to provide some details on the second quarter performance and outlook for the second half of the year. And after we finish our prepared remarks, Noemie and I will be glad to take your questions.\nSo on to the results. This past quarter, Moody's provided the insights and expertise that helped markets to make sense of a complex and rapidly changing global landscape. Second quarter, Moody's revenue of $1.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year. That's an impressive accomplishment given the April issuance air pocket and a tough comparable to the second quarter of last year when revenue grew 22%. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, delivering an adjusted operating margin of 50.9%. That's up 130 basis points from a year ago. And together, this translated to adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56. That's up 9% and that's actually 60% growth from the same quarter just 3 years ago. So it illustrates just how much the earnings power of our business continues to grow.\nOn the back of our second quarter performance, we've narrowed our guidance ranges for rated issuance, MIS revenue and EPS. Now starting with MIS. We continue to invest in strengthening our position as the agency of choice for issuers and investors. And that pays dividends in times of uncertainty when markets turn to us for our insights and the quality of our analysts. Our ratings franchise delivered $1 billion in revenue this quarter. That's just shy of a second quarter record. And it also marked our second consecutive quarter above the $1 billion revenue mark. And while April started off slowly with several days of no issuance, conditions improved meaningfully as we moved into May and June and market stabilized, spreads narrowed back to pre-April levels and issuance picked up significantly, and that helped to offset the early softness.\nBoth total revenue and transactional revenue growth were stronger than issuance growth. and this outperformance was partially helped by a favorable issuance mix and to a lesser degree, the growth in products and services not tied to issuance such as certain private credit ratings. Now looking ahead to the second half of the year, we're cautiously optimistic. The 4 key credit themes that we identified at the start of the year remain relevant and they could influence the balance of 2025 and beyond. And these include U.S. policy on trade, tax and immigration, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the fiscal economic and security impact of European defense spending and potential shocks triggering a pullback in risk appetite. Now one of the deep current driving demand in Moody's ratings that we've discussed a good deal on recent calls is the continued growth and evolution of the private credit markets. And we've invested and engaged to become an important voice in this space. fulfilling a critical need for more transparency and insights.\nIn the second quarter, we published a private credit webinar on the Moody's IR website. And it discusses the trends we're seeing in private credit and how Moody's is serving the market. We also hosted marquee credit conferences in both New York and London that drew nearly 1,000 people from across the entire private credit ecosystem. And these events demonstrate the tremendous convening power of the Moody's brand and also underscore how much interest there is in having us play an important role as the leading opinion provider on credit in this market.\nNow continuing the trend from the first quarter, private credit is an important driver of growth in ratings. In fact, in the second quarter, private credit-related transactions accounted for nearly 25% of first-time mandates, and the number of private credit-related deals increased by 50% year-over-year. Revenue related to private credit grew 75% in the second quarter across multiple lines of business in MIS albeit off of a relatively low base, and it was a contributor to how we delivered flat revenue growth amidst an issuance environment that was down 12%.\nA private credit investment plays an increasingly important funding role in key sectors such as AI data center investment, transition finance, energy infrastructure, and we are well positioned to address these growth opportunities. In fact, among others, we just rated a GBP 1.5 billion deal this quarter for a European utility company. That was the largest ever private credit related deal in the U.K. And as private credit grows, so too does the use of ratings in this space as the biggest players in this market realize that a credible independent assessment of credit risk, be it a rating or a model derived score from a trusted firm like Moody's provides additional transparency and comparability that broadens the investor base and provides a solid foundation as this market continues to scale.\nAnd in addition to how we're addressing this need in ratings, this was also an important driver of our MA partnership with MSCI that we announced back in April and this presents great opportunities for us to leverage the world's best commercial credit franchise with data, models, ratings and workflow to serve the emerging needs of a whole new group of investors and asset managers who now need enhanced credit underwriting and monitoring capabilities as they invest in this space.\nDrilling down into Moody's Analytics, our performance this quarter underscores the strategic role that MA plays in driving Moody's growth and earnings quality. And we delivered another strong quarter with 11% revenue growth and 12% growth in recurring revenue. ARR grew 8%, led by a 10% increase in Decision Solutions and recurring revenue held steady at 96% of MA's total, reinforcing the strength and predictability of our business model. And while we continue to deliver steady growth, I think what really stood out this quarter was margin expansion.\nMA delivered an adjusted operating margin of 32.1%, and that's a 360 basis point improvement year-over-year. And that puts us solidly on track to deliver our full year margin guidance of 32% to 33%. Now our best-in-class solutions continue to earn industry recognition. And recently, Moody's was ranked #1 in the charters quantitative analytics 50 rankings for the third year in a row, winning 13 individual categories. And these third-party awards. They're important because there are an external validation of our ability to deliver innovative and industry-leading solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. And this recognition has also acted in a strong engagement at our annual banking and insurance customer conferences.\nAt our banking conference, we showcased our integrated suite of products, including the advancements in building a fully end-to-end loan origination solution, incorporating key elements from our numerated acquisition. And this was a great validation of the addition of numerated front-end capabilities as well as the AI enablement across our platform. Our newly launched lending origination package that features numerated was adopted by several renewing customers as of early July with an average contract value increase of nearly 15% and notably, one of the largest Japanese banks cited the enhanced value proposition of the integrated offering as a key reason for their upgrade. And we're optimistic this adoption trend will accelerate as we enter a heavy renewal cycle in the second half of the year.\nOur insurance conference drew record attendance and showcased new model releases, enhanced underwriting capabilities and integrations with CAPE Analytics, which we acquired back in January. Feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive, especially around the fit and value of CAPE's AI-enabled geospatial intelligence, data and risk analytics in strengthening our catastrophe models. And we're really encouraged by the early traction here. CAPE's ARR is more than 10% higher than when we closed the acquisition, and we expect that growth to accelerate further through year-end, making it a meaningful contributor to our broader insurance portfolio.\nBeyond our Insurance Solutions line of business, we're seeing strong cross-sell into our insurance customer base. Several insurance customers adopted our [ max site ] unified risk and KYC platform. That includes a large multinational insurer in APAC that selected Moody's to consolidate multiple screening systems into a single streamlined solution. And that not only simplifies their operations, but it also validates our synergy thesis from the RMS acquisition. And while we delivered a strong quarter from both a growth and margin standpoint, we're not standing still. We continue to innovate, invest and partner to capitalize on the deep currents driving demand for our solutions.\nAnd you've heard me talk about how we're investing in the evolution of the markets this quarter. That included our partnership with MSCI to provide third-party credit scores on thousands of private credit companies and loans that we discussed on the last call. And this past quarter, we also made another investment in our domestic ratings franchise in Latin America, building on the really great momentum that we have across the region. We completed our acquisition of ICR Chile, which is a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Chile, which, in turn, is the third largest domestic bond market in Latin America. And we're going to integrate this business into Moody's Local.\nActivity in these markets remains very healthy with Moody's local new mandates year-to-date, up more than 30% year-over-year. and that reinforces the importance of continuing to invest in our leading presence across the region and thought leadership in the debt markets of tomorrow. And we also announced several exciting partnerships with major technology and data players, we're really excited about our data integration with SAP's new business Data Cloud.\nThe first dashboard product is set to launch in Q4, with more to come, and that opens up a new distribution channel for our data to thousands of SAP customers. During the quarter, our new onboarding agent leveraging our massive company database that we call Orbis was featured during the keynote at [ Coupa's ] Annual Inspire Conference, which drew over 3,000 attendees. And our risk data suite is now available in the Databricks marketplace. That's another important step in our growing partnership with Databricks and significantly enhances the customer access and integration to our content and offers new monetization opportunities.\nNow we know there's growing interest in understanding the contribution of GenAI to our business. And while sales of our stand-alone GenAI solutions are not material yet, we wanted to provide a few meaningful indicators to demonstrate the progress and value that Gen AI is already delivering. First, at a high level, is the deployment of GenAI across our portfolio. So over the past year, we've accelerated the rollout of our GenAI capabilities. And by the end of the second quarter, approximately 40% of our products measured by ARR now includes some form of GenAI enablement, whether offered as a standalone solution as an upgrade or embedded within the core product.\nA second way to look at progress is by looking at the growth of our total relationships with customers who have purchased or upgraded to stand-alone GenAI offerings from us. Their total spend across Moody's Analytics, measured by ARR is approaching $200 million. And that is growing at about twice the rate of MA overall. So this cohort of GenAI adopters show stronger and deeper engagement, and that reinforces the broader impact of our GenAI investments and innovation strategy.\nAnd finally, I want to share a milestone in our partnership with Microsoft, and we're excited to share that Microsoft will use Moody's as their primary operational data provider for customer hierarchy and organization data management. Moody's data is helping power decision-making across Microsoft's operations and plays a significant role in facilitating Microsoft's view of their customers. And this partnership integrates Moody's proprietary data sets into Microsoft's supply chain, compliance, credit and know your customer business functions. And the benefits from this partnership include enhanced risk management, AI innovation and cost efficiencies. And we believe this collaboration underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making and AI innovation in today's rapidly evolving business landscape.\nSo some good execution this quarter, even with a choppy environment in April, and we're confident in our strategy, building, buying, partnering, to capitalize on the powerful growth drivers shaping our markets. from expanding our Gen AI capabilities to deepening our presence in high-growth regions and forging strategic partnerships, we're positioning Moody's to lead in an increasingly data-driven AI-enabled world. and to deliver long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.\nWith that, now Noemie, over to you.\n\nNoemie Clemence Heuland\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Indeed, we delivered strong results in the second quarter, and I'll walk you through the details and provide some additional color. Starting with MIS, revenue was flat versus the prior year or declining by 1% when adjusted for positive FX movement effects, surfacing $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. The trends of transaction revenue against issuance growth implies a favorable issuance mix this quarter from corporate finance, structured finance and PPIF and the contribution of private credit.\nRecurring revenue increased by 7% year-on-year from pricing initiatives and portfolio growth. Now looking at our performance across asset classes. Corporate finance transaction revenue declined 6% year-on-year as bank loans issuance slowed and M&A activity remains subdued. Notably, there was a significant decline in repricing activity, which contributed positively to the revenue mix. Investment-grade transaction revenue grew 18% on issuance growth of 16% and as issuers took advantage of tight spreads, reflecting elevated demand for high-quality paper. As you probably have seen in the press, this was particularly pronounced in the TMT sector.\nHigh-yield transaction revenue was broadly in line with last year, with notably strong performance in EMEA. In financial institutions, transaction revenue declined 6% year-on-year driven by lower infrequent issuer activity primarily in the insurance sector. Structured Finance issuance declined by 25% in the second quarter as market volatility and wider spreads curtailed activity in April. Transaction revenue declined only 3%, helped by favorable mix, particularly from the slowdown in CLO refinancing and from higher average fees in other asset classes. Finally, public project and infrastructure finance grew 3% in transaction revenue, driven primarily by U.S. public finance. Issuance was largely opportunistic to get ahead of any impending policy changes and market volatility. It's also worth noting that in the second quarter, our U.S. public finance group rated the highest quarterly issuance volume since 2007.\nFirst-time Mandates were nearly [ 200 ] in the second quarter, which is very encouraging and keeps us on pace for our expectation of [ 700 to 800 ] for the full year in support of ongoing funding needs and the growth in private credit. In EMEA, first-time mandates were up year-over-year, driven by mandates in PPIF, which was supported by the increase in private credit. As private credit becomes a more prominent part of the market, it's important to note that some issuance activity is not captured in rated issuance figures reported by external data providers.\nMoving to margin. MIS delivered 64.2% adjusted operating margin expanding 100 basis points from last year. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, I'd like to say that the second quarter 2024 included a onetime legal reserve related to a regulatory matter, impacting the underlying margin expansion dynamics year-over-year. Taking seasonality into account, we continue to expect between 61% and 62% adjusted operating margin for MIS for the full year.\nTurning to Moody's Analytics. Revenue grew 11% in the second quarter and that includes about 4 percentage points of growth from M&A and FX. Recurring revenue grew 12% with organic constant currency recurring revenue growth of 8%, in line with second quarter ARR growth. Decision Solutions, which includes banking, insurance and KYC, continues to deliver double-digit growth. KYC led the way with sustained strong demand for our data analytics and workflows, serving customers across industries. KYC AR grew 17% last quarter and moderated slightly to 15% this quarter. The primary driver of this deceleration was the strategic termination of a long-standing redistribution partnership. We believe that this is in the best long-term interest of preserving the value of our proprietary data. Outside of this specific event, KYC new business growth remains strong, and we expect ARR growth to remain in the mid- to high teens through the second half of the year.\nIn banking, our portfolio of products, including our lending suite, risk and finance solutions as well as day sales from the legacy [ Race ] acquisition, among several other smaller product lines, delivered a blended AR growth of 7%. We are concentrating our investments on supporting customers across the entire lending workflow from origination to approval and beyond. Our flagship lending product, credit lands, it's proof of that success with low teens ARR growth and mid-teens new business growth, boosted by the ongoing integration of numerated AI and data analytics capabilities, which you heard Rob touch on earlier. Insurance Solutions delivered 9% ARR growth with a couple of dynamics to call out. An account loss following a merger dampened growth by about 1 percentage point and we faced a tough comparable against record new business in the first half of last year. That said, our new business pipeline is building nicely, growing at double-digit pace and we expect it will support at least high single-digit growth rates as we head into the second half of the year. Regarding the low double-digit growth with CAPE Analytics that Rob mentioned, I want to call out that this is not captured in the Insurance Solutions ARR metric as we wait to lap the anniversary of our acquisitions before including them in the light of business and overall MA ARR.\nTurning to research and insights. We delivered ARR growth of 7%, supported by continued innovation in Credit View. This includes contributions from research assistant, as well as a modernized user experience with new features, scorecards and peer analytics. We're also integrating real-time news and additional data sets to deliver richer, more timely signals driving growth through strong retention rates and pricing power. Finally, data and information ARR grew 6%, following some outsized attrition from the U.S. government in the first quarter, we remain focused on driving growth through strong retention and new business production. We're also making meaningful progress on improving MA's margin profile.\nAnd we're doing this by prioritizing investments optimizing vendor relationships, revisiting legacy org structures and deploying productivity tools across the organization. As a result, annualized compensation expense declined by 4% from the beginning of the year through June. We expect this continued rigor and discipline to support further margin expansion in the second half of 2025 and into 2026. So there were several discrete factors influencing performance across our lines of business this quarter. I wanted to provide transparency to help unpack the underlying drivers. Stepping back, Moody's Analytics continues to deliver high predictable high single-digit ARR growth now paired with strong and sustainable margin expansion. This combination of consistent top line performance and disciplined execution positions MA as a durable long-term growth engine for Moody's.\nTurning to the remainder of the year and our guidance. We are reaffirming our MA guidance metrics and updating our outlook for MIS issuance and revenue. These revisions primarily reflect better-than-expected second quarter performance and a weaker U.S. dollar. You can see the details on Slide 12. For M&A-related issuance, our view is largely unchanged we continue to expect 15% growth in announced M&A and flat rated issuance. That said, we're monitoring the environment closely, as macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty trends tends to disposal affect this aspect of issuance. Keep in mind, M&A is only one of many factors impacting overall issuance volumes. Insurance finished the second quarter ahead of our earlier expectations, leading us to update the low end of our prior guidance range. That said, uncertainty remains around several macro drivers, including tariffs, Central Bank interest rate policy, inflation, the path of credit spreads and the trajectory of M&A activity for the remainder of the year.\nThe low end of our issuance forecast accounts for potential short-life issuance air pocket, but does not anticipate a meaningful deterioration in the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment. On the revenue front, we now expect full year MIS revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percent range. and we believe there is more upside than downside at our midpoint. From a modeling perspective, taking the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate MIS revenue to decline in the low single digits year-over-year in Q3, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Q4. Our full year MIS adjusted operating margin guidance remains at 61% to 62%. For Moody's Analytics, we continue to expect both revenue and ARR growth in the high single-digit percent range, consistent with the outlook we showed in our Q1 call. We also reaffirm our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 32% to 33%, with a steady ramp of parts from the 32% we reported this quarter, reflecting both seasonality of revenue and expenses as well as ongoing expense management efforts.\nAt the MCO level, and excluding the impact from restructuring charges, we expect operating expense to ramp between $30 million to $45 million in the third quarter versus Q2, primarily related to our annual merit increases, followed by a gradual sequential increase in Q4. We anticipate approximately $100 million of incentive compensation for each of the remaining quarters of the year. Finally, our efficiency program continues to deliver results. We have already executed on annualized savings of over $100 million which are helping offset annual salary increases and variable costs as the year progresses.\nNow putting it all together, we continue to expect top line for MCO to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. with adjusted operating margin in the 49% to 50% range. Our adjusted -- our dated adjusted diluted EPS guidance range now implies 10% growth at the midpoint versus last year. Echoing Rob's comments, we are executing well on our strategy from a position of financial print. Looking forward, we are investing to capitalize on the secular demand drivers for deep current such as digital transformation, AI adoption and the expansion of private markets that are driving multiyear investment cycles for our customers and in turn, generating demand from when ratings data, analytics and workflow solutions.\nWith that, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their contribution to yet another strong quarter from Moody's. And operator, we're now happy to take any questions."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for questions and answers following the presentation. I will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, head of Invest Relations.\n\nI call your attention to the Safe Harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release.\n\nIn accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nand in other SEC filings made by the company which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the Safe Huber Statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward looking statements.\n\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in incident only mode over to you Rob.\n\nThanks, Shivani, and thank you very much everybody for joining today's call this morning.\n\nI'm going to kick off with some high-level takeaways on Moody's first quarter performance.\n\nand an update on our 2025 guidance. And then I'm going to share why we're confident in our market position and how we're strengthening the earnings power of the business. And after our prepared remarks as always, Noemie and I will be glad to take your questions. Thank you.\n\nSo on to the results.\n\nI think it's...\n\nSafe to say that the past few weeks have been more tumultuous than many have anticipated. Good.\n\nat the start of the year and there's certainly a lot of noise in the environment with equity markets demonstrating. Thank you very much.\n\nBut as you've heard me say before on these calls, it is times like these when our customers turn to us the most, and that's because we've got a vast reservoir of proprietary data and insights\n\nMission Critical Software Solutions, and decades of experience and understanding credit impacts to countries, industries, and companies. And we've done this all over the world across all sorts of economic cycles and geopolitical events, and this time is no different.\n\nSo amidst this backdrop, [inaudible]\n\nWe delivered some very strong results in the first quarter. We achieved a record $1.9 billion in first quarter 25 revenue. That was up 8% year-over-year year-over-year-over-year-over-year-over-\n\nIn fact, both of our businesses grew revenue at 8% [inaudible]\n\nand with some very disciplined expense management, Moody's adjusted operating margin reached 51.7%, that's up 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year.\n\nand Adjusted the Looted EPS Group, 14% to $3.83, and that really is the power of this franchise shining through.\n\nNow, turning to MIS, we delivered 8% revenue growth on issuance growth of 9% and MIS achieved its highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.1 billion with an adjusted operating margin of 66%\n\nAt this quarter, private credit was a meaningful contributor to growth, particularly in structured finance. In fact, in the first quarter of 25, we had 143 private credit-related deals. That's up from 69 in the first quarter of 24.\n\nRoughly a third of that volume came from private credit backed ABS, CLOs, and RNBS structured finance issuance\n\nand then BDC's and fund finance was almost another one-third. In fact, 20% of first quarter revenue growth and structure finance was attributable to private credit, so you can see private credit emerging as a tailwind for a ratings business.\n\nand amidst all the recent market uncertainty, engagement levels for our research and webcasts are at a rate two to three times the levels that we normally see in a more stable environment. In fact, last week's ratings webinar on terror are subtracted.\n\nRoughly 3,000 registrants across 89 countries.\n\nNow zooming out, the deep currents that I talked about on the fourth quarter call remain intact.\n\nand for MIS that includes private credit, transition finance, AI-driven infrastructure investment and emerging in domestic debt markets and these areas require significant investment and debt financing and this hasn't changed despite the recent turbulence.\n\nin a recent report on private credit. Our ratings team highlighted that data center debt issuance in the asset back finance market reached $4 billion in the first quarter of 2025 alone.\n\nAnd that represents the larger scale we expect to see more frequently to finance digital infrastructure.\n\nWe're actively evaluating several data center financing structures today across a number of teams and regions and these financing are early stage\n\nBut they are increasing in both their scale and complexity, and they're a good example of a deep current that we expect will drive death financing volumes for the foreseeable future.\n\nNow switching to MA, AERR growth was 9% again led by decision solutions where AERR grew 12%\n\nRecurring revenue increased another notch to 96% of total MA revenue.\n\nand we continue to make investments in product development, platform engineering, and sales capacity in our strategic growth areas.\n\nWe're also executing on our ambitious cost efficiency program designed to significantly enhance M.A.'s operating leverage over the coming years and for 2025, we remain on track to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of between 32 to 33%.\n\nNow, underpinning the 9% ARR growth, there's a very strong first quarter in terms of new business execution. I want to share a couple sales wins from this past quarter that illustrate that [inaudible]\n\nFirst was a multi-million dollar KYC deal with a major global bank to help them strengthen financial financial crime compliance.\n\nAnd building on that, we were recently selected as a global strategic data partner for their KYC program based on the high quality of our interconnected data sets. And that's a very strong referential customer for other major global banks.\n\nThe second was our first agentic AI sale in the KYC space with a major crypto trading platform that handles about a billion dollars a day in trading volume.\n\nIn the first quarter, we signed a multi-million dollar contract across a suite of our solutions [inaudible]\n\nand are the first customer using agent review. Thank you.\n\nwhich is our new KYC AI screening agent that helps onboard customers more accurately and quickly. And given all the manual labor in the KYC space, AI agents have a very compelling value proposition and we're excited about this opportunity.\n\nSo, more broadly, let me provide a quick update on our AI strategy across MA, and our focus remains on harnessing the transformative potential of generative AI to drive growth.\n\nto enhance customer experiences and achieve a more efficient operating model. On the commercial front, last quarter I talked about how customers who upgraded the research assistant contributed meaningfully to growth in the research and insights business in 2024.\n\nBeyond Research Assistant, we've introduced three unique generative AI offerings that highlight the power of integrating our proprietary data to accelerate decision-making for our banking and KYC customers . . .\n\nto the automated credit memo, early warning system, and the KYC AI agent that I just talked about.\n\nAdditionally, GNI navigators, now embedded in over a dozen MA product lines, are enabling on-demand customer support and improving user experiences across our solutions. And these navigators are helping customers maximize the value of our products.\n\nWe've also deployed generative AI internally across three of our most significant functional job families in MA, including customer service, engineering, and sales.\n\nIn engineering, we're rolling out increasingly advanced AI tools to empower our software engineers, setting ambitious adoption targets to accelerate road map delivery and drive innovation.\n\nWe've recently launched a transformative, internally built, agentic tool that will act as a sales companion for relationship managers and their specific books of business. [inaudible]\n\nIt's designed to act as a catalyst for tailoring our value propositions, for streamlining prospecting and meeting preparation and accelerating buying decisions. And as you might imagine, our sales and management teams are very excited about the prospects for productivity gains.\n\nSo these are just a few tangible ways that we're driving greater efficiency and effectiveness in important areas across the firm.\n\nSo anchoring this back to where I started my comments just a few minutes ago, Moody's value proposition is especially relevant in times of change and uncertainty. And we're doubling down on improving the earnings engine of our business and delivering strong results in the face of volatility.\n\nAnd while the services that Moody's provides are not directly impacted by tariffs announced to date, we do believe many businesses are being impacted by the uncertainty of impending trade tensions.\n\nand this uncertainty in turn leads to customers delaying financing and investment, and we've seen this in the first few weeks of April . As I think most of you would expect, we're taking a more conservative approach to guidance given the operating environment since we issued our initial guidance earlier this year.\n\nWe've widened and lowered our guidance range to accommodate a broader range of potential outcomes at this point in the year. Noemie is going to share more details in her prepared remarks, and I'm sure we'll address this further in Q&A. Thank you very much.\n\nNow, looking beyond the near-term dynamics in the markets, [inaudible]\n\nWe feel confident about the deep currents that are underpinning the demand for our solutions. First, the evolution of capital markets, including private credit. Second, the digital transformation and automation and financial services industries. [inaudible]\n\nThird, the imperative to know more about who you're doing business with. [inaudible]\n\n4th, the financial impact of extreme weather events, and 5th, the transformative power of generative AI and the tremendous unlock available from proprietary data. And I want to double click on a few of these for just a moment.\n\nNow, highlighted the growth coming from private credit. I'm particularly excited about the groundbreaking partnership with MSCI that we announced yesterday, where we're going to be providing independent risk assessments for private credit investments at scale. Thank you very much.\n\nand together we're serving a critical need for transparency in standards in the private credit market. Thank you.\n\nto support banks and their drive to digitize and streamline their credit and lending workflows. We've integrated numerated and able AI's front-end capabilities into our flagship lending solution, Credit Lens.\n\nCredit Line supports nearly 500 banks with nearly $27 trillion in assets.\n\nIn fact, Credit Lens ARR, which represents over a third of the total banking line of business ARR, grew at 12% over the last 12 months, demonstrating our ability to innovate and enhance our stale solutions and expand relationships within our core customer base. [inaudible]\n\nIn January, we closed our acquisition of Cape Analytics, a leading provider of geospatial AI data and location intelligence for property underwriting. And now we're integrating Cape into our industry-leading catastrophe models.\n\nand this is going to give insurers an incredibly high definition view of property risk, allowing them to ensure more confidently and with greater precision. Thank you very much.\n\nSo we feel good about the medium term given these deep currents, and we can and will manage through the short term.\n\nand we've got an experienced team and a strong portfolio that's built to weather storms and to provide insight when the market needs us most. With that, Noemie, over to you.\n\nThank you Rob and hello everyone, thank you for joining us today. This morning I'll start with our first quarter performance, then walk you through how we're thinking about the rest of the year.\n\nMCO adjusted operating margin improved by 100 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.83 was up 14% year-on-year.\n\nRecurring revenue grew 9% in line with AR growth. [inaudible]\n\nDecision Solutions, which include RKYC, Insurance and Banking Solutions, GRAR by 12% to nearly 1.5 billion dollars.\n\nAnd this line of business is consistently the fastest growing part of Moody's analytics, with AR growth of 17%, 11% and 8% in KYC, insurance and banking solutions respectively.\n\nResearch and Insights and Data and Information AR growth rates were 7% and 6% year on year.\n\nYou can see this breakdown on slide 7.\n\nDouble-clicking into MA's line of business results.\n\nKYC AR Growth was driven not only by our banking customers as Rob Illustrated earlier, but also by significant deals with corporate customers to vet suppliers and with European government entities to investigate fraud [inaudible]\n\nIn insurance, our climate and specialty insurance risk solutions and HD models are key differentiators in the market.\n\nDriving AR Growth of 11%\n\nIn the first quarter, we signed an exciting deal for our cyber risk models with one of the largest global property and casualty insurers showcasing that we are embedding ourselves in the insurance ecosystem across multiple risk domains. [inaudible]\n\nIn banking?\n\nAR grew 8%, as customers are increasingly engaging with us to automate and digitize their lending workflows.\n\nTurning to research and insights, now growing at AR at 7% .\n\nAnd finally, our data and information business grew AR by 6%.\n\nThe downtick and the growth rate over the last two quarters continues to be impacted by two dynamics that we've talked about in recent quarters.\n\nAn adjustment to our ESG strategy and attrition in sizable contracts with the US government.\n\nNow pivoting to ratings!\n\nRecord Corley Revenue was driven by corporate finance\n\nespecially from investment-grade issuers, and by structure finest, with continued momentum in CNBS and CLOs, as spreads remain tight and relatively stable 3Q1.\n\nand you can see this on slide six, and as Rob mentioned, private credit was a tailwind.\n\nIn the first quarter, first time mandates were almost 200, an increase of 20% year-on-year, broadly in line with our Q1 expectations.\n\nSo NetNet, a record first quarter, with very strong execution on the backdrop of a constructive issuance environment up to the first week of April\n\nNow, looking beyond the first quarter, we believe it's appropriate to pressure test our initial assumptions against the wider range of scenarios and update our guidance range accordingly.\n\nThe market remains very sensitive to factors, including fiscal and miniaturized policy news flows.\n\nEconomic Data .\n\nand the potential path and pace to a resolution. [inaudible]\n\nGlobal forecasts for GDP are being revised downwards and the magnitude and timing of central back rate cuts remain very much in flux.\n\nWe currently anticipate high yield spreads will widen over the next twelve months.\n\non the Global in Domestic M&A Front.\n\nEarlier expectations have been dampened by trade policy uncertainty.\n\nAs such, we now expect 15% growth year-on-year in announced M&A, down for 50% growth in our February\n\nSo how does this all translate into a four-year financial outlook? [inaudible]\n\nWell, first of all, we are pleased with the fact that Q-1 rated issuance was broadly in line with our forecast. Thank you very much.\n\nBut we're now projecting MIS rated issuance to decrease in the low to high single digit range for 2025.\n\nArrange accounts for various levels of activity in May and June after a somewhat muted April .\n\nand for variability in how quickly uncertainty resolved in the back half of the year.\n\nThe breakdown by asset class is in our slight presentation on slide 10.\n\nand more prolonged uncertainty was muted US GDP growth at the low end.\n\nThank you for watching. Please subscribe to my channel.\n\nWhile Robis deal-making activity in the back half, and healthy supply of high yield insurance in the near term are possible, and certainly supported by subdued MNA levels and maturity walls respectively.\n\nBye-bye.\n\nThere are two reasons for the AR Guidance Adjustment.\n\nFirst, we want to acknowledge that the fluidity of the external environment drives uncertainty with customers and could lead to delays in decision making as the year progresses. [inaudible]\n\nAlthough, it's important to note, this has not been the case so far.\n\nSecond.\n\nWe are reflecting higher than expected detrition with the US government than originally anticipated.\n\nThis includes the impact of what was realized in the first quarter and an increase in probability of attrition for contract schedule for renewal in the balance of the year.\n\nHaving said that,\n\nWe continue to build a solid pipeline of new business and believe the recent customer wins demonstrate Moody's analytics strong value for position even in this environment.\n\nOn the margin front, the efficiency program we announced in our Q4 call sets us up very well.\n\nIt provides us with the capacity to continue investing to capture the man from the multi-year deep currents Rob highlighted and deliver on our commitment to scale margins.\n\nbringing this all together.\n\nwith our adjustments to MIS revenue guidance. We expect for your 2025 MCO revenue growth in the mid-single digit range.\n\nwith an adjusted operating margin, expanding by about 100 to 300 basis points, to a range of 49 to 50%.\n\nOur Adjusted Deal with the EPS Guidance Range is a range of $13.25 to $14, representing 9% growth at the midpoint versus last year.\n\nThank you.\n\nNow for bottling purposes, we expect the counterization of top line and margin for MIS to be below the normal seasonal pattern for Q2, following the strong Q1 results and considering April issuance volumes.\n\nWe anticipate that revenue will remain stable between the second and third quarter before declining in the fourth quarter sequentially in line with historical norms.\n\nFor MA, we expect our year-over-year total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range, with sequential quarterly increases consistent with the prior year.\n\nTurning to operating expense and excluding the impact from restructuring and asset abandonment charges, we expect expenses to rub by about $15 million from the first quarter to the second quarter and gradually increase sequentially in the back half of the year in line with historical trends. [inaudible]\n\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital return, we have a strong financial profile and will continue the return capital to shareholders.\n\nCapital Return represents approximately 80% of our free cash flow, which is now expected to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the four year 2025.\n\nA going what Rob Shaird, we believe we are well positioned at the center of important deep currents and we are operating from a position of financial strengths. [inaudible]\n\nAnd with that, I'd like to thank all our colleagues around the world for their contributions to another record quarter of Moody's. And with that operator, we'd be happy to take any questions."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter 2024 as well as our outlook for full year 2025 and updates to our medium-term guidance. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for reconciliations between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani, and thanks very much, everybody, for joining today's call. After our prepared remarks, Steve Tulenko, the President of Moody's Analytics; and Mike West, President of Moody's Investor Service, are going to join Noemie and me for the Q&A portion of the call, and that's something that we've done for a few years now.\nBefore I get into our results, I just want to acknowledge that it's been a difficult few weeks for many members of our team following the tragic loss of our dear friends and Moody's colleagues, Chris Collins and Melissa Nicandri, in the Washington, D.C. plan crash. They really were cherished members of our team, and their loss leaves an immeasurable void, and our thoughts are with their families during this incredibly difficult time.\nNow on to our results. Moody's delivered a record year in 2024. We grew revenue by 20% to over $7 billion with strong growth across both businesses. And through disciplined cost management, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by over 400 basis points, and that translated into a 26% adjusted diluted EPS growth, all while executing on strategic investments across both of our businesses.\nSo MIS finished the year on a real high note, 18% total revenue growth, powered by 29% transactional revenue growth in the fourth quarter. And our Ratings teams were really active, and it wasn't just in the fourth quarter but throughout the year, delivering 33% revenue growth for Ratings and over 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year.\nMoody's Analytics also had a strong finish to the year with 10% recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 9% ARR growth. Decision Solutions continued to lead the way with $1.4 billion in ARR, growing at 12%. And as we look to the future, we're continuing to invest to deliver market-leading growth and attractive shareholder returns. And there are some very powerful deep currents that are driving demand across our business. And we've been making investments to ensure that we can capitalize on that demand.\nAnd thinking about the future, as we enter the third year since we introduced our medium-term targets, today, Noemie and I are going to provide an update on our key metrics and what underpins our higher adjusted diluted EPS growth range. So as we set out this time last year on last year's fourth quarter call, 2024 was a year in which we really doubled down on our investments in order to help us capitalize on some big opportunities that are in front of us. And we executed on those foundational investments that we called out on that earnings call at the start of last year, and those included platforming and modernizing, it included new products and also GenAI. And we focused on the accessibility of our data estate and also enhancements to our risk and resilience posture.\nAnd we continue to invest in the rating agency and our positioning as the agency of choice for investors and issuers. And I have to say I'm really proud that we were named Best Rating Agency for an impressive 13th year in a row by Extel, formerly Institutional Investor. It's our experienced analysts' insightful research and active market engagement that really reinforce our leadership position in the market. And that allows us, in turn, to capitalize on robust periods of issuance like this past year.\nWe've also made investments to address the big shifts that are going on in the capital markets. The first of those is private credit. And I'm not just talking about direct leverage lending, which is a roughly $1.5 trillion market and growing, but also fund finance, infrastructure debt and asset-backed finance, to name a few. And with dedicated analytical and commercial focus on private credit, we make really good progress in this space this past year, rating nearly 400 private credit-related transactions in 2024.\nSimilarly, we have a product suite to serve transition finance, and we issued over 150 second-party opinions and more than 20 net-zero assessments in 2024, and we have a very strong pipeline there as well. We also have a coordinated commercial and analytical initiative focused on digital infrastructure and data centers to ensure that we are the agency of choice in this space for the years to come.\nNow our strong financial performance this year allowed us to accelerate the build-out of MIS' technology applications for our analytical, commercial and operational teams. And these investments are driving improvements in operational efficiency and are allowing us to be increasingly volume-agnostic within a range of issuance. And you can see this come through in our 60% margins in 2024 and our guidance for 2025.\nSo I thought I'd just put this in perspective for you for a moment. We rated nearly $6.2 trillion of issuance in 2024. That's an increase of 42% compared to 2023. And Mike West has given me an interesting statistic that throughout last year, our Ratings teams issued a press release related to a credit opinion on average every 20 minutes. And that's without needing to meaningfully increase our analytical staffing levels. And very importantly, we did this while maintaining the robust controls that the market and our regulators expect from us.\nAnd as you've heard me say, we're always looking for ways to invest inorganically in Ratings because it's a great business. And if you recall, in mid-2024, we invested further in GCR. That's the leading domestic credit rating agency in Africa, taking our ownership up to almost 100%. And in November, we expanded Moody's Local again, this time into 6 more countries across Central America. And we're really pleased with the growth that we're seeing in Moody's Local. Revenue is up 16% in 2024, and we signed several hundred first-time mandates. So that's a great expansion of the rated portfolio across the region and really bodes well for the future.\nSo let me turn to Moody's Analytics for a few moments. We've invested there to enhance our product platforms and go-to-market strategy as we continue to deepen our relationships with our traditional customer base, banks and insurers. We've also expanded our data coverage and workflow solutions to serve large corporate customers in in-demand, third-party risk domains. That includes things like KYC, supplier risk, trade credit, transfer pricing and master data management.\nAnd within the last 6 months, we also made 3 important acquisitions that have enhanced our offerings in our banking and insurance businesses and added valuable data and analytics to our risk operating system. And those include Numerated, which extends our loan origination system for banks; Praedicat, which adds to our capabilities in casualty underwriting and analytics; and most recently, in January, Cape Analytics, which enriches our insights on properties and will integrate with our cat risk models.\nSo just a little bit more on Numerated for a moment. We've been collaborating with their team on joint offerings for some time, and that really highlighted the great fit between our respective lending workflow solution. So there was an obvious industrial logic to this. And we've had some really encouraging response from our customers. In fact, we've already had a few noteworthy wins with Tier 2 and Tier 3 banks in the fourth quarter with our enhanced end-to-end commercial lending offering, and it's really resonating with our customers.\nSwitching over to insurance. Over the last several years, we've talked about the foundational investments that we've made in our cloud-based intelligent risk platform. We call that IRP. And these investments are now delivering meaningful ARR growth for our insurance business. In fact, in 2024, we grew the number of customers on the IRP by almost 20%. And migrating to the IRP then enables insurers to reduce, sometimes by as much as half, the time that they need to model complex scenarios across billions of property locations. And as our platform hosts the most modern, sophisticated, high-definition models, our customers are able to better measure and quantify their financial exposure as well as monitor the evolving risk in their portfolios at scale. And this is helping to deepen our relationships with our customer base and expanding our strategic relationships with the largest global insurers, reinsurers and brokers in the world.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that for the third consecutive year, Moody's was ranked #1 in the Chartis RiskTech100, providing market validation of our best-in-class solutions serving nearly 15,000 analytics customers. So a lot to be proud of in 2024. And while we had a strong 2024, I'm very excited about 2025 and beyond due to a set of deep currents that are changing the way that businesses and markets operate. And given the investments that we've made over the last several years, we really are well positioned to ride those deep currents.\nAnd there are 5 that we are particularly focused on: first, the ongoing expansion and evolution of the debt capital markets that I just touched on; second, the increasing pace of digital transformation and automation across banks and insurers; third, the imperative for businesses to know more about who they're doing business with; fourth, the growing needs across industries to understand the financial impact of extreme weather events and a changing climate; and fifth, the transformative power of generative AI and the potential unlock for owners of proprietary data and insights.\nSo let me just double-click on the impact of extreme weather for a moment because this has been so much in the headlines lately. And on past calls, we've talked about the need to better understand the physical risk relating to extreme weather events and climate change. And when we announced the acquisition of RMS a few years ago, some folks asked us why did we think it was important to have these capabilities. Well, after Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the L.A. wildfires, I don't think anyone is questioning the need to better understand this. I really believe we are at an inflection point.\nIn fact, the issue of insurability of edits, both weather insurance is available and what the cost will be over time, has become a very important issue in property and financial markets. And we've witnessed the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, combined with ongoing property development and inflation, which have made these events even more costly. And the demand to better understand these risks, not just by insurers but by banks, investors, companies, governments, is only going up. And that's why we acquired Cape Analytics. Their AI-powered technology delivers address-level risk insights, which are a natural complement to our catastrophe models.\nAnd these sophisticated models, combined with our really rich and deep data and insights on credit and economics and properties, means that we are uniquely positioned to be the authoritative voice on quantifying the financial impacts of physical risk. And we see this need continuing for years into the future. So we feel good about these deep currents as durable demand drivers for our business. And Noemie is going to walk you through our full year '25 guidance assumptions in a moment.\nAnd as we look forward after delivering a remarkable performance in 2024, we're going to provide an update on the progress against our medium-term targets. But let me give you the bottom line: we have fundamentally strengthened the earnings power of this business, and that should support Moody's as a serial compounder in the years ahead.\nSo with that, Noemie, over to you.\n\nNoemie Clemence Heuland\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Starting with our Q4 results. We delivered a very strong finish, tapping a year of remarkable financial performance in '24.\nYou can see the highlights from our full year results on Slide 9. But Q4 revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 13% year-on-year. And our adjusted diluted EPS was $2.69 -- $2.62, up 20% year-over-year. MIS delivered its second highest Q4 revenue on record with growth across all business lines. The anticipated volatility around the U.S. election didn't materialize. And with spreads at their tightest levels in over a decade, particularly in spec-grade, and the robust demand environment continued throughout the quarter until the last days of December.\nMIS revenue in Q4 were $809 million, up 18% year-on-year. The growth was driven primarily by 3 key factors. First, healthy leverage loan issuance activity, which was up [ 134 ] in Q4. However, with the mix weighted towards refinancing and repricing, transactional revenue for that asset class was up 27%; second, the continued strength from infrequent issuers in the banking and insurance sectors; and third, strong performance from structured finance, and particularly in U.S. CLOs and CMBS, reflecting strong demand in a very favorable spread environment. MIS' fourth quarter performance and corresponding higher incentive compensation translated into a 51.3% adjusted operating margin, which exceeded our implied guidance.\nTurning to MA. We also had a strong Q4 with revenue of $863 million, up 8% year-on-year. Recurring revenue, which accounts for 95% of total revenue in MA, grew 10% year-on-year, broadly in line with the 9.4% growth in ARR. As Rob said, Decision Solutions drove the performance with 12% growth year-on-year.\nWe delivered strong growth across lines of businesses in Decision Solutions with banking, insurance and KYC achieving ARR growth of 9%, 12% and 17%, respectively. More specifically, KYC ARR grew 17% with strong demand from customer and supplier risk data usage and sales from new customers. Insurance ARR grew 12% driven by improved customer retention and strong demand for our cat model tools as extreme weather events are becoming more pervasive and impactful across industries. This is generating demand for our best-in-class risk modeling solutions with the IRP. And our Q4 -- Q1 2025 acquisition of Cape Analytics only builds on this, as Rob highlighted.\nBanking ARR grew 9%, reflecting strong customer retention and expansion of relationships with subscription-based offerings that are enabling customers' lending, risk management and finance workflows. The other 2 lines of businesses in MA include our more established data and research franchises. Data & Information grew ARR by 8% driven by demand from Orbis within the corporate sector. Research & Insights grew ARR by 6% with the attrition events from the asset manager space we discussed earlier in the year affecting the growth rate.\nThat said, sales, meaning cross-sell, upsell or upgrades, grew meaningfully above ARR trends in full year '24. And some of this was from upselling Research Assistant to our CreditView customers, which accounted for 25% of our overall Research & Insights ARR growth. We are encouraged by the customer engagement for Research Assistant, one of our GenAI offerings, and that's building a healthy pipeline for 2025 and has already reached more than 100 customers in Q4. MA adjusted operating margin of 33.8% increased 240 basis points versus Q4 last year, leading to a full year margin of 30.7%, which is towards the high end of our annual guide.\nNow turning to fiscal year '25 guidance. We expect MCO revenue growth in the high single-digit range with an adjusted operating margin [ increasing ] by about 200 basis points to approximately 50%. And this is on the back of a fiscal year 2024 where we increased adjusted operating margin by 420 basis points. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range is a range of $14 to $14.50.\nNow for MIS, we expect market conditions will remain constructive this year with tight spreads, declining high-yield default rates and an uptick in M&A activity. You'll see our issuance outlook for individual asset class on this slide. But all in all, we projected MIS rated issuance growth to be in the low single-digit range for '25 with 700 to 800 first-time mandates.\nFor MIS revenue, we expect growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent range for the year, benefiting from a positive issuance mix. We expect the revenue performance to translate into an adjusted operating margin of 62% to 63%, which at the midpoint represents about 250 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year.\nFor MA, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit range with ARR growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. We expect MA adjusted operating margin to be between 32% [ to ] 33%, which at the midpoint represents 180 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year.\nTurning to what underpins MA and the expected MCO margin expansion. We took a hard look at our operating model and believe we have an opportunity to simplify our organizational structure. In our Analytics business, we are, for the most part, through the integration of the businesses we've acquired over the recent years. We are also gradually reorienting our go-to-market from selling individual products to selling end-to-end solutions to our customers in the banking, insurance and corporate segment. This puts us in a position to combine resources in our customer-facing, marketing, product and data engineering functions and further consolidate our real estate footprint.\nAnd also more broadly across the organization, we're starting to reap the benefit of the investments we made in automating our workflows, which translates to expected improvements in operating leverage. So in connection with this, today, we're announcing an efficiency program to simplify the organization, allowing us to accelerate profitability expansion and redirect some investment capacity to strategic growth areas. We plan to incur between $200 million and $250 million in restructuring charges over the 2-year duration of the plan, primarily in personnel-related costs, for an expected total annualized cost savings in the range of $250 million to $300 million upon completion of the plan.\nWe accrued approximately $45 million already in the fourth quarter and expect to record an additional charge in the range of [ $8 million to $100 million ] in full year '25 primarily in Moody's Analytics and to a lesser extent within our corporate functions. I'd note that we have included the full year '24 to full year '25 operating expense bridge in the appendix of this presentation to assist with modeling questions.\nAnd here's some color on how to think about the calendarization of top line and margin. We expect MIS revenue in full year '25 to follow a similar quarterly pattern to '24, with first quarter revenue up in the mid-single-digit range from the first quarter '24, ramping up in the second quarter before declining sequentially in our third and fourth quarter. For MA, we expect our year-on-year total revenue growth to be consistent in the high single-digit percent range throughout the year with Q1 revenue being sequentially flat versus Q4 '24, a pattern that's consistent with the prior year.\nFor operating expenses and excluding the impact from restructuring and asset abandonment charges, we expect expenses to follow normal seasonal pattern. Sequentially, we anticipate expenses to increase by about $10 million from Q4 to Q1. And then we anticipate operating expense to follow a typical seasonal pattern but to remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of the year as savings associated from our efficiency program offset annual salary increases and variable costs associated with revenue.\nIn terms of margin, we expect MIS to be in the mid-60s in the first half before declining in the second half in line with revenue. And for MA, we expect approximately 30% in the first quarter, sequentially improving in the second half to achieve our full year guidance of 32% to 33% as revenue ramps and as we start to see the savings from our efficiency plan in the second half.\nIn terms of how these different dynamics translate into adjusted diluted EPS, we expect this to follow the MIS revenue cadence. And more specifically for Q1, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be at the high end of the implied quarterly adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.50 to $3.60.\nSo finally, looking beyond 2025, I'd like to talk about how we're tracking against our medium-term targets. It's been 3 years since we published those and with almost a year in the CFO seat, I'm using this as an opportunity to take stock on how our performance has stacked up.\nThe headline is this: 2024 adjusted diluted EPS is up 46% from 2 years ago. And the midpoint of our full year 2025 guidance implies an 18% adjusted diluted EPS CAGR through the first 3 years, significantly above the low double-digit medium-term target growth rate. Now a lot of this outperformance has been driven by very good execution during a robust issuance environment, with MIS revenue up 40.5% in the last 2 years and MIS adjusted margin already exceeding 60% in 2024.\nWe also have delivered strong organic growth in MA, reporting ARR growth consistently in the range of 9% to 10% over the last 2 years. As we look forward, we expect our retention rate to remain in the [ low to mid-90% ] range and to continue to grow our new business at low to mid-teens percent pace, enabling us to sustain ARR growth in this 9% to 10% range in the coming years.\nOf note, what's most notably different now from what we envisioned when we initially published our medium-term guidance is that our recent M&A has been at smaller scale and focused on enriching our offerings to fuel durable growth in our strategic growth areas, including lending and casualty underwriting.\nOn profitability, we've invested in GenAI and process automation more broadly for internal efficiencies. We've invested in the build-out of the MA platform and our data interoperability, all of which are expected to generate increased operating leverage in the coming years. We expect that this, coupled with our program to simplify our organizational structure, will translate into MA margin expansion in the mid- to high 30% range by 2027.\nNow bringing this all together, for MCO, we are increasing the range for our adjusted diluted EPS growth from the low double-digit percent growth to low to mid-teens percent growth range, reflecting our ongoing efforts to improve the earnings power of our business.\nTo wrap up, we believe the demand driver and the execution of our strategy will deliver attractive and sustainable growth and profitability expansion across market cycles. We remain committed to executing on our capital allocation strategy and anticipate consistent strong free cash flow returns to continue as we work to deliver on both our customers and shareholders.\nI'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their remarkable contributions to another great year for Moody's. And with that, Rob, Mike and Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

    "content": "Q2 2024 Moody's Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ2 2024 Moody's Corp Earnings Call\n\nMCONYSEJUL 23, 1:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, everyone, and welcome to the Moody's Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter 2024 as well as our revised outlook for select metrics for full year 2024. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for reconciliations between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP. I call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release.\nToday's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the Act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. I'm looking forward to talking about this quarter, 22% revenue growth and adjusted operating margin of almost 50% and 43% adjusted diluted EPS growth. That's great stuff. And as I have said before and I'm very proud to say it again, MIS is one of the world's great businesses. And when issuance activity ramps up like it did in the first half of this year, and you maintain such a strong position with investors and issuers like we do, as well as our ongoing disciplined approach to costs, we generate a tremendous amount of operating leverage.\nAnd for the second quarter, MIS delivered 36% revenue growth and a 63.2% adjusted operating margin, up 730 basis points from the second quarter of last year. And following another consecutive quarter of robust performance, we're again raising our guidance for both revenue growth and margin. On the MA side, we delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of 10% ARR growth with a 94% retention rate. ARR growth continues to be led by Decision Solutions, which grew by 13% this quarter.\nThat said, and while we see a strong pipeline for the second half of the year, we are widening our ARR guidance to account for the potential for a bit more uncertainty in the buying environment in the second half. And Noemie will expand more on our thinking around this later and I'm sure we'll discuss it in Q&A. In addition to the MIS guidance raise, we're also increasing several of our Moody's Corporation metrics, including upping our expectation for share repurchases for the year from $1 billion to $1.3 billion, and raising and narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $11 to $11.40.\nAnd we continue to innovate and invest, launching new products, expanding coverage, extending our partnerships, all to spur growth and position Moody's for long-term sustainable success. Now speaking of growth, MIS has truly established itself as the agency of choice, and that allows us to really capitalize on a market environment like we experienced this past quarter. For the first half of the year, we grew transaction revenue by 56%, and that outpaced issuance growth of 43%. And that was particularly evident in our Corporate Finance and Financial Institutions rating groups, which both delivered transactional revenue growth rates north of 65%.\nAnd when considering recurring revenue, overall total revenue grew by 35%. And the investments we're making to streamline and automate our workflows enabled us to meet the surge in issuance, and that's double-digit growth across all asset types while maintaining discipline around expenses. And even considering these investments, we're delivering adjusted operating margin up 760 basis points through the first half of the year.\nNow moving to MA. We had a strong first half, generating 8% revenue growth, and as I mentioned earlier, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth. We continue to focus on high-growth SaaS and subscription products, which are delivering mid-90s retention rates and now represent 95% of total revenue. And taking a deeper dive into MA, the businesses within Decision Solutions continue to deliver very good growth. And that includes KYC, which is delivering new and innovative features and functionality and remains the fastest growing business with ARR growth at 18% as of the end of the quarter.\nInsurance ARR growth was 6% at this time last year to now 14%. And banking delivered 9% ARR growth and for its purely SaaS offerings, a mid-teens ARR growth rate. Meanwhile, Data & Information delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth, and Research & Insights ARR growth remains at 6%, but we continue to expect the growth rate will improve in the second half of the year with the expectation of high single-digit percent growth range by year-end. And that's benefiting from the momentum with Research Assistant and our unrated companies coverage expansion in CreditView.\nSo how are we achieving all this? I mean, pretty simply, we're delivering mission-critical solutions, tapping into our risk operating system with massive data sets and analytic engines, all helping our customers navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected environment. Last quarter, I gave you a glimpse into our gen AI product road map, and I'm excited to share that we launched 2 new skills this past quarter. And the first of those is an automated credit memo, which saves bankers hours of work by assembling a credit memo, leveraging the bank's in-house content, Moody's content and third-party content.\nSecond is our early warning system, which is a cutting-edge gen AI-powered solution that's initially focused on commercial real estate that we launched last week. And this solution monitors breaking news. It alerts our customers, and that includes lenders, insurers, and asset managers to risks that could affect their portfolio and allowing them to query a broad range of Moody's data and models to quickly understand the potential impact of a given event. And we've got a number of institutions using both of these solutions in private preview mode, and we're receiving some very encouraging feedback. And they're both great examples of more ways that we are unlocking the power of our data, our analytics, our insights, leveraging gen AI.\nIn KYC, regulation continues to drive demand for new and targeted solutions. And this past quarter, we launched our sanctioned security screening tool, which allows asset managers to look through the ownership hierarchies of their holdings to the ultimate parent and flag those that are sanctioned. We also launched the European sanctions product. That was something that we actually launched in under a month, and it will help our banking customers manage new European reporting requirements on certain types of money transfers. And both of these solutions provide critical, timely, and trusted data to our customers, helping them avoid potential reputation or regulatory issues. And they're great examples of how we're broadening the use cases we serve, leveraging our massive company, people, and news data sets.\nNow these products wouldn't be possible without the investments we've been making in our Orbis database, which we believe is the world's best curated database of public and private companies. And we've more than doubled the number of entities we cover since we first acquired Bureau van Dijk. We added more than 20 million companies this year alone. And this past quarter, we reached a pretty incredible milestone with over 0.5 billion companies in our Orbis database. And this massive coverage is a great source of competitive advantage for us.\nNow turning to our Ratings business. I always say that if there's an opportunity to invest in one of the world's great businesses, we're going to do it. And that's why I'm thrilled to announce that in early July, we completed our acquisition of GCR. That's the leading African domestic credit rating agency covering 25 countries across the region. And GCR really is a fantastic franchise. They've got a very impressive management team. And this investment continues to reinforce our leadership in domestic rating markets around the world.\nWe've got a 30% stake in the leading rating agency in China. We've got very strong positions across Asia, in India, in Korea, Malaysia, and most recently, Vietnam. We've been enjoying great success with our Moody's local strategy across Latin America, and now we've established a leadership position across the African continent.\nNow we've also achieved an important milestone in our sustainable finance franchise in Ratings this quarter when we delivered our 200th second-party opinion in MIS, and we've got a healthy pipeline for the rest of the year. With the more recent launch of our Net Zero assessment, we now have, I think, a very compelling set of offerings to support sustainable and transition finance, and those are clear growth areas for the foreseeable future.\nNow you may recall back on the third quarter call last year, I talked about how we'd established a framework for third-party partnerships really to drive the ubiquity of our content in more and more platforms where people are making decisions about risk, investment and opportunity. And this past quarter, we had some exciting announcements on that front. First is our strategic collaboration with MSCI around ESG and private credit. And we really are excited to offer our customers MSCI's market-leading ESG scores and data through a range of our solutions, and MSCI will leverage Moody's Orbis database to extend its private company ESG coverage.\nAnd together, we're going to explore solutions that will leverage our company data and credit scoring models and MSCI's distribution and expertise with the global investment community to provide greater insight into the private credit markets. And just to be clear, our collaboration does not impact our ESG work in ratings nor does it affect our very extensive climate and transition capabilities across the firm.\nNow second, in June, we announced a new collaboration with Zillow that further enhances the insights available to both Moody's and Zillow customers. And starting this month, we're adding Zillow's extensive rental property data into Moody's CRE data platform. In exchange, Zillow will gain access to Moody's CRE market analyses, and that will help their customers make confident decisions around their multifamily properties.\nWe're also deepening our relationship with Google. Last month, they announced that they have tapped Moody's to be 1 of 4 foundational data providers that will serve as grounding agents for their enterprise Vertex AI platform. And this grounding opportunity is particularly exciting as it dramatically expands the audience for our content and further establishes Moody's as a trusted data source.\nAnd finally, back in May, we announced a first-of-its-kind enterprise risk management dashboard in collaboration with Diligent, and they're a leading governance risk and compliance SaaS company. And that's going to be offered as a separate module to their more than 700,000 board and leadership users, again broadening the audience for our content. So these kinds of partnerships are expanding the reach and mind share of our data sets and analytics to thousands of key decision makers while enhancing the offerings of our partners and ultimately in the service of helping us accelerate long-term growth.\nSo on that note, let me hand it over to Noemie to talk more about our financial performance for the quarter.\n\nNoemie Clemence Heuland\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.\n\nYes. Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on the momentum from the first quarter, I'm very pleased to share that we delivered a very strong performance in Q2. Our revenue was $1.8 billion, up 22% year-on-year, and our adjusted operating margin of nearly 50% improved by 590 basis points, illustrating our strong operating leverage.\nTurning to segment performance. Moody's Analytics revenue grew 7% or 8% on a constant currency basis. Recurring revenue, which represents 95% of our revenue in this segment, was up 9% year-on-year. And the adjusted operating margin was 28.5%, up 50 basis points from the second quarter last year. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $3.1 billion, up $292 million or 10% year-on-year. Our largest line of business, Decision Solutions, grew ARR by 13% with 150 bps sequential growth acceleration from Q1. Growth in this line of business was enabled by mid and high-teens growth from Insurance and KYC, where we continue to see strong customer demand for our best-in-class workflow solutions.\nData & Information ARR grew 10% with low teens growth in our corporate and government sectors, while our Research & Insights business grew ARR at 6%, a similar trend to what we've seen in recent quarters when we observed some modest uptick in credit attrition from banks and asset managers as we previously called out. Our overall retention rate remains high, around 94%, which is the evidence of the stickiness of our solutions. I do want to note that while this quarter marked the seventh quarter of double-digit ARR growth, we expect some moderation in our growth rates for this metric in certain areas of our business in the second half, which I will address when I talk about guidance.\nSwitching to MIS. Revenue was the second highest on record, growing 36% and topping $1 billion. Transactional revenue grew 56%, outpacing issuance growth of 47% and represented close to 70% of the total revenue for the quarter in MIS. We saw a positive mix from our investment-grade subsegment with transaction revenue increasing 28% versus a 10% rise in issuance, partially due to a combination of refinancing activity and several large M&A-related deals.\nAnd our Financial Institutions Ratings group saw a record level of revenue from insurance customers, primarily due to a favorable mix in infrequent issuers, resulting in 58% overall increase in transaction revenue against a 17% increase in insurance. Now tight expense controls and our increased focus on automation, coupled with the strong levels of issuance activity, enabled us to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 63.2%.\nAs Rob mentioned upfront, we are updating our guidance for a number of metrics so I'll start with the biggest change, which is the improved rated issuance outlook. Given the very strong start of the year and a slightly improved expectation for the second half, albeit with a notable slowdown from the first half, we're now forecasting issuance growth to be in the 20% to 25% range and revenue growth to be in the high teens percentage range.\nLooking out at the rest of the year, we now expect second half issuance to be roughly in line with the second half of '23, and we continue to expect Q4 issuance to be down in the mid-teens range versus prior year Q4, very consistent with our prior guide. So what's changed here really is we've taken the second quarter beat into our issuance numbers, and our outlook for Q3 is now a bit higher than it was previously.\nWe've provided some additional color on this slide for the various asset classes, and we'll be happy to talk about more of this in the Q&A. Given this level of growth, we're raising guidance across revenue and profitability metrics in our Ratings business. I'd like to take a moment to provide some high-level context behind our thinking. As we've consistently stated, we expect the first half of the year to be busier than the second half, and this view remains unchanged.\nFrom a macroeconomic standpoint, we have a positive outlook for the remainder of the year and expect global GDP to be between 2% and 3% for the full year. Our June default report, which was just published last week, is signaling that global default rates peaked in April and will continue to decline gradually in the coming 12 months. And we are also relatively agnostic to the timing and number of rate cuts expected later this year.\nNow with that context in mind, we are raising our guidance for MIS revenue growth to be in the high-teens percentage range. And we now expect full year MIS adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%. For MA, we're maintaining our guidance of high single-digit growth for revenue and a 30% to 31% margin. However, we're adjusting our expectations for year-end ARR to a wider range of high single-digit to low double-digit percent growth.\nOur current midpoint estimate for ARR growth is at the upper end of the high single-digit range. But taking into account a couple of strategic changes and more uncertainties that we usually have at midyear, we decided to make this update and provide you with some additional color on the factors that are notable. First, the partnership we announced with MSCI represents a commitment to our customers as well as a strategic shift in our offering. This change may impact our year-end renewals and reduce the sales pipeline for this line of business.\nSecond, while we were optimistic that tight purchasing patterns, particularly in banks and asset managers, would have improved over the course of this year, we continue to see very tight conditions in those customer sectors. This trend is most impactful on our banking, KYC, and Research & Insights line of businesses. And third, as we look toward the U.S. elections in the fall, we'd be remiss if we didn't note that the timing of certain upcoming renewals with U.S. government agencies could be impacted.\nOn a positive note, we also have several newly launched products: Research Assistant, which continues to be enhanced and has been gaining traction at higher price points; along with the new products Rob highlighted earlier, and these are all expected to be able to build pipeline and close deals as we head into the back half of the year. So all in all, our pipeline is strong, we're continuing to invest and innovate to drive durable double-digit growth in the years to come.\nNow bringing all this together, we now expect Moody's revenue to grow in the low teens percent range, expenses to grow in the high single-digit range, and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 46% to 47%. This expense guidance update of a high single-digit percent increase primarily reflects increases to incentive comp and the additional charge related to asset development, which we will take over the second half of the year related to the shift in our strategy to source ESG data and scores from MSCI. That's a noncash charge.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, I'm happy to share that we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion and are also raising our guidance for share repurchases by $300 million to approximately $1.3 billion. In doing so, we plan to return around 90% of our free cash flow to our stockholders in the form of buybacks and dividends for the full year 2024. And finally, as Rob mentioned earlier, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $11 to $11.40, a $0.50 increase at the midpoint, and that represents about 13% growth versus last year.\nSo I'll just wrap up by congratulating my colleagues on a very strong first half, and I'm very excited for what looks to be a very strong year. And that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, can we open the call up for questions, please?"

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the first quarter 2024 as well as our revised outlook for select metrics for full year 2024. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion & Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website.\nThese, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I'd also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good morning and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. Before I touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter results. I'm going to start by saying how excited I am joined today by Noemie Heuland, who officially joined Moody's on April 1. And as I mentioned on our last earnings call, Noemie brings almost 25 years of global financial and accounting leadership experience at some very large public companies with a real depth of experience in technology and Software as a Service. And we're really fortunate to have her as our Chief Financial Officer, and I look forward to all of you getting to know her in the coming weeks and months.\nSo with that, let me turn to our first quarter results. We delivered an impressive 21% revenue growth, capitalizing on a strong issuance environment and continued demand for our leading risk assessment solutions. We delivered strong top line performance and margin expansion in both businesses, and that translated to adjusted diluted EPS of $3.37 for the quarter.\nNow starting with MIS. Obviously, a great quarter. And over the last several years, you all have heard me talk about the investments that we've been making in analytical talent and technology enablement to ensure that we are the agency of choice for inventors and issuers, and in turn, position us to capitalize on more robust issuance periods. And in the first quarter, we did exactly that, and we showed the tremendous operating leverage in our business with the second highest quarterly revenue on record, up 35% year-over-year and an adjusted operating margin of 64.6%.\nMeanwhile, MA reported another quarter of 10% ARR growth, growing across all lines of business, including double-digit ARR growth in both Decision Solutions and Data & Information. And during the quarter, we executed on our strategic investment road map across platforming, product innovation and GenAI enablement. And this quarter highlights the unique strength of our business model. We're tracking to our medium-term EPS target of low double-digit growth while we are funding this investment program that will drive future growth, all while we expect to return over $1.6 billion to stockholders this year through share repurchases and dividends. That is the power of the Moody's compounding machine.\nWe're also updating a few of our guidance metrics, and Noemie will give some details on that a little bit later in the call. So we've got our eye on the ball, we're looking ahead, and we are focused on our mission to be the leading source of insights on exponential risk.\nSo with that, let's dive in a little bit more on the financial performance of our businesses this quarter and our latest expectations for the full year. And as I've said before, MIS really is one of the world's great business franchises. It's widely recognized as best in the industry with strong global coverage in cross-border and domestic debt markets, and it has a growing range of offerings to support growth areas like private credit and transition finance.\nAnd maintaining that leadership position really is critical in order to capitalize on the resurgence and opportunistic issuance that we experienced during the first quarter. And that's what played out during the quarter. MIS delivered, as I said, growth of 35% in the quarter, including 57% growth in transactional revenue. And a key driver of this growth in the quarter was the leveraged finance markets, a real strength for MIS, where revenue was up 144% versus the prior year quarter. That's quite a growth number.\nAnd as I explained a few quarters ago, we established a dedicated private credit team in MIS, and that's starting to pay dividends as we're better positioned to service the continued growth of the private credit markets as well as a wave of deals refinancing from the private credit markets into public markets. And while it's early, we're encouraged by interest in our transition finance offerings, and that includes our second-party opinions and our new net-zero assessment. And we already have several major issuers like Électricité de France that have published our net-zero assessment.\nAnd with discipline around expenses, MIS delivered an adjusted operating margin of almost 65%, again demonstrating the tremendous operating leverage in this business. Now while the first quarter issuance was very robust, it is still early in the year and there are some uncertainties. So we're a bit cautious in regards to changes to our full year outlook at this point in the year.\nIssuance in the first quarter benefited from pull-forward given the favorable market environment and questions about the back end of the year in regards to upcoming U.S. elections, ongoing tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty around U.S. inflation and central bank rate cuts. So consequently, we have not changed our full year issuance and revenue growth guidance targets. However, our updated outlook now centers on the upper end of both ranges. And there are some things that we're watching to determine if we've got some upside to our current outlook.\nThe global economy has certainly demonstrated resilience, and that's also going to be reflected in declining high-yield default rates, which are now projected to range between 3% to 3.5% by year-end. And we see some strong investor demand for riskier assets that's kept spreads tight. Notably, we're starting to see M&A activity pick up. Private equity funds are actively seeking exits and looking to deploy huge pools of capital. So again, there are some things that we're keeping a close eye on, and I'm sure we're going to discuss that a little bit further in the Q&A.\nSo now turning to Moody's Analytics. As we've seen over the years, MA continues to be a very consistent growth engine for us, achieving 65 consecutive quarters of revenue growth and now 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth. Retention rate has held steady at 94% for the last 2 years and yet again for the first quarter of 2024. And that's a real testament to the stickiness of our solutions.\nAs we look across our reported lines of business in MA, we can see our land-and-expand strategy in action. So starting with KYC, which I think you can see on the bottom far left of the webcast slide. About 1/4 of our 18% ARR growth in the first quarter is from new customer acquisitions. So a lot of new logos adopting our solutions in this space.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, about 90% of our insurance ARR growth of 10% is from really strong execution of our cross-sell strategy across our existing customer base. Clearly, RMS is an important contributor to that, and it continues to deliver against the targets that we set back in 2021.\nAnd I think a number of you will remember that at the time of the acquisition, RMS was growing at a low single-digit pace, and it's moved up very nicely as we've made progress on migrating customers to our SaaS platform and really activating our cross-selling strategies. And that includes things like climate models to banks and conversely selling data and analytics and other Moody's solutions to the RMS customer base. So when we take all of this into account, in 2024, the ARR for RMS, including synergies, is expected to grow at a low double-digit pace.\nNow switching gears a little bit. Last year at this time, we were just starting to mobilize around GenAI. In fact, we hadn't even deployed our internal Copilot or announced our partnership with Microsoft at that point. And it is interesting to look back because what a difference a year makes. And we now have a framework for our suite of GenAI-enabled solutions that we're rolling out during 2024. It's no longer going to be just about Research Assistant. So we've categorized our capabilities into 3 primary buckets that we call navigators, skills and assistance. And really, each of these capabilities deliver increasing levels of value to our customers and are going to have some distinct economics.\nSo navigators leverage an AI-powered natural language user interface to help our customers really get the most out of our products. And I would expect that almost all of our solutions will have some form of AI navigator or chat, what you might think of as a chatbot. And these will be table stakes, I think, for both our offerings as well as competitor offerings, I would assume in the relatively near future.\nThen we've got skills. Those are specialized GenAI capabilities that connect to Moody's data and content and analytics. And we're designing these skills to deliver automation and provide the tools to drive productivity and insight for our customers. And that includes things like the planned release of our, what we call our Quick Memo, which is our automated credit memo; and our Quick Alert, which is our surveillance and early warning system.\nAnd then we're going to have a set of assistance for a number of our major customer personas, which are going to be a combination of skills and prompt engineering that are most relevant to their jobs to be done. So this go-to-market framework, I think, is going to address the needs of our customers as they move up the spectrum of GenAI adoption in their daily work processes. And while it is still too early to quantify, we now have a pipeline that is coming to market in the coming weeks and months. And we expect that to help drive our value proposition and retention rates and open up opportunities to serve new users.\nSo on that note, I am very happy to hand it over to Noemie to provide a little more color on our results.\n\nNoemie Clemence Heuland\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ceridian HCM Holding Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Let me start by saying that in my previous role as a CFO of a public company, which was also an issuer, I've been in the building a few times over the years, but being here as Moody's CFO is both an honor and a thrill.\nAs we get to know each other, I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you my Moody's thesis that drove my decision to join. Throughout the process, everyone I met has consistently told me what an exciting time it is to join the firm. Moody's has been a trusted source of financial insights through various economic cycles, and every actor in the global capital markets benefits from the value of Moody's products and services.\nComing from the enterprise software ecosystem, I can tell you that this network effect, if you will, is one of the hardest competitive advantages to disrupt. Also in my pre-CFO role, I got the chance to interact with Moody's analysts and research teams frequently, and each time I left more impressed by the depth and rigor of their thinking. Moody's ratings is a powerful franchise with sustainable growth prospects, unparalleled reputation and an impressive industry knowledge and expertise.\nNow in addition to that, Moody's built a great set of assets based on proprietary data that goes back over 100 years. The value of that historical data is unmatched. And it is my strong belief that Moody's is well positioned to leverage GenAI capabilities as a result. Whether it's credit, KYC, climate or many other use cases, Moody's has integrated and innovated with our customers' needs at the core.\nIn truth, I spent the last 15-plus years talking to my peers about having the right data and analytics tools to make smart decisions in support of the business. And so I can attest the many use cases for Moody's Analytics solution set. As you can tell, I'm really passionate about that.\nAlso, as you would expect as a CFO, I spent some time studying Moody's financial profile before joining. From obvious attributes, this is a very profitable business, which has delivered 13% of adjusted diluted EPS growth in Q1 with a high return on tangible assets and over 100% of free cash flow to net income conversion expected this year. This is an outstanding set of fundamentals, but they are also unique in that they provide flexibility for investing and innovating to fuel growth.\nAnother CFO priority is execution of a disciplined capital allocation plan. I am very impressed with our focus and results. You saw us generate savings from resource redeployment and automation and then redirect investment spending on areas that will enable us to deliver on our medium-term targets. And we are doing that while aiming to return about 80% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks this fiscal year. In my experience, the operating leverage of this business and track record of long-term sustainable growth are simply remarkable.\nI conclude, before I get to the Q1 results and outlook, that as a CFO of a company that must abide by a large number of regulations and help its customers deal with an increased number of larger, more interconnected risks, I'm very proud to have joined the team that puts risk management at the center of what we do with resilient operations and a fantastic culture.\nI spent some time with Rob, his leadership team, the Board and many folks in finance and beyond. The culture, warmth and sharp intellect of the people at Moody's and the sense of belonging is very special. And for all these reasons, I could not think of a better place to be.\nNow turning to the first quarter results. As you heard from Rob, we started the year strong with reported revenue growth of 21% and adjusted EPS growth of 13% over the first quarter last year when, as you may recall, we saw a significant nonrecurring tax benefit. Strong growth and inherent operating leverage while making selected investments in strategic areas led to an adjusted operating margin expansion of 610 basis points at about 51%, which translated into a free cash flow conversion to GAAP net income of over 120%. Our quarterly free cash flow of close to $700 million was the highest on record.\nNow let me touch on segment results. As Rob said, the issuance rebound led to MIS delivering its second highest quarter on record. We saw a strong start across all lines of business as tightening spreads and investor demand propelled opportunistic issuance. Corporate Finance grew 49% predominantly from issuance by leveraged loan issuers and pull-forward activity. Financial institution issuance was the strongest since the financial crisis with an elevated level of infrequent issuer activity, which then led to revenue growth of 37%.\nOn the margin front, the operating leverage of our ratings business, coupled with our initiatives to drive operating efficiencies, has allowed us to capture the significant rebound in issuance and slow the upside through the bottom line with a 780 basis point expansion of adjusted operating margin year-on-year.\nTurning to Moody's Analytics. First quarter revenue was up 8%. Growth was driven by strong demand in our Data & Information line of business with revenue growing 13% year-on-year and continued demand for our KYC and compliance solutions with revenue growing 24%. As for Research & Insights, where revenue grew 3%, timing of revenue recognition of our on-premise software subscription and transaction revenue, even though these are a small share of the business of this segment, affected the growth rate a bit this quarter as well as a modest but expected uptick in CreditView attrition from banks and asset managers.\nIf you look at the revenue from hosted software solutions, though, the growth is trending closer to ARR growth. And overall, we expect Research & Insights ARR growth to tick up to the high single-digit range by year-end, particularly with pipeline momentum picking around Research Assistant and unrated coverage expansion in recent months.\nSpeaking of ARR, MA ended the first quarter with annualized recurring revenue of $3.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Of note, we saw a sequential acceleration of growth within 2 of our 3 lines of business. Decision Solutions ARR grew 12%, up from 11% in Q4 '23; and Data & Information grew 11%, up from 10%, supported by higher retention amongst banks and public sector customers. These 2 lines of business represent about 71% of total ARR, so we're really pleased to see the growth there accelerating. You heard earlier that our retention rate remains best in class at 94%, demonstrating the stickiness of our solutions.\nAs communicated in February, we are actively balancing strategic investments that we believe will drive future growth, including in our cloud platform and product road map, with operating efficiency initiatives. That said, I'm pleased to report we delivered 29.7% adjusted operating margin in Moody's Analytics segment, an increase of 80 bps year-over-year.\nLet me now turn to our assumptions around issuance that underpin our fiscal year outlook. As we said in February, our full year issuance outlook of mid- to high single-digit growth accounted for a stronger first half of the year. Indeed, first quarter issuance was strong across all business lines, but mainly from Corporate Finance and financial institutions driven by refinancing activities with a significant proportion of that activity being pull-forward.\nThat said, we are making modest revisions to select asset classes to account for what we saw in the first quarter. Specifically, we now expect big issuance to increase in the low single-digit percent range, up from approximately flat, driven by the elevated infrequent issuer activity in the first quarter that I mentioned earlier, and SFG to grow now in the high single-digit percent range as a combination of jumbo transactions and increased CLO refinancing activity fuel growth. Our guidance for [ first half ] mandates in the range of 500 to 600 remains unchanged.\nI will conclude on issuance by saying it is early in the year. And although we like what we saw in the first quarter, our broader issuance outlook for full year '24 remains largely unchanged. As such, we're maintaining our MIS revenue guidance of high single digit to low double-digit growth for the full year. Our updated outlook incorporates various specific macroeconomic assumptions, which are detailed in our presentation.\nWe are also adjusting our FX assumptions to reflect the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound. We now expect the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and the euro to GBP exchange rate to be $1.08 and $1.26, respectively, for the remainder of the year. With that background, we are making the following updates to our full year outlook.\nMoody's Analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar I just mentioned. That said, our ARR growth expectation in the low double-digit range for fiscal year '24 is unchanged from our prior guidance.\nOf note, we are maintaining our full year operating margin outlook for Moody's Analytics in the range of 30% to 31% as there is a partial FX natural hedge on our expense pool, coupled with ongoing disciplined expense management. For MIS, we just went through the issuance assumptions, and we're maintaining our full year revenue outlook of high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. And we demonstrated in Q1 that we can capture the increased volume of issuance in MIS and at the same time expand our margins, which gives us confidence to raise MIS adjusted operating margin to a range of 56% to 58%.\nLast, we told you in February that we would narrow the EPS guidance range with increased visibility, and that is precisely what we're doing. We are narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range for the year to $10.40 to $11.\nAnd that ends our prepared remarks. I'm happy to open the call to questions. Operator?"

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 as well as our outlook for full year 2024. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion & Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good morning and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. We're here from a snowy New York City. I'm going to start with some highlights from 2023 and then discuss our expectations for 2024. And and after my prepared remarks, Steve Tulenko, who's the President of Moody's Analytics; and Mike West, the President of Moody's Investor Service, will be joining me along with Caroline Sullivan, our Interim CFO, for the Q&A portion of the call.\nAnd before we get into it, I have some very exciting news. As you may have seen this morning, we announced the appointment of Noémie Heuland as our new Chief Financial Officer, and she's reporting directly to me. And Noémie brings a wealth of knowledge to Moody's after nearly 25 years in senior roles at global public companies, including most recently as CFO of Dayforce, formerly Ceridian; and over a decade with global enterprise application software provider, SAP, during which it transitioned to a global Software as a Service business model.\nSo as CFO, she's going to lead the global finance organization that includes accounting and controllership, financial planning and analysis, financial systems, investor relations, strategic sourcing and procurement and tax and treasury. And her firsthand experience in scaling high-growth, category-leading public software companies, along with her extensive global experience, I think, were the ideal CFO for Moody's as we invest in and grow our subscription-based analytics businesses and continue to expand our ratings business around the world. So it's an exciting time for Moody's, and I look forward to Noémie jumping in beginning April 1. And of course, she's going to be a regular fixture on this call going forward.\nBefore we get into the results, I also want to thank Caroline Sullivan, who is here with me for her immense contributions and support over the past few months as Moody's Interim CFO. And Caroline will remain as our Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller.\nSo with that, moving on to our results. 2023 was -- really was a defining year for us here at Moody's. We delivered 8% revenue growth. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 16%. And we were an early mover in GenAI adoption and innovation, launching our first-ever GenAI-enabled product in December. And I have to say that the energy and excitement across the organization really was palpable throughout the year as we launch new products. We entered into strategic partnerships with some of the world's leading tech companies, and we increased the gap in our Chartis RiskTech100 #1 ranking. And as we grew, we also increased our margin by over 100 basis points for the year, all while investing across the firm in technology, in products and in people.\nAnd amidst what was a pretty challenging operating environment for our financial services customers, MA delivered ARR growth of 10% with retention rates in the mid-90s. And looking at the 3 reporting lines of business in MA, that's Decision Solutions, data and information and research and insights, they delivered ARR growth of 11%, 10% and 7%, respectively. And as we have upped the product development to meet the strong market demand for tools to better manage risk and to digitize and transform workflows, for 2024, we expect MA revenue to grow to approximately 10% with ARR growth in the low double-digit percent range.\nMIS meanwhile delivered 19% growth in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Corporate finance, financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance, they all achieved double-digit revenue growth compared to 2022 on gradually improving market conditions. And I think I used the phrase fragile when describing the markets back on our third quarter earnings call, and this turned out to be true for the fourth quarter where despite a very active November, December issuance was more muted than we had expected. And we've seen a very constructive start to the year, and consequently, our revenue expectations for 2024 and are in the high single to low double-digit percent range for MIS. And I'll touch on this a bit more on the call as well as I'm sure some asset-specific issuance guidance.\nSo looking out over 2024 and beyond, we're really excited about the great momentum in the business and the tremendous growth potential that we've got in front of us. And to capitalize on these opportunities, we're accelerating and increasing the level of organic investment this year in 3 critical areas: that's GenAI, new product development, and platforming and technology. And this is a deliberate investment program to fully capture the power of AI across our business, to expand the reach and connectedness of MA solutions and accelerate the technology enablement of the ratings agency, all to deliver on our ambitious medium-term targets.\nNow our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, invest in our business whenever we see great opportunities, and we are, in fact, doing that; and second, return capital to stockholders. And this year, we expect to nearly double the amount of capital we return to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAnd that brings me to our EPS guidance. We're anticipating adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.25 to $11 for 2024. This incorporates a little bit wider range at the beginning of the year to capture some of the uncertainty around issuance, and we would expect this to narrow during the course of the year. And of note, as you compare 2024 EPS guidance to 2023, you might remember we had some outsized tax benefits in the first half of last year that resulted in a 2023 effective tax rate of 16.9%. And for 2024, we're expecting the rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%.\nAnd if you look through the 2023 benefit at the midpoint of our 2024 range, our 2024 adjusted EPS represents 24% growth rate since 2022, and that's in line with the low double-digit percentage growth that we've targeted over the medium term.\nNow looking at 2023, I want to take a moment to touch on a few data points that highlight what a powerful franchise we have and also put our 2023 accomplishments into some perspective, amidst, as I said, what was a very challenging operating environment for many of our customers last year. And despite relatively modest MIS-rated issuance growth of about 5%, we generated approximately $450 million in incremental revenue growth across our entire company. And today, we have a base of recurring revenue of over $4 billion, while our more transactional-oriented revenue model across a $74 trillion universe of rated debt gives us upside as debt velocity improves. And together, this underpins our confidence in accelerating our revenue growth to the high single to low double-digit percent range in 2024.\nAnd over the years, we have really built a customer base that's almost like no other company with 97% the Fortune 100 and 87% of the Forbes 1000 being a Moody's customer today. And the world's leading companies turn to us, they trust our market-leading solutions, and that gives us a tremendous base to sell into. This shows up in the many external accolades and awards that we've received. We had over 150 last year alone. And I want to give a special shout-out to our MIS team as we were awarded Best Credit Rating Agency for the 12th year in a row by Institutional Investor. That is great stuff.\nI think we all understand our market-leading position in ratings, but we've also built a market-leading position with our MA business. And for the second year in a row, we were ranked #1 in the Chartis RiskTech100. And that was supported by category wins in strategy, banking and insurance and a number of solutions categories ranging from climate risk to credit risk to financial crime data and a number more. And understanding the critical importance of attracting and retaining the best talent in this environment, we continue to lean into our culture to make this the kind of place where the brightest minds want to build their careers and help our customers address some of the world's great challenges.\nSo to sustain our growth, you frequently hear about the investments that we make in our solutions to help our customer make better, more informed decisions about risk. And we achieved a number of important milestones in 2023, too many to get into on this call, but I am going to focus on just a few of the highlights.\nIn ratings, we continue to expand the markets we serve through Moody's Local. We also developed dedicated teams in digital finance and private credit so that we're at the forefront of opportunities in the global debt markets. In private credit specifically, we're coordinating across our ratings franchise so that we have the engagement, the methodologies and the analytical and commercial resources to be the agency of choice for players in this market, ranging from BDCs to alternative asset managers, insurance companies and debt funds.\nTo further address the private credit opportunity, we added more than 12,000 unrated entities to our CreditView research service in November. That triples the breadth of our coverage and provides a new runway for growth for our research business.\nAnother growth opportunity in our research and insights business that many of you have heard about is our Research Assistant product. That's our first GenAI product that we launched commercially on December 1. And it's the first of GenAI-enabled tools that we're developing, and we're excited about the initial customer feedback and early traction with this product. And I'm sure we're going to touch on this a bit more in the Q&A.\nWe also continue to enhance and expand our massive company database in important ways to create valuable early warning signals for our customers and address the increasing demand for third-party risk management. And there were really 3 elements to that in 2003 that I'll call out: first was integrating our predictive analytic tools and credit scores on over 450 million companies into Orbis; the second was expanding our coverage of over 1 million AI-curated and scored new stories a day that are available on companies in Orbis; and third, leveraging our investment in BitSight. Over the course of 2023, we integrated over 6 million cyber scores into Orbis, and that number continues to grow.\nAcross Decision Solutions, we developed new solutions and integrated more data sets to expand the utility of our offerings. And in KYC, our new entity verification tool, combines real-time registry content with our Orbis data to help our customers identify risky shell companies and minimize the potential for fraud and sanctions risk. With the launch of our most recent Sanctions360 tool, we're the only one in the market who can look through multiple complex layers of corporate hierarchies and ownership structures to identify potential sanctions breaches.\nIn banking, we integrated climate analytics into a broad range of workflow solutions from loan origination to portfolio management to stress testing. And in insurance, in just a year, we more than doubled the number of customers using a cloud-based Intelligent Risk Platform. That's a versatile, cloud-based risk analytics platform that enables customers to analyze hundreds of millions of commercial and residential locations. It's not just being used by insurers. We're attracting a diverse set of customers who have a tangible and growing need for our more sophisticated climate data and analytics.\nI have to say, I'm proud to report that at the end of January, we signed one of the world's largest banks as a new customer of our climate and catastrophe modeling solutions to support the in-depth climate analysis for required regulatory disclosures and stress testing.\nAnd underpinning all of this is our ongoing foundational investments in the business, and these investments will enhance our ability to integrate our data estate across all of our customer use cases more efficiently and more effectively.\nSo I hope as you get a sense, there are a lot of exciting things that are happening here at Moody's. And as I take a step back to consider the many opportunities for growth ahead, I really am energized by all that's in front of us. And there are 3 things that we are doing to really drive future growth: that is land new customers, expand customer relationships and then innovate continuously to deliver more value.\nAnd I just touched on the breadth and quality of our existing customer relationships. We've got a fantastic customer base, especially in financial services, where we've been developing relationships for literally decades, landing new customers, expanding relationships and innovating with a proven track record of growth. And in recent years, we've been successful in growing these relationships further and diversifying into new areas like KYC and supplier risk management.\nIn fact, our net expansion rate in the financial services sector stands at a healthy 109%. And I think that's a pretty clear indication of our ability to deepen relationships and deliver value. And now leveraging GenAI and our broader content sets and capabilities, expanding and deepening these relationships will continue to be a significant opportunity for us.\nNow building on these successes, we've got a great opportunity to expand in new customer segments, supporting new use cases. While financial institutions account for about 70% of ARR in MA, there's been very good demand coming from newer relationships beyond the financial services segment, 14% new sales compound annual growth rate over the last 2 years in these sectors. That's the corporate and public sector. And over that period, we've established significant relationships with major companies in the United States and Europe who are leveraging our expertise for customer and supplier risk assessment.\nOur ratings business also has some opportunities to serve existing and new customers. I think those as kind of the markets of tomorrow. We've expanded our footprint in domestic and emerging debt market, where the growth is faster than it is in more developed debt markets. And interesting data point, the Moody's Local initiative in Latin America, which you've heard me talk about, it's a great example of doing that, where organic revenue grew 22% in 2023.\nSo these land-and-expand opportunities are supported by major secular trends that are driving demand for our offerings. And I would cite a few of those. We're poised to capitalize on the content unlock opportunity from GenAI enablement and innovation, the widespread digitization and transformation programs across banks and insurers, the growing demand for third-party risk management solutions and the ongoing growth of the private credit sector. And with our wide-ranging capabilities that we've put together to deliver this holistic view of risk, I think we are uniquely well positioned at the intersection of these trends.\nSo I can assure you that we reflected a lot on these opportunities as we entered our annual operating plan cycle this fall. And not dissimilar to past years, we were challenged to prioritize and balance organic investments with operational efficiency and productivity initiatives.\nOn the efficiency side, we expect to generate savings from resource redeployment, alternative staffing models, automation and GenAI enablement and geolocation strategies. And we're prioritizing investment spending on areas that are enabling us to deliver at our current growth rates, including SaaS-based product development, sales deployment, operational resiliency and ratings workflows. And these initiatives are really funded within our -- what we think of as our regular pace of operating margin expansion.\nBut as we exited the unit around GenAI innovation last year, we reflected on the opportunities ahead of us. We considered the deep customer relationships that I've just touched on, our unique data assets that you hear us talk about, the market trends that I just mentioned, together with our growth strategy, and we proactively upped the organic investments that we started in the summer of last year. And we are increasing our budgeted operating expenses for 2024 by an additional $60 million in 3 primary investment areas.\nFirst, and I'm sure this isn't particularly surprising is GenAI. We're increasing product-related investments across MA that will continue to build on our early-mover momentum from 2023 and investments across the company and initiatives to accelerate employee adoption and improve productivity.\nOn the product side, we have a few really interesting things that are moving ahead fairly quickly. So CreditLens, which is our flagship banking nation solution, will be the next to launch a GenAI-enabled capability to generate a credit memo within seconds, leveraging the digitized information about borrowers and their credit facilities that is stored natively in our software. And we're going to be saving loan officers and credit professionals countless hours compiling information and generating the first draft of the documents that are produced with virtually every commercial loan. We've got our first beta customer already, and we are currently in preview with a number of other customers.\nI'm also very encouraged by our new GenAI-enabled commercial real estate early warning system that we believe will significantly enhance commercial real estate portfolio monitoring capabilities for both lenders and investors. And I actually just sat through a demo of this in the last week or 2. And the early warning system integrates a wide range of our data sets. It enables the evaluation of news events in real time, running scenarios and calculations that link together market forecasts, listings and property data, tenant data and valuation and credit models. And again, the early feedback has been very positive, and we're already looking to extend these capabilities beyond just commercial real estate.\nNow from an internal perspective, we've rolled out GitHub CoPilot and some other GenAI tools to more than 1,500 engineering professionals across the company. And as a result of our experience last year, we've specifically planned for efficiency gains in our engineering budgets in 2024. We're also rolling out our next generation of AI-enabled tools for our sales teams across the company over the next several months. So that's the first area.\nThe second area is product development. And as part of our land-and-expand strategy in MA, we are building on the success and momentum of our KYC business, which has grown to over $300 million of ARR in just a few years. And I think those of you who've been on this call for a while, you've heard me mention before that our -- that Know Your Customer is probably too limiting of a term for this business as it continues to expand. So this year, we're increasing investments to develop solutions focused on the growing market demand really for solutions to serve their customer and supplier risk needs. And we're especially encouraged by recent wins with a number of large government and Fortune 100 customers. So this year, we're going to make investments in product, technology and data and go-to-market capabilities to be able to scale in these customer segments.\nThe ratings ecosystem also continues to evolve. In early January, we were just provided with the very first -- we just had the very first rating on a tokenized bond fund. And while digitized -- or sorry, digital finance is still nascent, we're going to be ready to help our customers delivering our ratings on the platforms wherever they are going to issue. So that's second.\nAnd then third is around technology platforming. So we're building on the platforming work that we highlighted in our Innovation Open House event back in September. And as we explained then, this work is critical to strengthening the interoperability of all of our data estate and improving the synergies across our solutions. By investing in our platforming and engineering capabilities, we're going to accelerate our time to market, enhance the customer experience, better enable cross-sell and upsell and deliver engineering efficiencies. The faster this work gets done, the sooner we will realize the revenue and efficiency benefits, so we have decided to hit the accelerator.\nThe same is true in ratings, where more tech-enabled workflow is really key to the quality, speed, efficiency and compliance. And we've been on a journey to modernize, digitize and automate our systems. We've made some good headway, but there is still more work to be done. Optimizing our data estate and moving more of our workflow into cloud-based applications really has never been more important given the promise of AI and the digitization of financial markets. So here, too, we decided to accelerate our efforts, and this will be critical in achieving our medium-term margin targets.\nSo now let me turn to our issuance outlook very briefly. We're expecting more constructive market conditions in 2024. And I'm sure, as you have all seen, it was a very busy start to the year, over $150 billion in investment-grade issuance in January alone. Underpinning our MIS revenue growth outlook of high single to low double digits is an increase in MIS-rated issuance in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. For corporates, we expect that leverage finance will grow faster than investment-grade issuance, which should be favorable to revenue mix. And our outlook is built on the macroeconomic assumptions that are detailed on Page 20 of our webcast deck and notably incorporating a soft landing here in the U.S. and rate cuts starting in the second quarter of this year. And I imagine we'll dive deeper into both our issuance and macroeconomic assumptions in the Q&A session.\nBefore moving off of MIS, I do want to highlight that early last year, we committed to reviewing our medium-term guidance for MIS revenue growth once we saw a sustainable improvement in the debt markets. And I'm happy to share that following 6% revenue growth in 2023 and the expectation of at least high single-digit growth in 2024, we have updated our medium-term growth target for MIS -- revenue growth target for MIS to be in the mid- to high single-digit percent growth range.\nNow moving back to our 2024 annual guidance. Moody's revenue is expected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. The Moody's adjusted operating margin is projected to be in the range of 44% to 46%. That's about 100 basis points of margin improvement at the midpoint. And the Moody's revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance ranges incorporate the variability of that MIS transaction-based revenue and then balanced against the subscription base in MA, where nearly 95% of our revenues are recurring.\nIn regards to M&A, we're guiding to a tighter range of approximately 10% growth -- revenue growth and low double-digit growth in ARR. Now MA's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31% this year. That's absorbing the impact of the incremental organic investments that I just talked about. In the medium term, we expect MA's adjusted operating margin to be in the mid-30s percent range. And as I have discussed with a number of you, the path to that target is not exactly linear.\nFor 2024, MIS' adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 55.5% to 57.5%. That is a 200 basis point improvement versus 2023 at the midpoint, and that is solidly on towards the medium-term target of low 60s percent.\nOur expenses overall are expected to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. A couple of factors worth noting, first, we closed out our 202223 geolocation restructuring program at the end of 2023. Caroline can talk more about that. Second, we expect depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $450 million in 2024. That's an increase of approximately 20% as compared to 2023. And that growth is largely related to the cumulative effect of our shift towards developing exclusively SaaS-based and starting back in 2021 and coupled with the increased capital expenditures associated with the 3 primary areas of incremental organic investment that I just talked about. And we're expecting free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range I said earlier of $10.25 to $11, again, a 24% increase at the midpoint versus 2022, looking through those tax benefits that I touched on.\nSo I'll wrap up by just saying it was a really great year for us here in 2023. I'm expecting an even more exciting one ahead. I'm energized by our strategy. We've got fantastic engagement across the company. And we believe that now is the time to invest in the opportunity that's in front of us to fully embrace the power of AI across our business, to accelerate the build-out of our technology platform and to bring together our content to build new solutions with unique value propositions that will accelerate growth.\nSo with that, I welcome Caroline, Steve and Mike to join me for Q&A. And operator, please open the call up to questions."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the third quarter of 2023 as well as our revised outlook for select metrics for full year 2023. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those company such forward-looking statements.\nI'd also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode.\nRob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our results, key business highlights and outlook. After which, he'll be joined by Caroline Sullivan, Moody's Interim Chief Financial Officer, to answer your questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good morning and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. I'm excited to share our financial results as well as some key business highlights, and that's going to include some notable innovations and investments, progress on our GenAI strategy and a spotlight on our fastest-growing business in MA, that is our know-your-customer business or KYC as we commonly refer to it.\nAnd before I get started, I just want to say how proud I am that Moody's has again finished #1 in the Chartis RiskTech100. That is the most comprehensive global ranking of risk and compliance technology providers, and it is a great recognition of the breadth and depth of solutions based on both market research and customer feedback.\nI also want to take a moment to recognize the incredible resilience and dedication of our people. And I've really appreciated how our people have come together recently for each other and to continue to deliver for our customers.\nSo as you all will have seen from this morning's earnings release, we reported 15% overall revenue growth with strong top line performance and improved adjusted operating margins from each of our businesses, and that contributed to a 31% increase in adjusted diluted EPS in the third quarter. MA revenue grew 13% while achieving its fourth consecutive quarter of 10% ARR growth, and MA's growth continues to be led by our KYC business. We now have over $300 million of annualized recurring revenue or ARR, and that's growing at 18%. MA also produced an adjusted operating margin of 33.6%.\nNow MIS grew 18% in the quarter as the leveraged finance issuance markets continued to improve from last year's subdued levels, I would call it. And MIS revenue is now expected to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range for the full year, and that acknowledges the current uncertainties in the capital markets.\nLast week, we published our annual refinancing wall study. And that showed a 21% increase in the total U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt coming due over the next 5 years. And as I've mentioned on prior calls, these refi walls are a very important component of our long-term growth algorithm, and that remains firmly intact.\nAnd as those of you who attended our innovation open house last month would have heard, we're moving quickly to integrate our broad data and analytic capabilities across our product suite and to leverage the power of GenAI to develop new and cutting-edge solutions to empower both our customers and our employees.\nAnd the pace of innovation is clearly accelerating across our businesses. We're investing, we're launching new products, entering into strategic partnerships, all that will enable us to continue delivering market-leading growth. And if you look just at the third quarter, we announced some really interesting things. And I want to take you through a few of those, and I'm going to start with ratings.\nWe've talked about on prior calls about how deepening our participation in developing capital markets and in particular, domestic issuance markets is important to that long-term growth algorithm that I just mentioned. And that includes Latin America, where Moody's Local has grown its customer count by more than 20% this year. And the Asia Pacific region also has some exciting opportunities, which is why in September, we further extended our domestic ratings business with the opening of VIS rating in Vietnam, and that is a small but fast-growing domestic bond market.\nI also talk about how the relevance and importance of our voice in the markets is a really critical part of what makes MIS the agency of choice for both issuers and investors. And last month, we published really a groundbreaking cross-industry report on some risks and practices, and it leveraged our relationship with BitSight. And we had nearly 2,000 companies that provided data and inputs, and we were able to highlight the more than $20 trillion of rated debt that is at high risk from cyber threats. And that is, I think, a really great example of the importance of a multidimensional view of risk, in this case, understanding how cyber risks are impacting credit risks.\nNow moving to MA. We're launching our first GenAI-enabled product. We call it Research Assistant, and we've already previewed it with over 150 customers. Our strategy is to commercialize the launch as we head into the year-end renewal cycle. And initially, our thinking is that Research Assistant will be sold as an add-on to our flagship product, which is CreditView. And leveraging the power of an LLM with Moody's trusted proprietary content allows customers to generate rich credit insights in just seconds and with capabilities in multiple languages.\nWe also expanded our coverage in CreditView to now include 12,000 new unrated names, and that allows us to better serve the private credit market. And customers who purchase that module are going to have a seamless, integrated experience that includes financials, ownership structures, credit scores, sector research, interactive scorecards and peer analysis. And I think that is a great example of content integration to serve new customers and new use cases.\nWe're also constantly investing in our data estate that includes Orbis, which is one of the world's largest databases on companies. And we've expanded again our partnership with BitSight by integrating their cyber data and scores for about 250,000 entities into Orbis, and that enables our customers to better understand cyber risk.\nWe also have several exciting product launches across Decision Solutions. So in banking, we launched a new module in CreditLens that will integrate a bank's own loan-level data with Moody's content. And this portfolio module really provides a dynamic view of a bank's loan portfolio by monitoring and measuring performance and providing early warning signals.\nWe're also integrating RMS' physical and transition risk models with our proprietary ESG and climate data into a range of banking solutions. And that is empowering our customers to make better, more informed decisions around lending, portfolio management, stress testing and regulatory reporting. And these are some of the original synergies that we envisioned with the RMS acquisition. So it's great to see this in practice.\nAnd speaking of RMS, I was in Europe last month at a major insurance industry gathering with a bunch of CEOs and Chief Risk Officers. And I again came away very excited about what we're doing with the industry. Together with BitSight, we recently launched the Moody's RMS cyber industry steering group with 2 major market players, Munich Re and Gallagher. And we're also partnering with Lloyd's of London to develop a carbon emissions accounting platform for their ecosystem.\nNow in addition to these recent product launches and initiatives, we're continuing to leverage GenAI across our organization. And as you heard at our innovation open house last month, our colleagues are taking a really active and hands-on approach in innovating and driving change. In fact, over 70% of our people have used our in-house Copilot tool. And that includes for things like coding, preparing a report or improving an internal process.\nAnd this adoption is also reinforcing our early-mover advantage as we're now benefiting from an internal feedback loop, and that's allowing us to share learnings from our own GenAI journey with our customers. And speaking of customers, we've been engaging extensively with customers around our GenAI strategy, including the relevance of our curated and proprietary data and research and our approach to data integrity and security. And in particular, since July, we've demoed our Research Assistant, as I said, with a number of our customers and nearly every one of these customers believes that this product will have meaningful benefits for both their productivity and their insight.\nWe're also revving up the work that we've been doing as part of our partnership with Microsoft and leveraging their secure Azure OpenAI service. We're building new functionality and content sets and entitlement capabilities into Research Assistant. We're also continuing to expand the ways that we leverage Microsoft Teams to collaborate internally.\nAnd I think importantly, we're seeking to expand our joint go-to-market opportunities, broadening the appeal of this partnership to new customers and market segments. And that includes creating Teams plug-ins that will be available to Microsoft's 300 million monthly users and infusing Moody's content into their Dynamics and Power Platforms to enable CRM and workflow integrations. We're also continuing to explore migrating our content set to Microsoft Fabric to enable entitlement and delivery of content and insights to our shared customers. So really taken together, I'd say we're very energized by the progress we've made, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\nIn addition to Microsoft, we're working closely with other leading cloud and software players, leveraging our respective strengths to deliver new and innovative GenAI solutions. And partnerships can take many forms. It can include joint product development, joint go-to-market activities or direct commercial opportunities. And to help maximize this opportunity, we've developed a strategy and a framework and a team for third-party partnerships.\nI think a good example of this is the work we announced earlier this week with Google. And through this partnership, Moody's and Google Cloud are going to explore creating LLMs and AI applications specifically to help financial professionals perform faster and deeper analysis of financial reports and disclosures and other materials. So we're certainly excited to be at the cutting edge of GenAI innovation with some leading partners.\nIn recent quarters, we've been spotlighting 1 of the 3 cloud-based SaaS businesses within Decision Solutions. And so I want to cap off that series, if you will, with KYC. And unlike banking and insurance, which are obviously industry-specific, KYC is relevant to all of our customer base. And as I said before, a really important objective for many of our customers is to have a better understanding of who they are doing business with, whether it's making a loan, underwriting an insurance policy, onboarding a customer or monitoring a supplier.\nAnd over the years, we have tried to be very thoughtful about how we have added to our capabilities to build a business that, as I said earlier, is generating over $300 million in ARR and growing at 18%. And 2 significant acquisitions that some of you asked about from time to time, and that's BvD and RDC, really foundational elements of our KYC solutions, and they have both outperformed their original acquisition targets.\nAnd there are several thematic drivers behind the growth of the KYC business. Specifically, I would call out the digitization and automation of what are very manual and expensive in-house compliance processes, the growth in online transactions and payments, and also the need for greater breadth and precision amidst new and increasing regulations. And all of this combines with the need for better analytics and insights, again, not just about customers, but more broadly, who companies are doing business with.\nSo by combining our proprietary data on companies and people with analytics and through a modern cloud-based SaaS platform, we're delivering solutions for our customers in some pretty compelling ways. And these solutions use traditional AI. You've heard us talk about that on this call before that includes machine learning, natural language processing and integrating data on over 470 million public and private companies with more than 1.7 billion ownership links, profiles on over 20 million politically exposed people and sanctions in adverse media. And recently, based on customer feedback, we've also added an ESG scores and credit scores.\nSo we offer access to our KYC tools and content in several different ways, and that includes via data feeds or APIs into customers' in-house systems. It also includes full end-to-end workflow with proprietary and third-party data that supports customer acquisition and onboarding, screening, monitoring and third-party risk management processes.\nAnd the front-end workflow software is what we acquired when we bought PassFort Pack in 2021. So that moved us from being just a data provider to being a full-service provider in this space. And that combination is increasingly being recognized across the industry, including the recent Chartis awards, as the only vendor that's identified as a market leader for both data and workflow.\nWe're also seeing significant growth outside of the financial sector, and we are investing to enhance the relevance of our offerings in the corporate and government space. That includes our recent launch of something called Sanction 360. That enables customers to efficiently and effectively comply with regulatory requirements regarding their customers, counterparties and suppliers by better understanding the implications of both sanctions and sanctions by extension. And our ability to build solutions that reach a broad set of customers is really a key element of our land-and-expand strategy. In fact, approximately 25% of MA's overall new customer ARR growth in the last year came from KYC. And generating these new relationships then provides additional opportunities for us to cross-sell from other parts of MA.\nLikewise, our existing customer base also provides some very significant runway for future growth. Currently, only about 20% or about 3,000 of MA's customers buy one of our KYC solutions, and that represents an important cross-sell opportunity for our remaining 13,000-or-so customers.\nNow turning to MIS. In the third quarter, issuance was consistent with normal seasonal patterns. I'd say that activity was relatively subdued in July and August, and we certainly saw some stronger volumes in September. Growth was driven by leveraged finance on the back of what was the strongest leveraged loan volume since the first quarter of 2022. And that, coupled with elevated activity from infrequent banking issuers and an improvement in project and public finance issuance versus the prior year, all of that contributed to a favorable mix.\nAs a result, while global issuance was up about 12%, MIS transactional revenue was up 31% versus last year. And together with 5% recurring revenue growth, MIS revenue grew 18% for the quarter. And as we head into the fourth quarter, I'd say that general market sentiment remains a bit fragile. We've updated our guidance to reflect an expectation of modestly lower issuance volumes in the fourth quarter, particularly in investment-grade and structured finance, than we had been anticipating back in July. And the heightened geopolitical turmoil, combined with macroeconomic concerns around a higher-for-longer interest rate environment, they continue to drive some volatility and uncertainty around yields and spreads.\nAnd these conditions are likely to be particularly impactful on opportunistic investment-grade issuers. And that's a reason that we're lowering the outlook for investment-grade issuance to approximately 25% growth for the full year 2023.\nWe also continue to see the knock-on impacts of lower asset generation on the structured finance sector, and so we're updating our outlook to decline by around 25% compared to the prior year. So these 2 forecast updates result in an overall revision to our expectation for issuance for the year, and we now expect issuance to -- growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range in 2023 and MIS to grow in the mid- to high single-digit range.\nSo while there are some headwinds to accelerating issuance growth in the near term, refunding walls continue to grow, and they are a key factor supporting medium-term issuance growth. And our annual study on refinancing, which we, as I mentioned, just recently published, captures nonfinancial corporate maturities in both the U.S. and EMEA. And we look at the next 4 years as an aggregate figure. And with approximately $4.4 trillion coming due in the next 4 years, that's up by about 10% versus last year's study. And you can see that, I believe, in the appendix in our supplemental materials.\nI also want to spotlight the U.S. in particular. Obviously, this is the largest of all the global bond markets. And looking out over 5 years, and that's the length of the U.S. study, the aggregate forward maturity wall grew by about 21% compared to the study -- last year's study. And the main contributor to this is leveraged finance, which grew approximately 27%. So that's certainly going to be helpful to future mix over the coming years.\nSo forward maturities continue to provide support for future issuance and continue to be an important part of the MIS long-term growth algorithm. And I would also say that overall corporate debt velocity, which is total corporate issuance as a percent of total corporate debt outstanding, remains pretty far below historical averages. So that implies the potential for pent-up issuance demand in the future.\nSo on that note, I'm going to pause here, and I'm happy to open the call for questions. Operator?"

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2023 as well as our revised outlook for select metrics for full year 2023. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we'll also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found toward the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. Rob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our results, key business highlights and outlook, after which he'll be joined by Mark Kaye, Moody's Chief Financial Officer, to answer your questions. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident-Moody’s Investors Service, Moody's Corp.\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. As we typically do, I'm going to touch on a few key takeaways from our second quarter results and provide some insights into what's supporting our growth outlook. I also want to continue to highlight some of the exciting growth opportunities within the Decision Solutions line of business. And this quarter, I'm going to spotlight our insurance business. Then I'm going to talk about how we are positioning ourselves for what I tend to think of as a generational opportunity provided by generative AI. And as always, Mark and I will be happy to take your questions.\nWe delivered strong performance across the firm this quarter. MIS achieved its first quarter of revenue growth in 6 quarters amidst a steady improvement in issuance. In fact, revenue growth -- revenue grew 6%, outpacing a 3% increase in issuance. And the improvement in the issuance environment was led by a 54% increase in activity. And this, combined with the ongoing gradual recovery in high-yield bonds has led us to raise MIS' revenue guidance for the full year to high single-digit growth, up from our prior guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth.\nWe continue to sustain 10% ARR growth in MA and selling into strong demand for our suite of mission-critical data analytics and workflow tools. And this quarter, we're introducing some additional top line disclosures for our banking, insurance and KYC businesses so that we can provide you with more insight into the robust performance of Decision Solutions. The stronger-than-expected revenue growth in MIS is driving the increase in our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $9.75 to $10.25. And we continue to balance our expense control measures while furthering our investment in the business. We're capitalizing on our unique ability to integrate proprietary data sets and advanced capabilities from across our businesses into tailored cloud-based solutions.\nAnd we're innovating and investing extensively across the company to build further on this momentum with several key initiatives focused around generative AI technology turbocharged by our recent partnership with Microsoft. And over the past several months, as our businesses continue to scale, we spent considerable time talking with investors about how to think about the Moody's of today. And I want to share that with you because I think it's really useful context for understanding both our performance and our growth opportunity.\nAnd we've got several great crown jewel businesses, and anchoring those businesses, of course, is MIS, the global agency of choice for issuers and investors. But in MA, we have one of the world's premier subscription-based fixed income and economics research businesses, a data business powered by what we believe is the world's largest database on companies and credit and 3 cloud-based SaaS businesses serving banking, insurance and KYC workflows.\nAnd at a high level, these businesses come together to help banks, insurers, corporates and public sector entities really do 1 of 3 things: first, to help them commence a relationship or an exposure so to issue, originate, select or underwrite; second, during the life of that relationship, help them measure, monitor and manage risk; and third, on the back end, help them verify, account, comply, plan and report. And to do this, we leverage a tremendous set of proprietary data analytics and domain expertise across a range of areas: credit, companies, properties, securities, people, economies, ESG, climate and more. And we think of that as our risk operating system, and we thread that content through our solutions, and that's what makes our customer value proposition both sticky and differentiated.\nSo with that backdrop, let me touch on MIS for the quarter. So the headwinds of the first quarter have largely dissipated, and that has led to more constructive market conditions and a surge in investment-grade issuance. In fact, May was one of the busiest months on record for investment-grade activity as both corporate and infrastructure issuers came to the market opportunistically. And I've said previously that investment-grade activity opens the door for issuance further down the rating scale, and that's exactly what we've seen with the ongoing recovery in high-yield bonds. And we saw the strongest issuance quarter since the beginning of 2022 in high yield, and that drove an almost 50% increase in our high-yield revenue versus the prior year period.\nAnd so primarily based on the stronger-than-expected performance in both investment-grade and high yield, we're raising our issuance and revenue guidance for MIS for the full year. And so the backdrop to the market recovery, I would say, still remains fragile. And of our first-time mandates signed in the second quarter, only 25% or so have issued as some of those corporate treasurers and CFOs wait on the sidelines for more market certainty around the path of inflation and rates and the economy. And so muted M&A activity is also contributing to a limited supply of leveraged loans, and that has negatively impacted CLO creation since over 60% of these loans typically go on to be securitized.\nWithin other structured finance asset classes such as CMBS and RMBS, higher all-in funding costs are restricting asset creation, and that's resulting in fewer deals and leading us to take down our structured finance issuance forecast for the year. And while we've had softer issuance markets over the past year, we've been strengthening our position in the markets of the future to reinforce MIS' position as the agency of choice. We have strategically invested in our emerging markets footprint for many years, and you've heard us talk about this at investor days and on earnings calls.\nAnd that's because, although emerging markets account for something like 50% of of global GDP, they represent less than 10% of cross-border issuance. So we recognize this opportunity for long-term growth. And our investment includes thought leadership like our Annual Emerging Markets Summit that we held in the second quarter. We attracted participants from over 90 countries to that conference. And in the second quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of SCRiesgo, a domestic credit rating agency serving Central America, further strengthening our growing Moody's local franchise all across Latin America.\nAnd as the digitization of financial markets accelerates, we're positioning MIS as a leader in assessing a decentralized finance, digital bonds and asset tokenization. We've rated a number of firsts in this space, and that includes just this month, the European Investment Bank's first ever digital green bond. And of course, we continue to grow our sustainable finance franchise within MIS with good momentum in second-party opinions. You may recall, we relaunched our methodology in the fourth quarter of 2022. We have now completed over 90 second-party opinions through the first half of this year, and that includes for marquee issuers like Enel and the government of Mexico. And we have delivered 36% growth in the SPO volumes versus the same prior year period.\nNow moving to MA. Just a few minutes ago, I described Decision Solutions as primarily 3 cloud-based SaaS businesses serving banking, insurance and KYC workflows. And as these businesses scale, we want to offer some additional insights into their performance. So from this quarter onwards, we're going to be providing revenue and ARR metrics for each of them. And as you can see here, each of these businesses achieved double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter. And together, they delivered 10% ARR growth with KYC leading the way at nearly 20% ARR growth.\nSo last quarter, we provided a spotlight on our banking business within Decision Solutions. And I thought this quarter that I would touch on our insurance business. We got some good feedback from that spotlight last quarter. And our insurance business brings together the legacy MA insurance business, which mainly serves life insurers with RMS, which caters primarily the P&C market. And collectively, our insurance business delivers workflow solutions for underwriting, risk and capital management and financial and regulatory reporting, and it generates in the neighborhood of $500 million of ARR. So it makes it a very significant component of the broader MA portfolio.\nAnd like banks, insurers are undergoing a significant period of transformation as they work to digitize and automate manual and fragmented workflows in order to be both more effective and more efficient in underwriting, in risk management and capital planning. And this opens new opportunities for us to establish and expand our presence, offering new solutions and capabilities much in the same way that we have successfully done with banks.\nAnd at the heart of our insurance offerings are our AXIS and RMS risk engines. And AXIS provides the core actuarial and finance cash flow modeling that is widely used by life insurers, reinsurers and consulting firms for functions that include pricing, reserving, asset liability management, financial modeling, capital calculations and hedging. And AXIS has proven to be a significant catalyst for growth and this quarter was no exception. This quarter, growth was fueled by increasing demand for our fully automated service, which enables insurers to send their actuarial modeling jobs to a cloud-based infrastructure for very efficient processing.\nAnd also contributing to growth in the second quarter is our risk integrity offering, which seamlessly integrates with access and provides a highly automated solution for calculating financial statement information in compliance with IFRS 17 regulations.\nNow on the property and casualty side, in May, we held our most successful global insurance conference ever called Exceedance. I was there with about 500 of our customers from around the world. And we made several very important new product announcements. And I have to say I love the conference, feeling very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us to serve the insurance industry. So first, our cloud-based, what we call Intelligent Risk Platform or IRP. That is industrial strength and it is differentiated in the market. We now have well north of 100 customers on the Intelligent Risk Platform in the cloud.\nAnd this allows customers to run our new more granular, what we call high definition models by leveraging cloud computing power on demand. And that gives our customers a competitive advantage for those of our customers who are using this cloud solution. We also announced that we're partnering with NASDAQ, enabling our customers to seamlessly access a wide array of cat models available on the NASDAQ platform in addition to our customers' own internal models. And this collaboration significantly enhances the value and capabilities of our IRP as a broader industry workflow platform.\nSo with this very compelling set of capabilities and solutions across insurance, now let me talk a little bit about the customer expansion opportunity. And we have over 900 insurance customers globally, and there is a significant opportunity for cross-selling and growing revenue per customer. We have very substantial relationships with our top 10 largest insurance customers who purchase on average about 6 to 7 product families from across all of MA. Our next 90 largest insurers purchase, on average, about 4 to 5 product families, and our remaining 800 customers buy an average of just 1 to 2 products. So you can really see the extent of the cross-sell opportunity.\nAnd let me give you an example of how we are growing our insurance relationships. So 5 years ago, one of the larger U.S. insurers were spending about $15 million annually with us across products, spanning risk and capital management, finance and reporting workflow tools and also some other products, including our MIS data feeds for risk management functions like risk-adjusted capital calculations and portfolio construction. After the acquisition of RMS, this customer relationship grew substantially to north of $25 million. And this insurer is now a significant customer of both AXIS and RMS. And given the breadth of business activities of a large insurer, and that includes lending and investing in addition to underwriting, they also subscribed to a number of our other solutions like our CreditLens loan origination, our CreditView research platform and our structured finance and commercial real estate data and analytics and even our KYC tools. And that has altogether allowed us to expand the relationship to an ARR of over $30 million.\nAnd KYC offers another compelling cross-sell opportunity with insurers as well as corporates. And in fact, in 2021, less than 10% of our insurance customers subscribed to a KYC product. Just 2 years later, we're up to about 20% and we are optimistic about further potential here. So our ability to deliver unique and innovative solutions is also being recognized across the industry. And of the awards that are listed on this slide, I have to say I'm particularly proud of our recent recognition as the overall winner of Chartis' inaugural Insurance 25 Award because it highlights our innovative market-leading solutions that span climate, cat risk modeling and economic and financial analysis.\nAnd speaking of innovation, as you hopefully heard during our recent gen AI briefing, artificial intelligence is fundamental to many of our products, and frankly, it has been for years. I want to touch on 3 of those. And I'd start with QUIQspread, which is an AI machine learning tool that we have developed in-house that digitizes and spreads financial data. And it's been integrated into a number of our products, including our CreditLens loan origination offering. And today, it's used by hundreds of customers, including banks around the world.\nOur AI review product is really at the heart of our KYC screening solutions. It's been trained on over 12 million actual KYC analyst decisions and it's currently used by over 500 customers. And so far this year, it's processed over 110 million names. And this all helps further train the artificial intelligence engine that powers these insights, and it reduces the likelihood of false positives by up to 80%. And that eliminates countless hours of manual work and reduces the time to screen for our customers from hours to literally just seconds. So a huge value prop for our customers.\nAnd finally, NewsEdge where we've been leveraging deep learning combined with natural language processing to enhance and optimize our data retrieval, enrichment and sentiment generation over our multi-domain data sets, employing state-of-the-art big data techniques. And to give you a sense of what this means in practical terms, our models are consuming, categorizing and scoring nearly 1 million new stories from over 20,000 sources each and every day. So these are just 3 of our over -- I'd say over a dozen AI-enabled products, which bring a global team of engineers and product specialists with distinct and deep skill sets around natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\nAnd our historical foundational AI experience uniquely positions us, I think, to capitalize on the immense opportunities presented by generative AI. And gen AI is going to revolutionize how individuals and companies derive insights, how they participate in financial markets and how they navigate an increasingly complex world. And that's why we partnered with Microsoft. Combining Moody's vast proprietary data analytics and research with Microsoft's industry-leading gen AI technology and Azure OpenAI service, that's going to allow us to create new offerings that provide deeper, richer insights into risk than ever before. And by applying machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to large collections of data and insights, individuals and organizations will be able to drive greater efficiency, accuracy, insight and innovation and financial processes.\nAnd earlier today, we published a, I'd call it, teaser demo of one of our first gen AI innovations, and we're calling it the Moody's Research Assistant. It's an interactive chat feature that looks across Moody's vast data sets and research to provide customers with multifaceted and integrated perspectives of risks that few others can provide. And the assistant will have the ability to access data and content across multiple domains, such as firmographic data, credit indicators, economic forecast, and risk and reputational profiles and deliver results to users based on their own personalized needs. So we're beginning to preview this innovation with customers to demonstrate the really, I think, extraordinary value that it's going to bring, powered by Microsoft's technology and anchored by Moody's proprietary data. So be sure to check it out on our IR website.\nAnd importantly, I do want to acknowledge that Moody's gen AI is a journey of human enablement. And we have deployed this technology to all of our 14,000-plus employees. I call them our 14,000 innovators so that we can innovate at scale and pilot new ways to enrich our jobs with powerful new insights and improved productivity, all at our fingertips.\nAnd before I close, I'd like to give a big shout out to our employees. During the month of June, over 3,000 Moody's teammates, and I was with them, took part in 150-plus volunteer projects across 32 countries. And their efforts delivered over 8,600 volunteer hours dedicated to making a difference in our communities. So our people are living our values and it's great stuff. That concludes my prepared remarks. Mark and I would be very happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And then, of course, Mark and I will be happy to take your questions.\nSo while the first quarter experienced some market turbulence from the stress in the U.S. banking sector and as is frequently the case, this heightened market uncertainty drove some strong demand for both our insights and our risk assessment offerings, and we saw some very strong upticks in usage this quarter. We're also continuing to unlock the potential of MA and its great assets and businesses, and those include one of the world's premier credit and economics research businesses, a data and information business that includes one of the world's largest databases on companies and our award-winning Decision Solutions businesses serving KYC, banking and insurance workflows. And together, MA delivered 10% ARR growth as we continue to enhance and extend our mission-critical data analytics and workflow solutions.\nNow while MIS revenue declined 11% from a pretty robust first quarter of 2022, as we talked about on prior earnings calls, the anticipated rate of revenue decline did indeed moderate from what we experienced in the third and fourth quarters of last year as MIS really capitalized on strong investment-grade issuance in the first quarter. Improvement in issuance activity, combined with our decisive expense actions that we took last quarter, together enabled us to deliver more operating leverage as reflected by the meaningful increase in MIS's operating margin to almost 57%. And notably, the adjusted operating margin for the first quarter is up about 500 basis points over the margin for full year 2022.\nAnd at the same time, we're maintaining financial flexibility while funding strategic investments in things like product development, sales and go-to-market initiatives, modern cloud-based workflow platforms, data interoperability and accessibility and AI innovation, all to position us for the future.\nSo now let me move on to some of the results. And there are a few key things I want to highlight amongst the performance numbers that you see on the screen. First, MA revenue grew at 6% or 9% on a constant currency basis. ARR grew 10%, and we had solid growth across the board in data and information, research and insights and Decision Solutions. I'm going to touch on that in a little bit more detail in a few minutes. And as I'd mentioned just a couple of minutes ago, MIS revenue was down versus a challenging Q1 2022 comparable before issuance volumes really decelerated through the balance of last year. And corporate finance accounted for most of the decline this quarter, particularly in bank loans, and that was followed by structured finance as we saw some deals delayed amidst the market volatility in the quarter.\nSo despite overall revenues down 3% in the quarter, our overall adjusted operating margin was 44.6%, and that was up approximately 200 basis points versus our full year 2022 margin, again reflecting the benefit of those cost efficiency initiatives. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.99, and that includes $0.75 of aggregate benefits from the resolution of several outstanding tax matters.\nSo I mentioned earlier the upticks in the usage that we experienced across several products in the first quarter. And on the screen, I think you can get a sense for that. During the recent stress in the banking sector, traffic to our flagship website, moody's.com, was up approximately 20% from the prior year period. And that's important for a few reasons. First, as you've heard me say before, we've got the most experienced analytical teams in the industry, and that is why we have been recognized as the Best Credit Rating Agency by Institutional Investor Magazine 11 times in a row.\nAnd that experience allows us to be the industry's thought leader, which is even more important in times of stress and uncertainty like we experienced in the first quarter. And that thought leadership also drives increased demand for our insights, for our research and for access to our analysts. And together, that all supports our value proposition and our growth opportunity for both ratings and research. Now demand for our solutions during times of stress and uncertainty goes beyond ratings and research, and you can see it across a range of MA offerings. And during the peak period of banking stress last month, usage of our cloud-based asset liability management solution, which enables banks to model and manage their maturity, interest rate and liquidity risk, rose nearly 50%.\nAnd with -- as we were witnessing unprecedented deposit flows moving across banks, the use of our screening and risk monitoring KYC solutions grew by almost 30%. We've also more than doubled the number of in-person customer sales meetings over the last year, and that's been supported by investments to expand the size of our sales team by almost 20% since the beginning of 2022, and you've heard us talk about that on these calls. And together, the increased usage and the sales engagement give us confidence in our full year low double-digit ARR growth outlook for MA.\nNow this past quarter, MA delivered 10% ARR growth, which as I mentioned, was consistent and strong across all lines of business. And I'll start with data and information. That includes Orbis, one of the world's largest databases on companies, plus our ratings and news feeds and 300 million ESG scores. That grew ARR at almost -- at around 9%. And in addition to the very strong stand-alone demand for private company data in Orbis, it's the integration of this data across MA's offerings that's helping to drive growth in other lines of business. And this includes the integration of Orbis company data into our CreditLens lending solution for banks and the integration of our ESG scores into insurance and banking underwriting and portfolio solutions.\nNow moving to research and insights, which includes our leading credit and economic research business and a growing suite of predictive analytics also grew ARR by 9% this quarter. And we're seeing some strong and sustained demand for our economic data, research and models, particularly amidst the stress in and, I guess I would say, around the banking sector. And this includes our new EDF-X platform, which combines our award-winning risk models with Orbis to analyze credit risk for any company in the world. And we recently completed the integration of EDF-X alongside CreditView into the moody's.com gateway, which provides direct access to a growing suite of Moody's products and enhances our customers' experience and enables further cross-selling opportunities.\nAnd finally, Decision Solutions, which includes our businesses serving KYC, insurance and banking workflows, grew ARR by 11%. And given this is our fastest-growing segment, I want to provide just a little bit more visibility into these offerings and what is driving growth. And these are really 3 great businesses because they support mission-critical workflows across financial institutions. And the virtuous cycle of data network effects and the high switching costs translate into industry-leading retention rates, which are typically in the low to mid-90s. And we've discussed our KYC business on earnings calls before. This business supports customer onboarding, perpetual KYC monitoring and sanction screening on customer suppliers and other third parties.\nAnd the strong growth in this area has been driven by our ability to cover really all aspects of KYC and anti-money laundering activity, bringing together our vast data sets on companies and people plus AI-enabled risk intelligence and cloud-based workflow orchestration that's delivered through our new PassFort life cycle platform.\nSo moving on to insurance. The addition of RMS has now given us a considerable business serving underwriting, risk and capital management and regulatory reporting workflows at insurers and reinsurers. And like banks, insurance companies are moving towards greater automation and digitization as well as the integration of more third-party data and analytics to enhance their risk management processes. And the RMS intelligent risk platform is really a cutting-edge cloud-based platform that supports a growing range of workflow and data and modeling capabilities for insurers. And the latest product launched from this platform is our new Climate on Demand solution.\nThat integrates RMS's climate and physical risk models with our extensive Orbis and commercial property data sets to provide a sophisticated on-demand financial quantification of physical risk that enables a holistic view into a company's exposure to extreme weather events and climate change through its customers, suppliers and properties. And not only will this be useful for insurance underwriting, but we're seeing robust demand for this beyond the insurance sector, including with banks, corporates, governmental entities and professional services as we expected when we announced the deal almost 2 years ago.\nAnd so third is our business serving banking workflows, which are quite similar actually to those served in insurance. They include lending, risk management, incorporating credit portfolio and asset liability management risk and finance and planning, which includes things like impairment accounting and regulatory capital reporting. And our most significant recent product launch in this space and 1 that is contributing to our double-digit ARR growth in banking was CreditLens for commercial real estate, which you've heard me talk about on prior calls. And that integrates our market forecast, our commercial property data, with our SaaS lending solution, CreditLens, and it really significantly extends our ability to serve the commercial real estate lending market.\nAnd stepping back, what sets our offerings apart from many of our competitors is that it's not simply software, but instead, we deliver integration of our proprietary data and analytics through modern cloud-based architecture. And this is further enabled by the use of sophisticated machine learning and artificial intelligence across many of our solutions, including our automated financial spreading platform and our KYC AI review, which help customers be even more effective and more efficient. And it's that combination of data, analytics, cloud-based tech and innovation that powered us to the #1 ranking in Chartis RiskTech 100 back in November.\nSo let me talk just briefly about how this translates to a typical customer relationship, and in this case, it's a top 50 regional bank in the United States. And as I mentioned, our workflow solutions combining data analytics and cloud-based software help banks really, throughout their value chain, interconnecting what are often siloed use cases across departments, from lending to risk management to finance and planning. And it's common for us to start by serving one of those use cases and then to expand the relationship over time as the bank looks to connect its various functions, leveraging our interconnected data models and solutions.\nSo our customer with this particular -- excuse me, our relationship with this particular customer started back in 2019 when they began to use our models, and that includes the EDF model that I just talked about, as foundational capabilities to really create a common language of risk in the institution. And in this case, they deployed our models to support a new internal risk rating program that enabled quantitative, unbiased and consistent internal practices for credit assessment across the bank. And over the next 2 years, we deepened that relationship by providing the bank with a workflow solution that leveraged these models and combined economic data and business analytics models with our Impairment Studio software to upgrade their current expected credit loss, or you've heard us say CECL on these calls, to upgrade those processes.\nAnd in 2022, again leveraging some of the same data and analytics capabilities, we broadened the relationship further to support their lending needs through a combination of our AI-enabled spreading tool and our CreditLens loan origination software that includes credit score. We did the same to support their forecasting and stress testing needs, bringing together another 5 Moody's products and drawing on some of the data and analytics the bank was using elsewhere. And this resulted in expanded licensing of several existing products but also subscriptions for new products. And in just 3 years, we've -- 3, 4 years, we've grown the ARR from this relationship fivefold.\nAnd as you can see on the far right, this ARR then shows up in different MA lines of businesses with 65% Decision Solutions and 35% in research and insights but really all for the same customer for a set of lending, risk and capital management and finance and planning use cases. And there's still further potential and we're in active discussions with this bank about supporting their KYC needs. So this is really just one of really hundreds of instances of how we've expanded relationships with our banking customers in recent years and accelerated growth by offering comprehensive solutions that leverage capabilities across all 3 MA lines of business and really more broadly across all of Moody's. And that is our integrated risk strategy at work. That is what makes our solutions so valuable and so sticky.\nSo let me move to MIS for a moment. Issuance was stronger in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. And while volatility and uncertainty constrained the structured and bank loan markets, we did see robust activity in the investment-grade sector. And in the first quarter, issuance represented almost 30% of our full year outlook, which is a pretty typical historical seasonality pattern. And as you can see, growth was higher for investment grade and lower for leveraged finance. As we said on our last earnings call, we would expect markets to open up with higher-quality credits before those further down the credit rating spectrum such as high-yield and bank loan issuers, and that is, in fact, what we saw in the first quarter.\nIf markets continue to improve, we'd expect to see leveraged finance issuance pick up. And the degree to which that happens is going to be based on a number of factors, and that includes macroeconomic risks and policy actions, market sentiment and credit spreads and economic growth and private equity activity, among other things.\nSo staying on MIS just for a moment, over the course of the last several months, we've gotten a number of questions about MIS's growth drivers, especially over the longer term. So Mark and I thought it would be helpful to talk about how we think about the building blocks to MIS revenue growth over the long term. And while the short- to medium-term outlook can be impacted by cyclical factors, the long-term growth algorithm, as we like to think of it, for MIS revenue, we believe, remains firmly intact.\nAnd first and foremost, debt issuance growth over the longer term is driven by global GDP growth as issuers invest and grow their businesses. And we expect global GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range over the long term, and that's in line with historical average over several decades. Second, the value proposition for ratings remains firmly intact, particularly for MIS ratings. And that supports an annual pricing opportunity consistent with the broader opportunity across all of Moody's in the 3% to 4% range. And third, there are long-term tailwinds from the ongoing development of capital markets around the world. And this includes slow and steady levels of disintermediation in developed markets like Europe, as well as higher rates of growth in smaller capital markets in developing countries.\nAnd together, this gives a sense for what we believe is the long-term growth profile of this business, while I acknowledge over shorter time horizons, the growth rate may be above, below or within this band, depending on the nature of the headwinds and tailwinds that we're showing at the bottom of the page. So I hope that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about growth and how that may triangulate with our medium-term outlook. And as we look toward the rest of the year, we're confident in the prospects for our business. That's supported by strong demand for our solutions and our expertise and a robust product development pipeline. So we're reaffirming the majority of our guidance with select updates to expenses as well as our diluted and adjusted diluted EPS metrics. GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS are now expected to be between $8.45 and $8.95, and $9.50 and $10, respectively.\nSo to close, I want to acknowledge that our growth and resilience as a firm rests on the shoulders of our people across the company, and I want to thank them for their continued commitment and efforts and dedication to serving our customers, to supporting each other and to delivering for our shareholders. So this concludes my prepared remarks, and Mark and I would be happy to take your questions. Over to you, operator."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of IR, Moody's Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, our outlook for full year 2023 and an update on our medium-term targets. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com.\nDuring this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call and U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. Rob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our results, key business highlights and outlook. After which, he'll be joined by Mark Kaye, Moody's Chief Financial Officer, to answer your questions. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. I'm going to start with some key takeaways from our 2022 results, and then I'll look ahead to what we're expecting for 2023 before we take your questions.\nOur fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results demonstrate the positive momentum and resilience of MA, while at the same time, reflecting the impact of challenging market conditions on MIS. And MA had a very strong finish to the year, delivered its 60th consecutive quarter of growth and 10% ARR growth. Revenue grew 15% for the year. And for the first time, MA's full year adjusted operating margin exceeded 30%, and those are results that achieve the Rule of 40 distinction.\nMIS generated $2.7 billion in revenue as it weathered a challenging year for issuance, and we continue to advance our ratings franchise to ensure that we're well positioned to capture future issuance growth. And during the fourth quarter, we executed on the expanded expense management program that we announced in October. That's expected to deliver over $200 million in annualized savings in 2023. And it really significantly strengthens our financial position and flexibility for the coming year.\nNow for the full year 2023, we expect Moody's revenue to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. And in addition, we're maintaining our previously communicated medium-term growth targets with a reset of the base year to 2022. And in what is clearly a fast-paced and ever-evolving landscape, we're investing with intent to grow and scale and to expand our capabilities to deliver on our mission, and that is providing best-in-class integrated perspectives on risk.\nSo turning to our full year financials. Moody's total revenue was $5.5 billion. MA contributed approximately half of our total revenue for the first time in our history. And as I mentioned, MA revenue grew by 15%, and excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, growth would have been 20%. Organic constant dollar growth for both MA revenue and ARR was 10%. And overall, Moody's achieved a 42.6% adjusted operating margin with an adjusted diluted EPS of $8.57.\nNow moving on. We remain laser focused on the 4 strategic priorities that I outlined in February of 2021 in order to realize the potential of our global integrated risk assessment strategy. And the success of this strategy has been made possible by our incredibly talented and committed employees. They've helped us launch new products, expand into new markets and improve the experience for our customers. And it's really wonderful to see our collective work achieve a number of important industry awards.\nFor the first time, Moody's earned the top ranking in the Chartis RiskTech100. And we placed ahead of hundreds of companies in the risk and compliance technology space that ranges from household names in our sector to earlier-stage innovators. And it's really a testament to the momentum of our risk assessment strategy and the quality of our portfolio of solutions. And in addition, for the 11th consecutive year, MIS was voted the Best Credit Rating Agency by Institutional Investor and really demonstrates that we remain the clear agency of choice with investors.\nIn MIS, in 2022, we made several important investments to enhance our ratings presence in emerging markets. And that includes the acquisition of our majority stake in the largest domestic rating agency in Africa and the further expansion of Moody's Local in Latin America. We also met the need for greater transparency in ESG risks, specifically as they relate to credit by rolling out more than 10,000 new ESG credit impact scores across MIS.\nNow across MA, we enhanced a number of our workflow offerings through the integration of data and analytics, and we created new products to meet evolving customer needs. In fact, newly developed organic products contributed a significant portion of MA sales growth in 2022. I'm going to touch on several of these in a few minutes.\nTurning to the outlook for MIS. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that the factors that impacted issuance in 2022 to persist really through the first half of 2023. The inflationary environment, the pace of interest rate increases are still causing volatility in equity and debt markets, and the trajectory of economic growth in major economies remains uncertain.\nSo it's going to take some time for these issues to resolve and for debt market activity to fully resume. But refunding needs and pent-up issuance demand and baseline economic growth, they all point to a recovery in issuance, which we expect to pick up in the second half of the year. And in this environment, we are proactively balancing our commitment to serve issuers and investors with the highest quality ratings and research and insights, while at the same time, prudently managing cost. And we expect that the swift and decisive expense management actions that we took in the fourth quarter will enable MIS's adjusted operating margin to return to the mid-50s percent range in 2023.\nSo moving to MA. I want to highlight the impact of the significant investments that we've made in product development and sales and acquisitions. And over the last 3 years, these investments have helped us deliver $1 billion in additional recurring revenue. And on an organic constant currency basis, recurring revenue growth has been steadily improving each year from 9.2% in 2020 to 9.7% in 2021 and 11.1% in 2022.\nAnd we're well positioned for future growth as 3 of our businesses with revenue of more than $100 million each delivered ARR growth in excess of 10%. In fact, our KYC and compliance business, which is our fastest-growing business, had ARR growth greater than 20%. And even some of our more established products such as Orbis and CreditView delivered high single-digit ARR growth last year.\nSo let me give you a little bit of insight into how several of our newly-launched products are contributing to this growth. And I'm going to start with our KYC life cycle solution, which offers customers a user-friendly configurable portal and risk engine. And it enables fast and accurate checks that leverage our vast company, people and news data sets.\nAnd this solution integrates the capabilities that we've built and acquired over the past several years, so it's opening the door to new markets and customer segments with a powerful new workflow tool for financial crime compliance and third-party due diligence. And it is resonating with our customers. In the fourth quarter, we completed one of our largest-ever sales to a nonfinancial corporate customer, NMA, with a combined offering supporting both customer and supplier vetting and screening capabilities.\nWe also recently launched an enhanced version of our Climate on Demand product, which integrates our very rich climate analytics from RMS and MA and broadens the scope of our capabilities in the banking and insurance sectors and beyond. And Climate on Demand is part of our growing suite of physical and transition risk offerings, which are gaining traction with our customers.\nFor example, we were awarded an important sales mandate late last year as a major U.S. financial regulator selected us to help them better understand and measure the impact of climate on risks facing financial institutions in the broader economy. And we were selected because of our ability to bring together some unique capabilities from across Moody's, and that includes our ability to quantify the financial impact of climate risk, physical risk assessment of bank operations and exposures as well as financed emissions.\nAnd in banking, we extended our CreditLens origination solution into commercial real estate, and that's one of the largest asset classes on bank balance sheets. And this product integrates our proprietary property data, market forecast and credit analytics to meet the specific needs of commercial real estate lenders.\nAnd we're excited to partner on this product with one of the largest real estate lenders in the United States, and we're encouraged by the positive customer feedback and sales progress to date. So together, these examples, I think, demonstrate how we are integrating capabilities, we're driving product innovation and leveraging our very strong sales distribution to build a robust pipeline as a foundation for continued growth.\nSo let me turn to the outlook for 2023, and I want to highlight just a few of our guidance metrics. We project that Moody's revenue will grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 44% to 45%. Adjusted diluted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $9 to $9.50. And for the medium term, we're maintaining our previously communicated growth targets with a reset of the base year to 2022.\nAnd in summary, we made strong progress in the fourth quarter to position the business for success, closing out what we'd characterize as both a challenging and a productive year. And indeed, against the backdrop of macroeconomic headwinds, we've continued to unlock the growing potential of MA and reinforced the foundation for MIS to capture the immense opportunity we see once issuance levels recover.\nSo we've entered 2023 in a position of strength, and I have tremendous confidence in the growth potential of the business as we continue to execute and invest in building Moody's as the leading provider of integrated perspectives on risk. And with that, Mark and I would be pleased to take your questions. Operator?"

I will now turn the call over to Rob Fauber.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nThanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. Like I did last quarter, I'm going to start with a few takeaways.\nAnd as everybody is aware, during the third quarter, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions continued to deteriorate, and that further suppressed the global debt issuance markets from the already subdued levels that we have seen in the first half of the year. At the same time, these conditions supported increasing customer demand for data and analytics to identify, measure and manage risk. And against this backdrop, our MA business continued to perform well, with strong revenue growth of 14%, while MIS revenue declined by 36%. Overall, Moody's generated $1.3 billion in revenue with an adjusted operating margin of 39%.\nAnd we expect that low issuance volumes, particularly in the leveraged finance space, will persist through the remainder of the year. And as a result, we're revising several of our 2022 outlook metrics, including our guidance for total Moody's revenue, which is now expected to decline in the low double-digit range. And we're also updating our outlook for full year adjusted diluted EPS to now be between $8.20 and $8.50.\nNow in response to the expectation for continued economic headwinds, we're also taking decisive steps to reduce our expense run rate by at least $200 million by year end. And the cost savings will be realized across the company and include a more than doubling in the size of our previously announced restructuring program as well as various additional cost efficiency initiatives. And collectively, these actions put us in a position of strength as we head into 2023, and I'll provide some additional details later in the call.\nNow for the third quarter, MA recorded both strong revenue growth of 14% and a 9% increase in annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. With over half of MA's business outside the U.S., foreign exchange rates had an outsized impact on MA's revenue growth, lowering it by 7 percentage points. And for MIS, the 36% decrease in revenue against the record prior year period was driven by a 41% reduction in issuance. And altogether, this resulted in a 16% decline in Moody's revenue. And the negative impact of foreign currency movements on total Moody's revenue was 4 percentage points.\nAnd our expenses grew just 1% in the third quarter as we continue to execute efficiency initiatives and emphasize cost discipline. And the net impact of lower revenue and controlled expenses translated to adjusted operating income of $497 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85.\nNow let me provide some additional context on the conditions impacting issuance levels and our revised full year outlook for MIS. And at the beginning of the year, like others in the market, we anticipated that elevated levels of inflation would be transitory and slowly abate over the course of 2022. And instead, the conflict in Ukraine further impacted market confidence and commodity price shocks pushed inflation higher.\nAnd these factors prompted central banks to raise interest rates further and faster than expected to levels we haven't seen for more than a decade, and resulting in ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets. In the meanwhile, corporate balance sheets remained robust, following a surge in opportunistic pandemic-era financing, allowing issuers to stay on the sidelines, given the market conditions.\nWe expect that these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions will continue to mute issuance levels at least through year-end. And in light of this, we're updating our guidance for 2022 MIS-rated issuance to decline in the mid-30s percent range. Full year MIS revenue is now projected to decrease by approximately 30%. And while the outlook for next year will depend on the pace and scope of market stabilization and recovery, we're confident that conditions will improve over time and that the key growth drivers for issuance will resume.\nThis year, only a little more than 1/4 of the first-time mandates that we've signed have gone to market, meaning there's a backlog waiting to tap the markets. And to leverage those opportunities, our teams have been engaging extensively with investors and issuers, and we haven't been sitting still.\nWe've been building our domestic rating franchises, including in Africa with the majority acquisition of GCR, and across Latin America through Moody's Local. And we've made significant progress in digitizing our content to both improve the customer experience but also to drive increased usage. As we look ahead, our pricing opportunity remains intact, and we know there are over $4 trillion in refunding needs that will likely be refinanced over the coming 4 years.\nIn short, we're continuing to deliver on our differentiated strategy to be the agency of choice for our customers. While current conditions for MIS are challenging, as those ease, issuance will accelerate and we will be well positioned to capture growth and operating leverage through our extensive market presence.\nNow turning to MA, which despite the challenging market conditions, delivered another impressive quarter of revenue growth and margin expansion. 59 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, MA has proven to be acyclical, and the third quarter was no different. MA reported 14% revenue growth or 9% on an organic constant currency basis. And with best-in-class retention rates and growing customer demand, MA also achieved 9% ARR growth for the third quarter, and that's inclusive of RMS.\nAnd we're confirming our top line revenue guidance for 2022. MA full year revenue is expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range, and that's despite a 5 percentage point headwind from foreign exchange rates. We expect ARR to accelerate to low double-digit percent growth by year-end. We're also raising the MA adjusted margin guidance to approximately 30%, and that's a 100 basis point increase over our prior guidance, reflecting ongoing expense efficiency.\nSo let me take a moment just to highlight our fastest-growing business, and that's KYC and compliance solutions. And in recent years, we've invested, and that's been both organically and inorganically, in acquiring, developing and integrating data analytics and technology to create a world-class set of solutions. And this combination supports new use cases around counterparty verification. That's enabling us to grow with existing customers and add new customers in areas like the fintech, corporate and government sectors.\nWe continue to receive industry awards and recognition, including most recently, a top-right quadrant positioning from Chartis. We also won the AI Breakthrough Award for our innovative solution for fraud prevention. And that's one of an increasing number of places where we're being recognized for the integration of artificial intelligence into our solutions.\nAlso, as we pass on the 1-year anniversary of the RMS acquisition, let me give a quick update on that. We're on track to achieve the financial targets announced last August, and I'm excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. We are laser-focused on maximizing our synergy opportunities by launching new products and pursuing markets that leverage our combined capabilities and strengths.\nSo for example, this past quarter, we launched our ESG underwriting solution for property and casualty insurers, which integrates Moody's extensive data to help them operationalize ESG risk assessment into their insurance underwriting workflows.\nAnd I also want to recognize the great work being done by our colleagues at RMS. And in my meetings with customers over the last few months, I've heard firsthand about how important our solutions are in helping the industry address an increasing array of risks, including recently, as we assisted our customers in rapidly quantifying the financial impact of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian.\nNow moving to the restructuring plan that I mentioned earlier. On our last earnings call, we said that we would take additional actions to manage expenses and improve operating leverage if we observed further deterioration in the external environment. And given our view that the weakness in the issuance market will likely persist through at least the fourth quarter of 2022, our teams have undertaken a careful review of prioritization of ongoing initiatives, and we've identified several avenues for meaningful savings.\nWe are expanding our restructuring program to more than double, providing up to $135 million in savings in 2023 from a combination of rationalizing our real estate footprint and reducing our global workforce to reflect the reality of the current market environment. We have also undertaken a careful prioritization of ongoing initiatives in light of our current business priorities. And that has identified up to $100 million in additional savings.\nSo collectively, these are projected to lower our 2023 expense run rate by at least $200 million. And as we take these decisive actions, we will be mindful to invest and allocate resources to maintain the rigor and quality of our ratings and processes.\nLook, these are challenging and uncertain times, and we are prioritizing financial discipline today and making sure that we're well positioned to capture growth opportunities tomorrow.\nSo that includes -- that concludes my prepared remarks, and Mark and I would be pleased to take your questions. Operator."

At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded (Operator Instructions).\nI will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of IR, Moody's Corporation\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss Moody's second quarter '22 results and our revised outlook for full year 2022. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the second quarter of 2022 as well as our revised outlook for full year 2022. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. During this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website. These, together with the safe harbor statement, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. Before we begin, I'm pleased to announce that in response to feedback from our external stakeholders, we have enhanced our earnings materials and changed the format of our call for this quarter. This morning, on our IR website, we published our supplementary presentation along with our updated earnings release, materials that we believe provide substantial insights into our business. As such, during the call, we will not be going through our usual presentation. Instead, Rob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of our results and outlook, after which he will be joined by Mark Kaye, Moody's Chief Financial Officer, to answer your questions.\nI will now turn the call over Rob Fauber.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nThanks, Shivani. Hello, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. And as Shivani mentioned, I'm going to keep my opening remarks brief so that we can get straight to your questions. And I appreciate that it's been a very busy morning for many of you on the call. So let me begin with a few key takeaways about our results. And then I want to spend a few minutes on our outlook and the continued strength and relevance of our business.\nSo let me start by reinforcing that as challenging and volatile conditions in global capital markets continue, we're leading the way in providing integrated perspectives on risk for our customers. And this quarter was really a tale of 2 cities as our ratings business was significantly impacted by the slowdown in issuance activity and our MA business continued to grow very nicely. And as we've said previously, year-on-year comparisons with our record performance in 2021 would be unfavorable this year. And overall, Moody's revenue declined approximately 11% in the second quarter.\nAnd given the operating leverage in the MIS business as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined by 31% from the prior period -- prior year period to $2.22. MIS, which was significantly impacted by ongoing cyclical disruption in the global debt markets due to a few things, rising interest rates, high inflation, unsettled geopolitical conditions, MIS generated revenue of $706 million. And really, to put that in perspective, global rated issuance was down 32% for the quarter and transaction revenue was down 40%, and that reflects the negative mix driven by the weakness in the leveraged finance markets. And when balanced by our recurring revenue, this translated to a 28% decline in total MIS revenue for the quarter.\nNow on the other hand, customer demand for our MA suite of solutions that help navigate market uncertainty and identify and measure and manage risk -- that demand remained robust. And that fueled steady growth in our subscription and SaaS-based products, which, along with the contributions from prior year acquisitions, delivered revenue growth of 18%. And MA revenue growth was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to FX in the quarter. Now you'll recall earlier this year, we introduced an annualized recurring revenue or ARR metric for MA, and we believe that's a good indicator of future growth.\nIn this quarter, our organic ARR grew by 9%, and we expect this growth to further increase to low double digits by year-end. And that's supported by both our ongoing product development investments that broaden the ways in which we serve our customers and by the growth in our sales force and strong sales execution. Now I expect that many of you will have questions about our outlook in a few minutes. And I'd like to make a few comments about our expectations before we get to it in the Q&A. And we anticipate that the current market disruption will persist for the remainder of the year, and we've updated our guidance to reflect that. Now obviously, if actual conditions differ from the assumptions underlying our guidance, our results for the year may differ from our revised outlook.\nNow for MIS, we expect issuance to decline approximately 30% for the year and full year 2022 revenue to decrease in the low 20s percent range. Now the last 2.5 years have been unusual to say the least, so I have to acknowledge that, with all the uncertainty in the market, the confidence interval around our outlook is probably wider than it was prepandemic. Our business outlook for MA remains unchanged. However, due to the impact of the weakening euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar, we're slightly reducing MA's revenue growth outlook to the mid-teens percent range. Now taking the reduced MIS revenue guidance and the impact of foreign exchange into account, we now forecast Moody's full year 2022 revenue to decline in the high single-digit percent range and adjusted earnings per share are now projected to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.70.\nIncorporated into our outlook is a new restructuring program, and that's part of our broader approach to expense management. This geolocation restructuring program helps us further adapt to the new global workplace and talent realities, and it accelerates a number of ongoing cost efficiency initiatives. And that includes real estate optimization and increased utilization of lower-cost operational hubs. We expect this program to generate $40 million to $60 million in annualized savings with up to $75 million in aggregate charges through 2023. And we plan to partially redeploy these savings back into the business to support ongoing organic investments, including things like sales deployment and employee retention.\nNow before I open it up to questions, let me try to put all this into perspective for a few minutes. Now debt issuance markets are clearly in a period of cyclical turbulence. However, we believe that the fundamental drivers of issuance remain firmly intact. And taking a medium-term view, we expect issuance to resume as capital markets adjust to a higher interest rate environment. And as you saw in the slides that we shared this morning, the volume of outstanding corporate debt in the U.S. has grown each year for the last 30 years, and we believe that the fundamental role of debt in fueling economic activity and financing business growth remains unchanged.\nGlobal GDP growth is expected to continue, albeit at a lower rate. Corporate refinancing needs remain strong. And on a historical basis, rates and spreads are relatively in line with their averages despite some recent increases. During this period of market turbulence, we're going to continue to focus on what we can control in MIS. And that is to ensure that Moody's remains the rating agency of choice, providing a world-class experience for issuers and ensuring the quality, relevance and timeliness of our ratings, research and insights that all reinforce investor demand pull.\nMA remains a strong and resilient business with almost 60 quarters of consecutive growth. And our investments in product development and sales are accelerating our organic ARR growth, and we're realizing the benefits of our recent acquisitions. In fact, we're ahead of or have met the targets that we shared for our acquisitions of BvD and RDC, and though it's early days, we are on track to meet our targets for RMS.\nNow stepping back and looking at the big picture again for just a moment. We see strong demand for our integrated risk assessment offerings. And the value that Moody's provides to our customers, especially in these uncertain times, remains unmatched. So across the business, we're innovating and investing to provide our customers and market participants with the products and the insights that they need to decode risks and unlock opportunities. And lastly, all of this would not be possible without the tremendous efforts of our people, and I want to thank them for all of their continued hard work and dedication.\nSo that concludes my prepared remarks. So Mark and I would be pleased to take your questions. Operator?"

Good morning, and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. I'll begin by providing a general update on the business, including our first quarter 2022 results. And following my commentary, Mark Kaye will provide some further details on our first quarter 2022 performance as well as our revised 2022 outlook. And after our prepared remarks, as always, Mark and I will be happy to take questions.\nSo against a backdrop of geopolitical turbulence and volatile markets, Moody's first quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, and that's down 5% from the prior year period. With the decline in issuance in the first quarter and our expectation for continued subdued levels of opportunistic issuance for the balance of the year, we've updated our full year 2022 guidance, and we now project Moody's revenue to be approximately flat relative to the prior year. We've also lowered our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $10.75 to $11.25.\nMA continued to be a strong source of consistent growth, while market disruptions impacted issuance activity as investments to meet customer demand for our mission-critical suite of tools and solutions drove revenue growth up 23%. Recurring revenue is core to this growth which is why we're introducing a new reporting metric, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and we expect this new metric to provide greater transparency into the growth trajectory of MA's recurring revenue.\nThe temporary impact of market uncertainty on our financial performance does not change our expectations for the medium term. And time and time again, in periods of uncertainty like these, markets and organizations look to Moody's for expertise and insights, increasing the demand for our integrated risk assessment offerings. And so we remain confident in the fundamental drivers of our growth.\nMoody's revenue was down just 5% from a year ago, reflecting the diversity and resilience of our business portfolio. And while MIS revenue decreased 20%, MA revenue was up 23% or 9% on an organic basis, driven by strong customer demand for our solutions. Adjusted operating income fell 20% to $734 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.89, a decrease of 29% year-on-year. And Mark will provide some additional details on our financials shortly.\nNow turning to MIS. The issuance factors we highlighted during our fourth quarter earnings call really remain unchanged as elevated inflation and the prospect of additional interest rate increases, combined with the impact of the Ukraine conflict, are contributing to uncertainty and volatility. And these factors have adversely affected debt capital markets activity, including opportunistic refinancing and M&A transactions, particularly in the leverage finance markets.\nAnd as we've said over the years, periods of market disruption need to be put into historical context, and I would argue that this period is no different. And this chart illustrates our rated issuance over the last decade with the gray bars representing periods of market volatility. And it shows that activity typically rebounds after periods of market disruption and has grown steadily over time. And though there's uncertainty as to how long the current disruption will last, we believe that the market will eventually reset amidst higher interest rates and will eventually resume issuance growth supported by economic expansion and substantial financing maturity walls.\nNow the medium-term drivers of debt issuance and our business remains strong. And as we said in the past, issuance is a function of several macroeconomic factors, the most significant of which is economic expansion. Looking ahead, we do expect global GDP growth for the remainder of the year, albeit at a modest pace. The underpinnings of the economy remain sound, and consumer and corporate balance sheets remain healthy, and U.S. unemployment remains at near historical lows.\nWhile several rounds of interest rate increases are expected this year, as the Fed addresses inflation, rates will remain low by historical standards. Volatility in the credit markets has been reflected in spread fluctuations. Those spreads also remain well below the 10-year average. And taken as a whole, the cost of borrowing remains historically low.\nIn addition to these factors, there's a healthy stock of debt which needs to be refinanced, more than $4 trillion over the next 4 years. And we expect the continued buildup in our first-time mandates will drive growth in our recurring revenue, as demonstrated over the last 2 years.\nNow pivoting to Moody's Analytics. We're driving robust growth across the breadth of our products and solutions. In the first quarter, revenue was up 23%, supported by organic revenue growth of 9% and a 96% customer retention rate. We're now including annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, in our reporting to give an indication of our revenue expectations for the future. Organic ARR was up 9% for the first quarter, demonstrating the strength of our recurring revenue across the business. Again, Mark will provide some additional details on ARR shortly.\nI'd like to take a moment to share a story that illustrates how offerings across our 3 reporting lines in MA come together to provide value for our customers. As a result of the acquisition of Bureau van Dijk in 2017, we had a modest relationship with a large multinational insurance underwriter that was using our Orbis database to support sales and marketing activities.\nFollowing the acquisition, we had a series of discussions with this and other customers about ways to address a wider range of their needs, which, in this case, included their process for underwriting trade credit insurance. We were able to package our Orbis data, our credit research and credit scorecards, combined with our AI-enabled spreading offering, to provide a set of integrated solutions that transform their workflow, helping them to eliminate 70% of their manual tasks in their trade credit underwriting process and increasing their efficiency and enhancing their effectiveness. This upsell resulted in approximately 300% increase in annual customer revenue.\nAnd today, we're having discussions with them about further expanding our relationship to serve additional use cases and solutions, including integrating ESG into their underwriting processes. And I think it's just a great example of our ability to expand our customer relationships by bringing together the full capabilities across Moody's Analytics.\nAs you know, helping the market make sense of the risks and opportunities posed by ESG and climate change is a priority for us, and we're increasingly delivering solutions that help companies incorporate these critical factors into their decision-making. And that's an important reason for our acquisition of RMS last year. In addition to building a business serving the insurance industry, RMS brings scaled world-class weather and climate data and analytics which we're bringing to a much broader customer audience.\nInclusive of revenue from RMS' climate-related offerings, our combined revenue for our ESG and Climate Solutions was approximately $170 million in 2021. We expect this revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range this year. We also expect our climate revenues, which, today, are predominantly from RMS, to accelerate as we continue to integrate its best-in-class models to meet our customers' growing needs. And going forward, we'll update you on this revenue number as it provides, I think, a good sense of our scale and impact in this area.\nOur growth is supported by a number of key innovations and award-winning product launches. Last month, we launched ESG360, which is a powerful platform that delivers decision-relevant ESG data and insights to portfolio managers. We're also launching new climate change models in the U.S. and Asia that will help address the growing need for climate change analytics, including supporting increasing regulatory demands.\nWe're proud to have received recognition from customers for our ESG and climate-related products and services, including being named ESG Opinion Provider of the Year by the International Financing Review. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to play a meaningful role in helping companies decode risk and unlock opportunity.\nAnd speaking of decoding risk, our customers turn to us even more in times of stress and uncertainty, and we saw that during the throes of the pandemic. And as you can see on this slide, the relevance of our offerings has probably never been higher with significant leadership of our research and usage of our solutions. Our research reports have been read over 200,000 times, while KYC screenings are up 70% year-over-year as our customers have a critical need to better understand and monitor their own customers and suppliers amidst geopolitical conflict and sanctions.\nSo with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark to provide further details on Moody's first quarter results as well as an update to our outlook for 2022.\n\nMark Bradley Kaye\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Moody's Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. In the first quarter, MIS revenue declined 20% from last year's record level as geopolitical concerns, rising yields and elevated economic uncertainty contributed to a 25% decrease in rated issuance. Corporate finance, financial institutions and public, project infrastructure revenue declined 31%, 19% and 14%, respectively, with many issuers remaining on the sidelines due to unfavorable market conditions and existing levels of balance sheet liquidity. Structured finance revenue increased 24%, supported by 10% growth in issuance, primarily from commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, offset by a decline in CLO refinancing activity.\nMIS' adjusted operating margin was 58.6%. Revenue was adversely impacted by the noted absence of opportunistic issuance in the quarter, while operating expenses, excluding those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, remained relatively flat.\nMoving to MA. First quarter revenue grew 23%, delivering the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, revenue and recurring revenue were up 9% and 11%, respectively. In Decision Solutions, revenue increased 48% or 14% on an organic basis. This is driven by robust demand for KYC banking as well as insurance and asset management solutions. Research and insights revenue rose 7%, reflecting strong demand for our credit research, analytics and models, underpinned by a 97% customer retention rate. For data and information, revenue grew 6%, driven by new sales of the company's data and ratings feeds.\nMA's adjusted operating margin expanded by approximately 350 basis points from incremental operating leverage, net of ongoing organic investments. This was offset by approximately 430 basis points of margin contraction due to acquisitions completed within the last 12 months.\nOver the past few years, we have successfully transitioned the MA business to a predominantly subscription-based model with strong recurring revenue which now accounts for 94% of total MA revenue. This quarter, we are pleased to introduce a new forward-looking performance metric for our MA business. This new metric, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, is the annualized run rate of recurring revenue for active contracts at a point in time. Renewable contracts include subscriptions, term licenses and software maintenance. The ARR metric provides insight into the trajectory of MA's recurring revenue with visibility specifically into the growth of the subscription business from both our acquisition of new customers and the expansion of existing relationships.\nAs of March 31, 2020, MA's ARR of $2.6 billion reflected 25% growth from the prior year period or 9% on an organic basis. In addition, we are guiding to low double-digit organic ARR growth for year-end '22, reflecting our expectation for accelerated renewable sales through the remainder of the year.\nTurning now to our revised guidance. Moody's updated outlook for full year 2022 as of May 2 reflects assumptions about numerous factors. These include, but are not limited to, the effective interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, capital market liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt markets. The outlook also reflects assumptions about general economic conditions, global GDP growth, the scale and duration of the crisis in Ukraine and the impact of COVID-19 as well as the company's own operations and personnel.\nOur updated full year 2022 guidance incorporates the following specific macroeconomic assumptions: the 2022 U.S. and Euro area GDP to expand by approximately 3.5% to 4.5% and 2.5% to 3.5%, respectively; and global benchmark rates to increase from historic lows; with U.S. high-yield spreads moving slightly above the historic average of approximately 500 basis points; and inflation rates to remain elevated and above central bank targets in many countries. By year-end, the U.S. unemployment rate is expected to remain low at approximately 3.5%, and the global high-yield default rate will initially decline before gradually rising to approximately 2.7%. Our guidance also assumes foreign currency translation and for the remainder of 2022 reflects exchange rates for the British pound of $1.32 and $1.11 for the euro.\nWe are updating our full year 2022 guidance across several metrics to reflect both first quarter results and our revised expectation for the remainder of the year. We now forecast Moody's revenue to remain approximately flat to the prior year and for operating expenses to increase in the high single-digit percent range, down from our prior guidance as we prudently manage and prioritize investment activity through the cycle.\nConsequently, we now project Moody's adjusted operating margin to be approximately 47% and have lowered the diluted and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to $9.85 to $10.35 and $10.75 to $11.25, respectively.\nWe decreased our free cash flow forecast to be between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion and maintain our expectation for full year share repurchases of at least $1.5 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions, M&A opportunities and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Please refer to Table 13 of our earnings release for a full list of our guidance.\nTurning now to our issuance outlook, which we have updated in light of market disruptions in the first quarter and the expectation that opportunistic activity will likely remain constrained heading into the second quarter of the year. We forecast global rated issuance to decline in the mid-teens percent range and investment-grade activity to decrease by approximately 10%.\nLeveraged finance issuance has been acutely impacted by market uncertainty with over 20 days of no high-yield activity during the quarter. We now project full year 2022 high-yield and leverage loan issuance to decline by approximately 40% and 30%, respectively. Similarly, we forecast a 10% decrease in financial institutions activity and a 5% decline in public, project and infrastructure finance activity.\nIn structured finance, we expect wider spreads and a weaker future leverage loan supply to impact the financing and creation of new CLOs for the balance of the year. We are, therefore, revising our outlook for structured finance issuance to decline by approximately 10%.\nAnd finally, we are reducing our full year guidance for new mandates to a range of 850 to 950 despite a strong mandate result of almost 240 in the first quarter.\nDue to our revised rated issuance outlook, we now forecast MIS revenue to decrease in the low double-digit percent range. We have proportionately lowered MIS' adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 59%. This outlook remains above the pre-pandemic levels of 2018 and 2019, reflecting prudent spending on strategic investments and employee recognition, carefully balanced with ongoing cost efficiency initiatives.\nFor MA, we are reaffirming our guidance for high-teens revenue growth supported by tailwinds from recent acquisitions, strong customer retention rates and ARR outlook as well as robust demand for our subscription-based products as we successfully execute on our integrated risk assessment strategy. We are maintaining MA's adjusted operating margin guidance of approximately 29% as we organically invest in the business to further accelerate top line growth.\nI would like to provide additional insight into our disciplined approach to expense allocation and management, which we believe is critically important to ensure long-term sustainable growth as we move through the current short-term cyclical volatility impacting the MIS business. In the first quarter, operating expenses rose 16% over the prior year period. Approximately 13 percentage points of this growth were attributable to operational and integration-related costs associated with acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. Operating growth, including organic investments and annual compensation increases, net of ongoing efficiency initiatives, contributed approximately 6 percentage points. Lower incentive compensation accruals and a strengthening U.S. dollar offset expense growth by approximately 1% and 2 percentage points, respectively.\nFor the full year, we expect expense growth to be more than $100 million lower than our previous forecast, an increase now in the high single-digit percent range. This includes approximately 9 percentage points of growth attributable to acquisitions completed within the last 12 months.\nWe remain committed to invest an incremental $50 million and $150 million in 2022 to attract and retain world-class talent as well as to enhance our product capabilities and expand distribution to capture these new opportunities, respectively. We anticipate that these investments will be partially offset through our ongoing cost efficiency programs and lower incentive compensation accruals.\nLast, we strongly believe that the market volatility in the first half of the year is cyclical in nature and that the business fundamentals of both MIS and MA remain firmly intact. Therefore, it is especially important that we prudently manage our expenses and continue investing through the cycle in order to realize our medium-term growth prospects.\nBefore turning the call back over to Rob, I would like to highlight a few key takeaways. First, despite the challenging market environment, we delivered over $1.5 billion in revenue and an adjusted diluted EPS result of $2.89. Second, while short-term volatility and market cyclicality are affecting issuance levels, our business fundamentals remain strong. Third, MA's robust recurring revenue growth and high customer retention rates reflect the strong demand for our integrated risk assessment solutions and provide balance to Moody's overall results. Fourth, our new ARR metric provides further insight into our momentum towards achieving our medium-term targets. And finally, we remain focused on investing through the cycle to build market-leading products and capabilities in key strategic growth areas and balancing disciplined expense management with the return of stockholder capital.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nYes. Thanks, Mark. I want to close by recognizing the efforts of our people, and their continued dedication and hard work remain key to driving growth and resilience and delivering on our strategy as an integrated global risk assessment firm. And that's an additional reason despite the turbulent times in the issuance markets that I remain confident and optimistic about Moody's growth fundamentals. Our mission is even more critical as our customers rely on us to provide trusted insights and standards that help them make decisions with confidence in this environment.\nSo that concludes our prepared remarks, and Mark and I would be pleased to take your questions. Operator?"

At this time, I'd like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nShivani Kak\n\nHead of IR, Moody's Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Moody's fourth quarter 2021 results and our guidance. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations.\nThis morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and our outlook for full year 2022 and the medium term. The earnings press release and the presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at ir.moodys.com. Rob Fauber, Moody's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Mark Kaye, Moody's Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings press release filed this morning for a reconciliation between all adjusted measures referenced during this call in U.S. GAAP.\nI call your attention to the safe harbor language, which can be found towards the end of our earnings release. Today's remarks may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In accordance with the act, I also direct your attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis section and the risk factors discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other SEC filings made by the company, which are available on our website and on the SEC's website.\nThese, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements.\nI would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Rob Fauber.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nThanks, Shivani, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm going to begin by summarizing Moody's full year 2021 financial results, and then I'll provide an overview of our business and strategic direction. And following my commentary, Mark Kaye will provide some further details on our fourth quarter 2021 results and share our outlook for 2022 and also our new medium-term financial targets. And after our prepared remarks, as always, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOur employees' resilience and commitment and hard work produced some exceptional results in 2021. And I'm proud to share that for the first time, we surpassed $6 billion in revenue with record revenues from both MIS and MA. And adjusted diluted EPS grew at 21% in 2021.\nOver the past several years, we've invested to build our businesses serving high-growth risk assessment markets. And in 2021, in particular, to seize the really attractive growth opportunity in front of us, we made some substantial investments, particularly in the fourth quarter. Across the firm, we're introducing a range of new products and solutions to help customers identify, manage and measure risk and unlock opportunity, and the pace is accelerating. We're balancing these investments with capital returns and seek to return approximately $2 billion to our stockholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nFor 2022, we project Moody's revenue to increase in the high single-digit percent range. That's driven by continued strong growth from MA and robust global debt issuance levels for MIS. And I'm also pleased to announce that in response to investor feedback, we're introducing new medium-term guidance, including Moody's Corporation's revenue to grow by at least 10% on an average annualized basis and adjusted operating margin to be in the low 50s percent range. Recent acquisitions, combined with organic investments, put us in an excellent position to deliver on our integrated risk assessment strategy and achieve these targets.\nFinally, I want to remind you that Moody's will be hosting our next Investor Day on March 10 later this year in New York City. And during the event, we're going to be showcasing key aspects of our business, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person. It's been a while. And for those who are unable to attend, there will also be a virtual option.\nNow turning to full year results. Both MIS and MA revenue grew by 16%. MIS rated over $6 trillion of issuance and generated over 1,100 new mandates, and that's equivalent to almost 5 new mandates every working day of the year. And this, combined with MA's 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, helped us achieve our second successive year of 20-plus percent adjusted EPS growth.\n2021 was really a year where we accelerated our strategy to be the world's leading integrated risk assessment business and included investing for growth, purposeful innovation and delivering for our stakeholders. During the year, we made a series of acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and further build out our offerings. The largest of these acquisitions, RMS gives us a world-class insurance data and analytics franchise as well as some sophisticated weather and disaster modeling capabilities. And this allows us to serve a wide spectrum of customers, helping them to better understand the physical risks posed by climate change. And that's an important part of our broader ESG offerings.\nWe also made investments to build out our ratings presence in important international markets. And in 2021, we began offering local credit ratings in Brazil as part of the continued expansion of our Moody's Local business across Latin America. And just last week, we announced our intent to acquire a majority stake in GCR ratings, the leading credit rating agency in Africa, giving us an unmatched presence across the continent and really positioning us for the future.\nIn 2021, we expanded our suite of award-winning offerings with more than 15 meaningful product launches. This includes Portfolio Studio, our new cloud-native Software-as-a-Service credit portfolio management tool. It provides a single and powerful view of risk. As part of our broader ecosystem of risk finance and lending solutions, it enables our customers to identify and measure and manage portfolio risks and returns by combining best-in-class Moody's models, scenarios and other content with business applications for financial institutions.\nWe also launched the next generation of supply chain catalysts, providing our customers with an enterprise view of their critical supply relationships. Supply chain catalyst combines our Orbis database with customers' internal data to deliver an integrated view of risk across multiple tiers of their supply chain and taking into account factors like financial health and sustainability and reputational risk among others.\nAnd finally, we continue to focus on serving our people, our customers and our communities. Our DE&I initiatives have received some great external recognition, helping to distinguish Moody's as an employer of choice. And that has never been more important than right now.\nIn addition to the accolades that you see on this slide, we were just notified of our inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the second year in a row. And for the 11th year running, we're very proud to have received a perfect score from the Corporate Equality Index.\nAnd on top of these awards, we've achieved recognition from customers for our products and services. And among many other awards, we were named the best credit rating agency by Institutional Investor for the 10th straight year and we're ranked #2 overall in the Charters RiskTech 100.\nNow switching to our segment results, beginning with MIS. Favorable market conditions contributed to our strongest year yet in terms of both revenue and rated issuance. And investment-grade supply moderated off what was really a record 2020, but volumes were still substantial. Meanwhile, the leveraged loan market rebounded sharply, and it was bolstered by low default rates and an uptick in private equity buyout activity as well as increased investor appetite for floating rate debt amid higher inflation.\nStrong leveraged loan volumes also supported some very strong CLO growth. And more broadly, structured finance issuance rebounded, and that was due to ongoing favorable market conditions, including tight spreads, and that drove both new CLO as well as refinancing activity and CMBS and RMBS issuance in particular.\nAs we consider the issuance drivers and factors for the year ahead, broadly speaking, the economy has demonstrated resilience to the impact of Omicron. GDP is growing. Companies are performing well and job creation continues, all of which underpin business, investor and consumer confidence.\nBut there are headwinds. Inflation remains elevated amidst supply chain constraints in tight labor markets, although we expect price pressures to abate over the course of the year, but still uncertainty around the future path of interest rates may invite some occasional bouts of market volatility. And we've certainly seen that in the start of the year. Historically, a rising interest rate environment, when associated with robust economic activity, has been a positive for MIS. And I think it's worth noting that even with the potential for interest rate increases this year, overall, financing rates will remain at very modest levels from a historical perspective. We forecasted tight spreads, M&A transactions, ongoing refinancing needs and disintermediation will support global debt activity above medium-term historical levels, but with issuance slightly moderating versus record levels in 2021. And Mark is going to provide some details on MIS 2022 issuance expectations later in the call.\nNow moving to Moody's Analytics. In 2021, MA's revenue grew by 16%. We also meaningfully increased the mix of recurring revenue, which now represents 93% of MA's total revenue. And underpinning this performance, were 9% organic revenue growth, supported by a 95% retention rate, over 2,000 new customer accounts added through a combination of global sales execution and acquisitions and targeted investments in high-priority markets. And this momentum gives us the confidence to capitalize on the strong demand and market opportunities across MA by continuing to invest both organically and inorganically. And we're doing just that.\nIn 2021, with a purposeful acceleration in the fourth quarter, we invested to enhance and fast track the launch of several product offerings. For instance, in the fourth quarter, we acquired Passport and invested to accelerate our integration with the goal of significantly advancing the development of our customer screening and onboarding capabilities. By digitizing and automating the KYC and AML process for our customers, we're providing a streamlined workflow along with data from our Orbis and grid databases. And we're building an efficient and effective interconnected suite of tools that deliver a stronger value proposition for customers in what is still a relatively fragmented market.\nWe also continue to build product capabilities in commercial real estate. I've previously talked about a product launch in the third quarter, credit lens for commercial real estate. And that's our SaaS workflow platform built on the latest cloud technology and tailored to the specific needs of commercial real estate lenders.\nIn the fourth quarter, we accelerated the road map for enhancements to the platform, including the overall user experience. We also expedited the launch of our portfolio monitoring solution for commercial real estate investors, integrating and building on the acquisition of realxdata in September, and this solution -- commercial real estate portfolio manager was recently made available to customers in North America.\nAnd last, we invested in the ongoing SaaS conversion of our banking software products, which supports growth among our existing customers and will help deepen our penetration of the midsized financial institution sector. And we expect that this conversion will raise our recurring revenue growth rate to low double digits in 2022 and low teens in 2023.\nWith 24% overall sales growth, including 20% increase in our organic recurring sales, we demonstrated significant traction with customers in these 3 segments. This strong sales growth, along with our financial capacity, gave us the confidence to invest opportunistically in the fourth quarter in these areas.\nFor the broader MA business, we're also making some foundational investments, which will support both revenue growth and operating efficiency. In the fourth quarter, we made investments in integrating RMS, which we'll touch on shortly, as well as fine-tuning our sales capabilities to deepen customer penetration, expand cross-selling and refine our go-to-market approach.\nNow as you can see on this slide, our organic recurring revenue growth rate has steadily improved, and we anticipate it's going to continue to do so and contribute towards our goal of achieving total revenue growth in the low to mid-teens percent range within 5 years. And this focus on organic recurring revenue expansion is at the core of our business strategy for MA.\nThere are also some other drivers that underpin this medium-term outlook. We're redoubling our focus on customer satisfaction to support our strong retention rates and help us support recurring revenue growth. Our product enhancements enable us to increase revenue per customer from cross-selling upgrades and pricing opportunities. The continued transition to SaaS and our Enterprise Risk Solutions segment provides the opportunity for revenue uplift from existing customers as well as the opportunity to add new customers. And we're also prioritizing the development of products and solutions for existing and new customers to further tailor our solutions to their unique needs.\nNow last year on our fourth quarter earnings call, we talked about the use cases that we're serving across what was at the time a $35 billion addressable market opportunity. Now we've since expanded that to $40 billion by adding RMS. And given the demand to assess a wider range of risks, many of these markets are growing quickly, which, as you can see on the right, translated into 4 areas in MA where we generated over $100 million in organic recurring revenue with double-digit growth rates.\nAnd this leads me to our acquisition of RMS. And though it's early in the integration process, in meeting with a number of C-suite executives at insurance and reinsurance companies, I got to tell you I'm excited about the opportunity to serve the insurance industry with a broader array of risk assessment offerings as well as leveraging RMS' world-class data and models and expertise to meet our customers' growing needs around disaster and climate risk.\nWe have aligned and cross-trained our sales teams, and the SaaS migration is ongoing at RMS. Most importantly, the feedback from RMS and Moody's insurance customers has been overwhelmingly positive. They're excited about us jointly providing more comprehensive offerings for both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet, and we're identifying opportunities for new products that evaluate weather and climate risks to take to the broader Moody's customer base, particularly in commercial real estate, CMBS and banking.\nTo bring this to life, I want to highlight a recent example of a large P&C insurer, which has been a customer of both RMS and to a lesser extent, MA, for years. I met with them recently to talk about how we can be even more of a strategic partner for them. And we discussed how they wanted to integrate ESG considerations into a range of processes that included underwriting, investment, regulatory compliance, scenario analysis, portfolio management. And ultimately, the breadth of our offerings and our ability to integrate them in ways that provide a more consistent view of ESG risk across the enterprise, and especially for climate change, really differentiated our offerings. And this cross-sell was enabled by the very deep RMS relationship and combined with the broader Moody's ESG capabilities. And I think it's a great example of the kinds of conversations that we're having with many RMS and Moody's insurance customers about how we can enable a consistent view of risk to support profitable growth, lower insured losses and reduced volatility.\nI'm now going to turn the call over to Mark to provide further details on Moody's fourth quarter results as well as our full year 2022 and medium-term outlook.\n\nMark Bradley Kaye\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Moody's Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. In the fourth quarter, MIS revenue grew 19%, supported by a 28% increase in transaction revenue as rated issuance rose 23%. Corporate Finance was the largest contributor to revenue, growing 20%, supported by a 21% increase in issuance. This is driven by demand for leveraged loans as issuers opportunistically refinance debt and funded M&A. Heightened investment-grade activity also contributed to growth, while high-yield bonds declined due to a pivot to floating rate debt.\nStructured finance revenue registered its strongest quarter in a decade as revenue and issuance grew 66% and 148%, respectively. Investors' search for yield and favorable market conditions, including historically tight spreads drove activity across all major structured finance asset classes.\nFinancial institutions revenue increased 6% as issuance grew 22%, while frequent U.S. and European bank issuers took advantage of the attractive rate and spread environment.\nPublic project and infrastructure finance revenue declined 2% despite a 24% decrease in issuance. Non-U.S. infrastructure finance activity was offset by lower U.S. public finance and EMEA sub-sovereign issuance as financing needs were largely addressed in prior quarters.\nThe MIS adjusted operating margin expanded over 500 basis points to 53.6%. Robust business performance resulted in higher incentive compensation, which impacted the margin by approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to MA. Fourth quarter revenue grew 20% or 7% on an organic constant currency basis. RD&A revenue increased 12% as we benefited from high demand for KYC and compliance solutions as well as credit research and data feeds. Revenue was further supported by record retention rates of 96%, level with the prior year period. ERS revenue was up 42% and fueled by the acquisition of RMS with recurring revenue comprising 89% of total revenue, up from 81%. For full year 2021, U.S. organic constant currency recurring revenue grew by 9% as we executed on our strategic shift away from onetime sales.\nMA's adjusted operating margin of 14.9% reflected the impact of recent acquisitions, higher incentive compensation and the intentional pull forward and acceleration of select organic product investments into the fourth quarter. Excluding these 3 items, MA's adjusted operating margin expanded by over 100 basis points. The increased investment in high-growth markets and product development directly supports our expectation for organic recurring revenue growth in the low double-digit percent range in 2022.\nThis slide provides further insight into our operating expenses for both full year 2021 and our outlook for 2022 as we balance cost efficiencies with investments to accelerate future growth. For full year 2021, operating expenses rose 13%. Of this, 7 percentage points were attributable to operational and transaction-related costs associated with acquisitions during the year. Organic strategic investments related to product innovation and technology initiatives contributed another 5 percentage points.\nIn addition, we invested in our employees. Operating growth, which is primarily comprised of hiring, annual wage increases and other retention-oriented spending as well as higher incentive compensation accruals contributed to an aggregate 6 percentage point increase. This cost was directly offset through a combination of ongoing cost efficiency programs and lower severance and restructuring-related charges. For full year 2022, we forecast expenses to increase in the low double-digit percent range, mostly attributable to acquisitions completed within the last 12 months. We expected incremental spending on organic strategic investments and operating growth, primarily related to merit and promotional increases as well as talent acquisition and retention will be balanced through savings from lower incentive compensation accruals and ongoing expense discipline and efficiency initiatives.\n2021 provided a unique opportunity to accelerate our investments in high-growth markets, including KYC, SRE, banking, ESG, emerging markets as well as technology enablement. We ultimately invested approximately $150 million to enhance our capabilities and capture new opportunities for revenue expansion across the business. We expect to sustain this level of investment in 2022 as we execute on our long-term integrated risk assessment strategy.\nFinally, we also plan to invest over $50 million in 2022 on our most important asset, our people. Our employees connect deeply to our mission to provide trusted insights and standards that help decision-makers act with confidence. And we want to attract and retain the best talent in order to achieve our growth ambitions.\nTurning now to our corporate guidance for 2022. Moody's outlook for the year is based on assumptions regarding many geopolitical conditions, macroeconomic and capital market factors. These include, but are not limited to, the effects of interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market as well as the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent responses by governments, regulators, businesses and individuals. The outlook also reflects assumptions regarding general economic conditions, the company's own operations and personnel as well as additional items detailed in the earnings release.\nOur full year 2022 guidance incorporates the following specific macro assumptions. 2022 U.S. and Euro [area] GDP will each expand by approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, and global benchmark interest rates will gradually rise with the U.S. high-yield spreads moving slightly above the historical average of approximately 500 basis points. By year-end, the U.S. unemployment rate will decline to about 3.5% and the global high-yield default rate will gradually decrease before gradually rising to approximately 2.4%. Global inflation is projected to decline over the course of 2022 yet remain above Central Bank targets in several countries.\nOur guidance also assumes foreign currency translation. Specifically, our forecast for 2022 reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.35 and $1.14 for the euro. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook.\nIn 2022, we expect Moody's revenue to increase in the high single-digit percent range in operating expenses, including the full year impact of acquisitions to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Moody's adjusted operating margin is forecast to be in the range of 49% to 50%. We estimate net interest expense to be between $200 million and $220 million and the full year 2022 effective tax rate to be between 20.5% and 22.5%. Diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS are projected to be in the range of $11.50 to $12 and $12.40 to $12.90 respectively.\nFree cash flow is forecast to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, and we plan to return at least $1.5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases, subject to available cash, market conditions M&A opportunities and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Included within this outlook is our intention to execute a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of the year. For a full list of our guidance, please refer to Table 12 of our earnings release.\nTurning now to our issuance outlook. We expect total MIS-rated issuance to decrease in the low single-digit percent range compared to record activity in the prior year. However, 2022 activity is anticipated to remain well above the prior 5-year historical average of $5.1 trillion inclusive of record issuance in 2021. We project that investment-grade activity will increase by approximately 15% following the sharp contraction in 2021. While funding conditions for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds will remain supportive, we estimate that issuance will decline by approximately 10% and 15%, respectively. This is due to strong prior year comparables and an expected decrease in opportunistic activity, particularly in high yield as global benchmark rates rise.\nWe forecast a 5% increase in public project and infrastructure finance activity and that financial institution issuance will be approximately flat. After a year of robust structured finance activity, issuance is expected to decline by approximately 5%.\nFor 2022, we estimate 900 to 1,000 first-time mandates, which will contribute to both transaction revenue and future recurring revenue growth. We expect MIS' full year revenue to increase in the low single-digit percent range, reflecting both our strong new mandate estimate and recurring revenue base, which will offset a moderation in issuance. We forecast MIS' adjusted operating margin to be approximately 62%, in line with the prior full year result. This is an improvement of more than 400 basis points since 2020 due to operational efficiency and expense discipline.\nTurning to MA. We anticipate revenue will increase in the high teens percent range, building on strong 10% growth in organic constant currency recurring revenue in 2021. This reflects our ongoing focus on expanding our subscription-based products and is further supported by approximately 10 percentage points attributable to previously announced acquisitions. We forecast MA's adjusted operating margin to be approximately 29%, inclusive of 150 to 200 basis point headwind from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange movements.\nAs Rob mentioned earlier, in response to investor feedback, we are replacing our existing long-term targets with new medium-term guidance. This demonstrates our commitment to delivering multiyear value to our stakeholders as well as our confidence in capitalizing on the growth opportunities available to us while maintaining an attractive margin profile over the next 5 years.\nFor MIS, we project revenue to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percent range, coupled with an adjusted operating margin in the low 60% range. as we continue to invest in meeting our customers' needs in emerging markets and evolving areas of risk, including ESG.\nFor MA, we are targeting revenue in the low to mid-teens percent range and an adjusted operating margin in the mid-30% range within 5 years. We expect this increase to be driven by organic investments in our products, solutions and distribution capabilities as well as operating leverage from expanding recurring revenue. As such, over the coming 5 years, we project Moody's revenue to grow by at least 10% on an average annualized basis and adjusted operating margin to stabilize in the low 50s percent range. We also anticipate that adjusted diluted EPS will increase in the low double-digit percent range.\nBefore turning the call back over to Rob, I would like to highlight a few key takeaways. First, in 2021, Moody's delivered over $6 billion in revenue and an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate above 20% as our customer-centric approach continue to address their evolving needs. Second, following a record year of issuance in 2021, we expect activity to remain robust this year. Third, MA's high recurring revenue growth and retention rates will continue to support strong financial results. Fourth, our strategic investments in high-growth markets will strengthen our financial performance in 2022. And finally, the introduction of medium-term targets reflects our conviction in the momentum of our business as well as our commitment to capitalize on multiple opportunities for growth.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Rob.\n\nRobert Scott Fauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Moody's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. And before we take questions, I again just want to recognize the efforts of all of our people at Moody's. Our entire organization remains focused on putting our customers at the center of everything that we do. And in 2022 and beyond, we're going to continue to invest and to execute to provide our customers the solutions they want to need to manage a wider range of interconnected risk, and that will reinforce our medium-term growth opportunity.\nSo thanks for listening to our prepared remarks. Before we go to Q&A, I've been asked to give a brief public service announcement about our Investor Day. We're going to be sharing some videos that spotlight various parts of Moody's leading up to the event. So stay tuned for that, and we look forward to seeing everybody on March 10. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and Mark and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

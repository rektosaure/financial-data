Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter Fiscal '26 Earnings Call. I'm Debbie Hancock, Lamb Weston's Vice President of Investor Relations. Earlier today, we issued our press release and posted slides that we will use for our discussion today. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on our current expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results.\nYou can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release and the appendix to our presentation. Joining me today are Mike Smith, our President and CEO; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Lamb Weston team delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and show commercial momentum in our business. While we are early in our focus to win execution, we are energized and excited by the emerging evidence of results coming from the foundation that we began to lay earlier this calendar year. Our goal remains to drive profitable growth and win with customers by focusing on the principles that made Lamb Weston the industry gold standard, category-leading innovation, exceptional products and customer-centric actions.\nWe are early in the journey, but our North Star is clear. I want to thank our hard-working team globally for their excellent work. Let me provide a few key messages I would like to leave with you today. First, we delivered another quarter of strong volume growth. This is a result of excellent work across our organization from innovation, quality, consistency and our focus on the customer. We are seeing positive customer momentum as we invest behind strategic differentiators.\nSecond, we are acting with urgency to implement our new strategic plan, Focus to Win, including working to deliver our cost savings program, which is in the early innings, but tracking to our plan of achieving at least $250 million of annual run rate savings by fiscal year-end 2028.\nThird, we have new innovative products coming this fall, and we are winning new business and growing with existing customers as our teams go to market with a more customer-centric Lamb Weston organization. Fourth, in response to sustained volume growth in North America, we are restarting a curtailed line. Lastly, we are acting with urgency to position Lamb Weston for long-term success and shareholder value creation, including by prioritizing the specific markets and products where we believe we have a sustainable competitive advantage.\nNow let's discuss the quarter in more detail. Our first quarter results were led by volume growth in both segments. Price mix within our expectations, the benefits of our cost savings initiatives and significant progress in improving working capital, reducing our capital investments and driving strong free cash flow generation.\nAs we roll out our Focus to Win strategy and drive operational and strategic changes across our business, we are doing so from a leadership position within a category of opportunity, whether at home or away from home, let's take a minute to remind ourselves why fries. Traditional French fries are one of the most profitable items on restaurant menus. Fries are the most ordered item at U.S. restaurants. They appeal to a broad range of consumers in our America's favorite order across every generation. The fry attachment rate or how often someone order fries with their meal remains approximately 2 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.\nWhat that means is that when people go out to eat, they are ordering fries more often than in 2019. And we see positive trends around the globe. For example, global demand is growing with an estimated 44% of global menus offering fries. And as multinational and local market QSRs expand, they continue to see developing markets with fries, which is trending positive.\nFinally, global fry volume growth has outpaced total food growth versus 2019. In July, we launched Focus to Win, our new strategic plan to unlock near and long-term value. And while it is early in our efforts, we are making progress. I see it in the focus our teams have and the decisions we are making. We have clearly identified savings plans and our teams are executing. All this is happening as we work to be our customers' #1 partner, a world-class potato company and an industry-leading innovator.\nLooking at each of the pillars of our strategy. A few early examples include: within strengthening customer partnerships, we have realigned our sales teams around our priority markets. In North America, we are augmenting our successful direct sales force with a broker model to expand our reach into underpenetrated channels of the business. The Lamb Weston organization is embracing a customer-centric mentality. We have secured several new wins around the world, including expanding our share in business in key away-from-home categories such as C-stores and Cash & Carry. And outside the U.S., we've increased our business with QSR customers.\nIn terms of executional excellence, the supply chain organization is elevating Lamb Weston's operations. We have undertaken programs across manufacturing, logistics and procurement that are not just driving cost savings but meaningfully improving our run rates, our quality and our customer satisfaction metrics. In response to sustained volume growth in North America, as previously mentioned, we are restarting a curtailed mine in the latter part of the second quarter to ensure we maintain strong customer fill rates. Our global footprint and the untapped capacity in our manufacturing network allows us to take on new business and provide additional support for our customers.\nAdditionally, we began shipping from our new manufacturing facility in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Approximately 80% of production will be destined for export, primarily for Latin America, including Brazil. Finally, setting the pace for innovation. We take great pride in our position as an innovation leader, and we are working to directly improve the customer and consumer experience, drive breakthrough innovations and innovate how we operate.\nAs I mentioned in July, we've established global innovation hubs to orchestrate disruptive innovation platforms, one in North America and one in the Netherlands for our international markets. This fall, we are launching exciting new products into retail that are aligned with customer trends. This includes flavor-forward offerings from Alexia such as garlic and Parmesan crinkle-cut fries, and dill pickle season fries as well as expanding our licensed brands with Paw Patrol [ waffle ] fries and shaped tops.\nAnd internationally, we continue the rollout of our really crunchy artisanal fries, which are performing exceptionally well. Before Bernadette provides a more in-depth review of the quarter, let's discuss the upcoming potato crop. We're harvesting and processing crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe. Currently, we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are above historical average and in the Midwest are near average as growing conditions in all regions have remained generally favorable.\nIn Europe, growing conditions in the industry's main growing regions of the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Germany have also been favorable, leading to an above-average yield forecast for the region. We continue to expect our potato costs in Europe to be flat to slightly lower than the previous year's fixed price contracts. As a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a mid-single-digit percent decrease in the aggregate in contract prices for the 2025 potato crop.\nWe expect to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning late in our fiscal second quarter. We'll provide our final assessment of the potato crops in North America and Europe when we report our second quarter results. I will now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the quarter and our outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our teams continue to perform at a high level as we began executing our new strategic plan and driving changes across the organization. In the quarter, we grew volumes, improved our manufacturing cost per pound and delivered strong cash flow. Starting on Slide 11. First quarter net sales were essentially flat, increasing $5 million, including a $24 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation. .\nOn a constant currency basis, net sales declined 1% compared with the prior year. Volume increased 6%, driven by customer wins and retention, led primarily by gains in North America and Asia. In North America, the rate of new customer volume scaled earlier than we planned. The total volume increase also included lapping an approximately $15 million charge taken in the first quarter of fiscal '25 related to a voluntary product withdrawal.\nTurning to the industry. Restaurant traffic at several customer channels was flat in the quarter, including overall QSR traffic, while some are growing, including QSR chicken, QSR hamburger, however, was down low single digits and declined another percent in August. Restaurant traffic outside the U.S. has been mixed. Traffic in certain markets, including the U.K., our largest international market, declined 4%. Our customers continue to lean into value and menu innovation, including limited time offerings to drive traffic and meet consumer needs. Price/mix at constant currency rates was in line with our expectations, declining 7% compared with the prior year.\nAs a reminder, this includes the carryover impact of fiscal 2025 price and trade investments that went into effect in the second quarter of last year as well as ongoing support of our customers. It also includes unfavorable channel product mix within our segments. Looking at our segments. North America net sales declined 2% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower net selling prices. Price/mix declined 7% and volume increased 5%, supported by recent customer contract wins and growth across channels.\nIn our International segment, net sales increased 4%, including a favorable $24 million impact from foreign currency translation. At constant currency rates, net sales were flat. Volume grew 6% in the quarter and price mix at constant currency rates declined 6%. This was primarily related to pricing actions in key international markets to support our customers. Our international segment remains well positioned for the long term, supported by new modern manufacturing facilities, a broad and innovative portfolio and an expanding global footprint.\nIn the first quarter, Asia, including China, led our volume growth, reflecting solid market performance. Growth was supported primarily by contributions from multinational chains. In Europe, we expect that a strong crop, soft restaurant market demand and increased competitive actions will continue to pressure price mix for the balance of the year. And in Latin America, we began shipping from our new facility in Argentina in early second quarter.\nWhile we are actively onboarding customers, we expect it will take time before the facility reaches target utilization levels. We've seen competitive activity increase in Latin America, most notably in Brazil.\nMoving on from sales. As expected, on Slide 12, you can see that adjusted gross profit declined. This was primarily due to unfavorable price mix. This was partially offset by higher sales volume and a decrease in manufacturing cost per pound due primarily to benefits from our cost savings initiatives and the benefit of lapping an approximately $39 million charge in the prior year related to a voluntary product withdrawal.\nWe're pleased with the progress we're making against our cost savings initiatives, and we remain on track to deliver fiscal 2026 savings targets. Our broader goal with our manufacturing initiatives, however, is to embed sustainable process improvements that will continue to enhance our manufacturing performance beyond the immediate efficiencies we are seeing. Partially offsetting these benefits was about $15 million of increased fixed factory burden absorption and about $4 million of incremental costs related to the start-up of the new production facility in Argentina.\nWhile we anticipated a decline in gross profit this quarter, the decline was less than expected due primarily to stronger than anticipated sales volumes and incremental benefits realized from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted SG&A declined $24 million versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects benefits from cost savings initiatives, -- it also includes $7 million of miscellaneous income primarily related to an insurance recovery and property tax refunds that will not repeat in future quarters.\nEquity method investments were a loss of $600,000 in the quarter, down from earnings of $11 million in the prior year quarter. This reflects the current lower rate of sales volume from our equity affiliate at lower prices, but also an unfavorable mix of sales. As a result, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat with last year at $302 million. The favorable impact on net sales from currency translation was almost entirely offset by higher local currency expenses, particularly cost of sales in our global markets.\nTurning to segment EBITDA performance on Slide 13. Adjusted EBITDA in our North America segment declined 6% or $18 million versus the prior year quarter to $260 million, primarily related to price and trade investments in support of our customers, which was only partially offset by higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing cost per pound and lower adjusted SG&A. Lower manufacturing costs per pound and adjusted SG&A both benefited from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe also lapped an approximately $21 million charge for the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year. In our International segment, adjusted EBITDA increased $6 million to $57 million. This year-over-year improvement, primarily reflects the absence of last year's $18 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal, lower potato prices, cost savings from our cost savings initiatives, and a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.\nThese benefits were mostly offset by supporting our customers with price investments, increased competitive actions in certain markets and approximately $4 million of start-up costs associated with our new manufacturing facility in Argentina.\nMoving to liquidity and cash flows on Slide 14. Our liquidity and cash position remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $1.3 billion available under our revolving credit facility and $99 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our net debt was $3.9 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio was 3.1x on a trailing 12-month basis.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we generated $352 million of cash from operations, up $22 million versus the prior year quarter. Lower inventories were the primary driver of the increase. Free cash flow was strong at $273 million. As a reminder, our Focus to Win plan includes approximately $60 million of incremental cash flow from working capital, mainly from reducing inventory in both fiscal '26 and '27 or $120 million in total, we believe we're on track to deliver the fiscal '26 target.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter declined $256 million to $79 million as we completed our production facility expansion projects. For fiscal '26, our capital spending is expected to be approximately $500 million, with approximately $400 million in maintenance and modernization and $100 million for environmental projects, which are mostly for wastewater treatment.\nTurning to Slide 15. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $62 million to shareholders. This included $52 million in cash dividends, and we repurchased $10 million of stock, leaving us with $348 million authorized under the plan. This brings the total cash we've returned to shareholders since the spin in 2016 to over $2 billion.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to be anchored in investing in the business. Its capabilities and areas where we are working to competitively differentiate Lamb Weston to execute our business strategy, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders with dividends and share repurchases.\nLet's turn to our outlook on Slide 16. We are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2026. As a reminder, this outlook includes the contribution of a 53rd week with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect revenue at constant currency rates in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.55 billion, which is a 2% decline to 2% increase.\nWe expect year-over-year volume growth behind customer momentum in both segments. In our North America segment, we expect volume to grow in both the first and second half of the year. Note that while volumes in the first quarter came in above expectations, this reflects the acceleration of new customer activity that we planned for in later periods.\nIn our International segment, we expect volume in the back half of the year to be essentially flat as we lap the new customer acquisitions from the prior year, and we continue operating in a competitive environment. We also continue to anticipate price mix will be unfavorable at constant currency. As of the end of the quarter, we have secured approximately 75% of our global open contract volume at pricing levels generally consistent with expectations.\nAs anticipated, unfavorable price mix will be more pronounced in the first half, reflecting the carryover pricing actions from fiscal '25. The effect is expected to moderate in the second half of the year, supported by new contracts signed this year. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range remains at $1 billion to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA now excludes noncash share-based compensation expense. It is available in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that accompanied the earnings release we filed this morning.\nDespite the outperformance in first quarter, with only 1 quarter behind us, we believe it's prudent to maintain our guidance range. While we previously excluded any impact from tariffs, the range now incorporates tariffs in the balance of the year based on our latest view of enacted tariffs by the U.S. and other governments. Additionally, given the outperformance of the first quarter's gross profit from higher-than-planned volume, we expect gross profit margins in the second quarter to be relatively flat with the first quarter, due primarily to as expected, first quarter input cost inflation being flat to slightly down compared with a year ago due to the steep increase in open market potato prices in Europe in the prior year.\nGoing forward, beginning in the second quarter, we expect low single-digit inflation, including the benefit of this year's lower raw potato prices. We also expect higher factory burden from longer-than-expected planned maintenance downtime at one of our plants and additional startup expenses and factory burden absorption related to the start-up of Argentina planned to adversely affect our margin performance in our International segment in the second quarter.\nTurning to adjusted SG&A. Our first quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was lower than our expectation for the full year. As I previously mentioned, the quarter included $7 million of miscellaneous income that will not repeat in future quarters. In addition, at year-end, we shared our plan to invest approximately $10 million of SG&A in innovation, advertising and promotion expenses to support our long-term strategic plan.\nThese investments are slated through the remainder of the year. While not in our guidance, the net sales and adjusted EBITDA, we are updating our tax rate guidance from approximately 26% to a range of 26% to 27%. We now expect the tax rate in the first half to be in the low 30s and the second half expectation remains in the low 20s.\nWe do not expect that the recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation will have a material impact on our fiscal 2026 tax rate. And finally, our outlook reflects the progress we are making with our customers, the cost savings. We are on track to deliver and the early but positive results of the work by our team to execute focus to win within a competitive market. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Bernadette. In closing, we are acting with urgency to execute our focus doing strategy, including delivering our cost savings program. We have continued to drive strong volume growth and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our customers. Our team is focused on improving capital efficiency and increasing cash flows as our growth investments are complete and reducing working capital.\nWe have trend forward products coming to the market and the capacity and innovation to partner with our customers, and we are managing our business strategically, deploying resources and focusing our efforts in the areas of the market where we have the most differentiation, which we are confident will best position us for sustained success. Finally, we've reaffirmed our outlook for fiscal '26. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. I'm Debbie Hancock, Lamb Weston's Vice President of Investor Relations.\nEarlier today, we issued our press release and posted slides that we will use for our discussion today. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on our current expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release and the appendix to our presentation.\nJoining me today are Mike Smith, our President and CEO; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I first want to thank our Lamb Weston team around the globe for their hard work and strong execution.\nFiscal 2025 was a year of substantial change for Lamb Weston. In addition to me becoming CEO, we recently added significant new and relevant experience to the Board with 6 new members, including a new Chairman, Bradley Alford, as well as Laurence Cursius; Paul Mace; Timothy McLevish; Ruth Kimmelshue and Scott Osfeld. Management and the new Board have a high sense of urgency and are aligned on capitalizing on the many opportunities we collectively see to drive results in our business.\nToday's results evidence the momentum we continue to build with customers and the visibility we have in our business as we work to rebuild credibility with investors. We are focused on controlling what we can control and are taking advantage of opportunities to drive results and improve execution through a cost savings program we announced today, along with our customer-centric Focus to Win strategy for long-term success. Successful execution of these plans will help drive improved performance, including free cash flow and long-term returns.\nTo drive further alignment along with sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and returns on capital have been added to our compensation plans for fiscal 2026 -- this alignment continues at the Board level, which for 2026, the Board has unanimously elected to receive their compensation in equity in the company. We believe these cumulative actions are readying the organization to further support customers and accelerate our performance when demand returns to growth.\nTurning to business results. Lamb Weston ended the year with momentum and customer wins and retention, delivering results ahead of our updated expectations for fiscal 2025. The team is executing at a high level and our long-standing commitment to quality, service and innovation is driving success with customers globally.\nWe had a strong fourth quarter that came in above our expectations. Volume was up with wins across channels and geographies and net sales grew. Price/mix declined reflecting our support of customers with price and trade as we manage the competitive environment and soft restaurant traffic. We're also seeing the benefits of our cost savings in our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA increased in the quarter, and we made significant progress in improving working capital.\nFor the full year, our success in the second half enabled us to end the year with volume up. As discussed on earlier calls, our full year profit was impacted by actions to support customers in a competitive environment, higher costs from production curtailments and higher inventories during the year as well as inflationary pressures. We offset some of this impact by delivering slightly above our cost savings target, with $59 million of savings for the year.\nSince January, when I took on the role of CEO, I've worked closely with the Board and management team to drive change with urgency and better position our business for success. Over the past several months and with the support of outside resources, we undertook an end-to-end assessment of our operations. We developed a strategic plan to drive targeted decision-making and actions and we are now executing on a plan to unlock near and long-term value.\nThis plan, which we call Focus to Win includes zero-based budgeting, assessing our noncore assets and augmenting our commercial go-to-market. We are already making progress. You can see in our better-than-expected results announced today, but we know that the work and the real opportunities are ahead of us. We are operating in an industry with rapidly changing dynamics in a global consumer environment that remains uncertain. It requires a new approach, a Focus to Win.\nGlobal demand for French fries remain strong, but the market dynamics are evolving in important ways: growth in food delivery, expanding QSR concepts and air fryers changing how we cook at home are creating an opportunity that demands innovation and new approaches. Geographic growth is greatest in emerging markets where margin profiles are lower but also where QSR formats are expanding.\nAnd following market shortages during COVID, the long-term attractiveness of our industry has created the potential for future supply-demand imbalance, most notably outside the U.S. As previously discussed, while new capacity has been announced globally, we do not expect at all to be built. We have already begun to see industry consolidation and decisions to postpone or cancel capacity additions. We believe these postponements and cancellations could continue as the industry has been rational over time.\nImportantly, not all new capacity is created equal, geographic exposure, capabilities, reliability of raw material sourcing and quality to determine the markets and channels impacted by new capacity. We believe that much of the new capacity in developing markets like India and the Middle East does not have the capability to produce higher-margin premium items, which is the strategic focus for Lamb Weston.\nWe believe the work we performed on the market confirmed our right to win in our key geographies, segments and product categories. We are operating in some of the lowest cost potato-growing regions and we are investing in capabilities aligned to growth opportunities and to our customers' needs to win and grow profitably over time.\nLet's talk about our Focus to Win strategy. To differentiate Lamb Weston in today's market, we are defining where to play through a strategic framework that focuses our resources and efforts on the most attractive growth opportunities across markets, channels and product segments. How we expect to win is targeted, strengthen our customer partnerships, execute with excellence and set the pace for innovation.\nWe are creating a repeatable cycle with four elements that drive growth and profitability for Lamb Weston. First, we are focusing investments on priority global markets and segments. Second, we are strengthening customer partnerships. Third, we are achieving executional excellence. And finally, we are setting the pace for innovation. We'll talk more about these shortly. But at the core, we will do what our team does better than anyone else -- be our customer's #1 partner, a world-class potato company and an industry-leading innovator. Our focus will be on geographies, channels and products where we can both differentiate and lead.\nWe've built our business, in part by being something for everyone. But going forward, we will continue to partner with excellence in our core markets. We will invest to grow in markets, channels and product categories with more attractive profit opportunities where customers value our full product and service offerings. We will focus our resources on markets and segments where we have the greatest advantage and reevaluate noncore assets and markets. We will close the capability gaps in our organization and we will target premium market segments where innovation is a differentiator.\nWe must transform how we operate. It is how we will win. First, strengthen customer partnerships. Lamb Weston remains a partner of choice for our customers. Our third-party research confirms that our value relationships and service are best-in-class. Our opportunity is to expand what we've done with our largest customers to our priority customer targets and geographies, enhancing our joint business planning activities and capabilities. Second, achieve executional excellence. To be a partner of choice for our customers and to successfully and profitably operate in an increasingly competitive market, everything we do, we must do with excellence across all functions of the company.\nFor example, in supply chain, we are focused on operating an advantaged global footprint aligned to our growth plan with a streamlined distribution network and revamped continuous improvement team with a focus on plant productivity. This includes simplifying and standardizing operations across locations, driving OEE improvement via our Lamb Weston manufacturing operating culture and embedding a 0-loss mindset in raw potato and materials usage.\nFinally, to differentiate in a competitive marketplace with changing customer preferences, we must continue Lamb Weston's long track record of being an innovation leader. Our innovation efforts have delivered incremental improvements that directly enhance the customer and consumer experience. Looking ahead, we're expanding our invention to include breakthrough innovations such as Lamb Weston Fast Fries that allow operators in nontraditional fried channels to provide customers with fast and crispy fry offerings. These customers unlock new sources of value in channels that don't traditionally serve fries, this next chapter broadens our innovation efforts beyond product level and into areas such as process technology.\nFinally, we have created global innovation hubs to orchestrate disruptive innovation platforms. We believe this will create a global network of insights and innovation specialists centered on 2 innovation hubs, North America and International. In concert with these plans and as part of our Focus to Win strategy, today, we announced cost savings that are designed to better align our organization with the environment, improve efficiency and focus on our biggest opportunities.\nWe have identified at least $250 million of annualized run rate savings that we expect to achieve by the end of fiscal 2028, that Bernadette will talk about more in a moment. We believe these actions will lower our cost base and help ensure we remain competitive while reallocating resources on a more targeted basis to invest for growth. As I've discussed, customer and consumer preferences for our products remain high. Though execution in this period of macro uncertainty will be paramount to the future success of the company. We must control what we can control to continue delivering best-in-class returns on our business.\nThis includes streamlining our organization, implementing zero-based budgeting and strategically investing to improve productivity and strengthen our manufacturing network, but we also should not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that Lamb Weston will be poised to deliver for our customers with an improved cost structure and operations.\nWhen our customers see increased demand in their business, we don't know exactly when that will be, but when it does happen, we have confidence that it will, and we will be well positioned to win when it does.\nI'll now turn it over to Bernadette to review the fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and walk through our outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking our teams for their hard work in fiscal '25 as we navigated a challenging year.\nHalfway through the year, we made important changes to adapt to the evolving environment and put our business on a path back to growth. Our fourth quarter results reflect the progress we made throughout the year to address the dynamic and changing environment. We delivered volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year, disciplined cost management and a focus on cash flow with significant working capital improvements and lower capital expenditures.\nLet's begin with our fourth quarter results on Slide 17. Net sales increased 4% compared with the prior year. Volume increased 8%, primarily driven by contract wins across each of our channels and geographic regions and lapping an approximate $22 million negative impact in the prior period from a previously announced voluntary products withdrawal.\nThese gains were partially offset by soft global restaurant traffic trends which were down low single digits in our largest markets of the U.S. and U.K. Despite lower traffic trends, there are some positive trends in the consumption data. In the U.S., French fries attachment rates continue to remain approximately 2 points higher than pre-pandemic levels. The French fry category grew 1% in the quarter and QSR fry serving sizes also increased 1%. Price/mix declined 4% in the quarter compared to the prior year reflecting efforts to support customers on price and trade in an increasingly competitive environment in both our North America and international segments.\nLooking at our segments. North America net sales declined 1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower net selling prices. Price mix in our North America segment declined 5% due to pricing actions to support our customers, which was only partially offset by favorable channel and product mix. The favorable mix was attributable to growth in higher margin regional small and retail customers.\nVolume increased 4%, primarily related to regional small and retail customer wins. These volume gains were partially offset by soft restaurant traffic. In the U.S., QSR traffic improved from February's level, but compared with the prior year was down 1% in the quarter and the fiscal year.\nTraffic at QSR chain specializing in hamburgers was down 2% in the quarter and 3% for the year. It's important to note that this is on top of declines in the prior year. Restaurant traffic on a 2-year stack is down mid-single digits with QSR hamburger focused restaurants, down high single digits over the 2-year period.\nFor our International segment, sales grew 15% versus the prior year quarter with little impact from foreign exchange. Despite restaurant traffic being down 3% in the U.K. our largest international market and relatively flat in key international markets. The international segment volume increased 16% driven primarily by recent customer contract wins and to a lesser extent, lapping the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year.\nPrice/mix declined 1%, reflecting pricing actions to support customers in key international markets in response to the continued competitive environment.\nMoving on from sales. As expected, adjusted gross profit declined compared with the prior year quarter, due primarily to first pricing actions to support our customers -- million of higher factory burden absorption. Specifically, fixed costs assigned to our curtailed lines are being temporarily absorbed by lower production levels, which leads to increased cost per pound.\nThird, low single-digit input cost inflation, including the benefit of lower raw potato prices. And finally, while not impacting EBITDA, higher depreciation expense from our recent capacity expansions. These actions were partially offset by increased sales volume and lapping the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year.\nAdjusted SG&A declined $16 million on lower advertising and promotional spend lapping of higher ERP transition expenses in the prior year as well as the benefit of our cost-saving initiatives. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $285 million which is essentially flat or up $2 million versus the prior year.\nLower adjusted SG&A offset lower adjusted gross profit and equity method earnings after adjustments for depreciation and amortization. Turning to segment EBITDA performance on Slide 19. Adjusted EBITDA in our North America segment declined 7% or $19 million versus the prior year quarter to $258 million, primarily related to pricing actions to support our customers and $17 million of incremental fixed factory burden absorption. This was only partially offset by lapping a $19 million charge for the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year and lower SG&A expenses.\nFor our International segment, adjusted EBITDA increased $22 million to $63 million. Higher net sales, lower manufacturing cost per pound, including lapping a $21 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year and lower SG&A offset the impact of a 1% decrease in price mix.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flows on Slide 20. We ended the year with approximately $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $1.17 billion available under our revolving credit facility and $71 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our net debt was $4.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio was 3.3x on a trailing 12-month basis.\nIn fiscal '25, we generated $86 million of cash from operations. This is up $70 million versus the prior year due primarily to $349 million of favorable changes in working capital, which was primarily attributable to lower inventories, which reduced 8 days and a favorable change in accrued liabilities.\nWe expect to continue to drive inventory improvements as part of our Focus to Win plan. This plan includes approximately $60 million of cash flow from inventory improvement in fiscal '26 and '27 or $120 million in total by the end of fiscal '27.\nTurning to Slide 21. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025, net of proceeds from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina were $651 million, down $323 million with our expansion projects nearing completion. We ended the year below our initial $750 million target due to continued capital discipline, cost savings initiatives and the timing of projects and cash outlays.\nFor fiscal '26, our capital spending is expected to be approximately $500 million with approximately $400 million in maintenance and modernization and $100 million for environmental projects, which are mostly for wastewater treatment.\nOn Slide 22, you can see that we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. For the year, we returned $489 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $100 million of shares and $282 million in the year, leaving us with $358 million available under the plan. We also returned $207 million in cash dividends during the year. We plan to continue to follow a disciplined capital allocation approach anchored around investment in the business, its capabilities and areas we are working to competitively differentiate Lamb Weston to execute our business strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders.\nLet's turn to our outlook. Starting with the potato crop on Slide 23. We started harvesting and processing the early potato varieties in North America, and initial indications are that this portion of the new crop is slightly above historical averages. At this time, the potato crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest, that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely within historical ranges as growing conditions in these regions have been favorable.\nAs a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a mid-single-digit decrease in the aggregate and contract prices for the 2025 potato crop. Because we ended the year with lower inventories, we expect that we will begin realizing the benefits of lower-cost potatoes harvested out of field in the second quarter of fiscal '26. This is earlier than last year and in line with historical seasonal timing.\nIn Europe, favorable dry and warm growing conditions in the industry's main growing regions of the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Germany are expected to result in an average crop. We currently expect our potato costs in Europe to be flat to slightly lower than the previous year's fixed price contracts. We will provide more details on the crops in both North America and Europe when we report our second quarter results.\nTurning to Slide 24 and our fiscal 2026 outlook. The outlook includes the contribution of a 53rd week with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter. In fiscal '26, we expect our category to continue to be in high demand with customers and consumers prioritizing French fries as a menu and an at-home item. However, our guidance assumes continued pressure on consumers from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Our outlook assumes no improvement in global restaurant traffic from fiscal '25 levels, but it does plan for customer momentum that began in the second half of fiscal '25 to continue.\nIt also does not include additional impacts of evolving trade policy, including changes in tariffs and retaliatory countermeasures. With this as a backdrop, we expect revenue for fiscal '26 in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.55 billion, which is a 2% decline to 2% growth on a constant currency basis. The carryover pricing actions we made in fiscal '25 to support our customers will have a negative impact on net sales in the first half of the year.\nBased on the timing of contract renewals, most of the fiscal '26 pricing actions will impact the second half of the year, and they are expected to have a lesser impact than those made in fiscal '25. In total, we expect sales to be stronger in the second half of the fiscal year, which will benefit from the additional week.\nTurning to our adjusted EBITDA outlook on Slide 25. Beginning in fiscal '26, we are implementing changes in our reporting of adjusted SG&A and adjusted EBITDA to fully exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. In fiscal '25, stock-based compensation expense was $40 million. After this call, we will publish a schedule recasting prior periods to reflect this new methodology on our investor website. With this change, we expect adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect adjusted gross profit to be down negatively impacted by the carryover pricing and further efforts to support customers with price and trade in fiscal '26.\nLow single-digit inflation, including the benefit of lower raw potato costs, and higher fixed factory burden and start-up costs in our International segment, primarily related to our new plant in Argentina, which is expected to begin producing sellable product in August. Before the benefits of our cost savings program, we expect adjusted SG&A will increase compared with the prior year due to an incremental $40 million headwind related to normalizing incentive compensation expenses after a couple of years of lower-than-planned incentive achievement and approximately $10 million of incremental investments, including, for example, innovation and advertising and promotion expenses to support our long-term strategic plan.\nOur adjusted gross margin and SG&A will benefit from the cost savings program that we announced today. We expect to deliver approximately $200 million of the full savings target by the end of fiscal '27 with about half on a run rate basis fiscal '26. In fiscal '26, we expect approximately 2/3 of the $100 million of savings to be realized in the second half of the year. About 2/3 will benefit adjusted gross profit and 1/3 will benefit adjusted SG&A this year.\nOver the program's life, however, we anticipate approximately 75% of the benefit in gross profit and 25% in SG&A. To deliver the savings, we expect to recognize approximately $70 million to $100 million of cash pretax charges, most of which are expected to be paid in fiscal '26. Keep in mind that these savings are on top of the remaining approximately $25 million of incremental benefits that we expect to deliver under the restructuring plan we announced in fiscal '25.\nAnd finally, adjusted EBITDA will benefit from the contribution of an additional week of sales and earnings. We are targeting a full year effective tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal '26, excluding the impact of comparability items. This tax rate is forecast to be in the high 20s in the first half of the year and low 20s in the second half of the year, reflecting the expected timing of discrete items most notably in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation to have a material impact on our fiscal 2016 tax rate.\nIn summary, Lamb Weston is operating from a strong financial foundation, and we believe the steps we announced today will enable us to improve our competitiveness and financial position through cost savings establishing clear strategic priorities and working capital improvements. We believe these expected savings, together with lower levels of capital expenditures and working capital improvements, will help drive improved profitability and cash flow over the long term.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Bernadette. I'm confident in the direction we are taking in Lamb Weston, and we are making important and significant changes to our business to compete more effectively in today's marketplace. We have organizational alignment to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. We will drive performance by focusing on the controllables, but we do so knowing it will provide an even bigger opportunity for us and our customers when restaurant traffic returns to growth, and we will be ready.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Earlier today, we issued our earnings press release and posted our slides that we'll use for today's call. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release in the appendix to our presentation.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me start with the leadership change we announced earlier today. As you've likely seen, I will be stepping down as CEO and Mike Smith, our current COO, will become Lamb Weston's next President and CEO beginning January 3, 2025.\nThe Board and I believe now is the right time to transition to allow a new leader to guide Lamb Weston into its next chapter of growth. And I could not be more thrilled to hand over the reins to Mike. His appointment represents the culmination of a thoughtful years-long succession planning process by the Board, and we are confident he is the right leader to guide Lamb Weston forward.\nOver the course of his 17-year career at Lamb Weston, Mike has developed a deep understanding of all critical aspects of our business and operational opportunities and driven growth across multiple areas of the company. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Mike and have witnessed firsthand his value-based leadership style and steadfast focus on people as well as his thorough understanding of the business. I'm confident that with Mike at the helm, Lamb Weston will drive profit and deliver value for our shareholders.\nNow turning to our results. Our second quarter performance was below our expectations and not what we aim to achieve at Lamb Weston. Slide 4 provides a snapshot of the key themes that we'll be discussing with you today. We expect the challenging operating environment will persist in the near term as weak restaurant traffic trends and additional capacity expansions announced by our competitors since our Investor Day last year, add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America.\nIn this new reality, we're evaluating opportunities beyond our initial restructuring plan to adjust our operations including reducing manufacturing and supply chain costs and operating expenses. In addition, we're evaluating opportunities to drive the top line by improving sales execution while also expanding our total addressable market by leveraging proprietary technologies to see nontraditional fry customers.\nAs we discussed on our last quarter's earnings call, we expect to significantly reduce our capital spending next year as we shift away from growth capital to focus on base, modernization and environmental capital. We expect these steps to increase our free cash flow, which would provide more flexibility to step up capital returns to our shareholders. We'll address each of these points during this call.\nLet me now turn it over to Bernadette to discuss details on our second quarter results.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, you can see that net sales declined 8% compared with the year ago quarter. Volume declined 6%, primarily driven by declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. and many of our key international markets. Customer share losses, net of gains, and the carryover impact of our decision last year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA to strategically manage customer and product mix.\nWhile the effects of these 3 factors were largely in line with our expectations, the declines in sales and volume were more than what we anticipated for the quarter as we experienced incremental customer share losses in both business segments due to an increasingly competitive environment.\nPrice/mix declined 2% as compared to the prior year quarter, which was just below our target for the period. Our pricing actions in North America were in line with our expectations. However, pricing in our international markets was more competitive. Channel and product mix was also in line with our expectations but unfavorable versus the prior year quarter, reflecting customer share losses exceeding customer gains.\nFor our North America segment specifically, sales declined 8% versus the prior year quarter. Volume declined 5% and included the carryover impact of smaller and regional customer share losses in food away-from-home channels in the prior year and share losses in certain chain restaurant accounts. The majority of the decline, however, was due to the drop in restaurant traffic in the U.S. According to restaurant industry data providers U.S. restaurant traffic in the second quarter declined about 2% versus the prior year.\nAlthough trends improved modestly versus our fiscal first quarter as QSR did continue to step up promotional activity. Traffic at QSR chain specializing in hamburgers in the second quarter declined about 1.5% versus the year ago period. We continue to be encouraged by the improving trend in traffic and the steady fry attachment rate. But as a reminder, many of these promotional meal deals have consumers trading down from a medium serving size to a small french fries serving size. As a result, while we benefit from improving traffic trends, the effect of the trade down in serving sizes acts as a partial and with some customers a significant headwind to our volumes.\nPrice/mix in North America declined 3%, reflecting the planned investments that we made to retain and attract volume as well as unfavorable channel and product mix.\nFor our International segment, sales declined 6% versus the prior year quarter. Volume declined 6%, driven by several factors. First, restaurant traffic declined or softened sequentially in many of our key international markets. While restaurant traffic in the U.K., our largest market in Europe, was flat, traffic declined in Germany, France and Spain. In Japan, QSR traffic grew versus the prior year but decelerated versus our fiscal first quarter. Traffic growth in China remained soft.\nSecond, we experienced incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment, most notably in the Middle East and certain markets in Asia Pacific.\nAnd third, we continue to realize the carryover effect of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in EMEA. This was the last quarter that will serve as a headwind. Price/mix was flat versus the prior year quarter as incremental pricing actions to compete in key international markets offset the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in EMEA.\nMoving on from sales. On Slide 6, you can see that adjusted EBITDA fell $95 million versus the prior year quarter to $282 million. The decrease is largely attributable to a $135 million decline in adjusted gross profit. That was due primarily to 4 factors.\nFirst, price/mix declined due to the planned pricing actions to retain customers and attract incremental volume.\nSecond, higher manufacturing cost per pound, which reflects input cost inflation and inefficiencies associated with lower production and low factory and potato utilization rates.\nThird, we incurred incremental production costs related to unplanned facility downtime and additional start-up costs associated with our new capacity expansions.\nAnd finally, while not impacting EBITDA, we incurred $16 million of higher depreciation expense that's largely related to our capacity expansions in China and Idaho that were completed last fiscal year.\nAdjusted SG&A declined $12 million to $165 million. We reduced adjusted SG&A despite an incremental $7 million of noncash amortization related to our new ERP system that went live in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Continued execution of our expense reduction initiatives, including those associated with our restructuring plan, drove most of the improvement with the remainder largely due to lower performance-based compensation and [indiscernible].\nFor North America specifically, adjusted EBITDA declined $55 million to $267 million, driven the combination of unfavorable price/mix, lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing cost per pound and incremental production costs.\nFor our International segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $53 million to $47 million. Buyer manufacturing cost per pound and incremental production costs drove the decline and the increasingly competitive environment in each region affected our ability to use price to fully offset inflation.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow on Slide 7. We ended the second quarter with about $80 million of cash and $1.2 billion available under our revolving credit facility. Our net debt was $4 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 3.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. In the first half of the year, we generated nearly $430 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus the prior year due to lower earnings, which were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the first half of the year, net of proceeds from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, were $486 million as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands during the second quarter and continued construction of our Argentina facility. We expect our capital spending during the second half of the year to significantly decline as we continue to target total annual capital expenditures of $750 million in fiscal 2025.\nDuring the quarter, we returned about $52 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. We did not purchase any shares under our share repurchase authorization during the second quarter.\nI'll now turn it back over to Tom, who will cover the next few slides. Tom?\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. At our Investor Day more than a year ago, we provided our view of the global frozen potato industry, including our estimates of future capacity additions as well as demand growth. Much has changed since then. So we wanted to provide you with our updated view.\nAs shown on Slide 8, prior to COVID, frozen potato demand in the U.S. and our key international markets was growing above historical rates resulting in Lamb Weston and the industry at large operating above full capacity. While COVID effected demand for a relatively short period, we saw evidence of frozen potato demand quickly rebounding to pre-COVID levels and historical growth rates. As a result, we strategically plan to expand capacity, so we would be well positioned to serve our customers and capture our share of growing global demand.\nSo starting in early 2021 and knowing that it typically takes 2 to 3 years to plan, construct and qualify a new facility, we were one of the first processors to announce major capacity expansions and modernization of our existing production lines. This included projects in China, Idaho, the Netherlands and Argentina.\nBy the time of our Investor Day in October 2023, as you can see on the chart, some competitors have also announced capacity expansion projects. Since then, legacy competitors as well as some relatively new market entrants have announced plans to construct more than 3.5 million pounds of additional capacity between 2024 and 2027. This primarily includes expansions in Europe, China and Brazil, but also in relatively new frozen potato processing regions such as India and the Middle East. While competitors' expansion announcements are always expected, we did not foresee the timing and aggregate scale of these additional expansions.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, including these additional announcements, we expect the industry in total may add up to 8.6 million pounds of incremental production capacity over the next 4 calendar years. Given the near-term operating environment, we don't know whether all capacity expansions that have been announced will move forward and be operational by the end of calendar 2028.\nThat said, if all these announced capacity additions are completed and on time and if there are no further capacity reductions, other than our strategic closure of Canal Washington facility, we estimate total industry capacity may be more than 44 billion pounds by the end of 2028. That's an additional 10 billion pounds of capacity being added between 2023 and 2028, which is 4 billion pounds more than what was added in the previous 5 years.\nThis has implications for industry capacity utilization. In 2024, we estimate capacity utilization is around 90% which itself is down from the high 90s during the past couple of years due to the slowdown in global demand and the addition of nearly 3 billion pounds of incremental supply by Lamb Weston and our peers. Over the next few years, we expect capacity utilization may be in the mid- to high 80s.\nAccordingly, and again, assuming all the announced expansion projects are completed or not significantly delayed, we expect the operating environment will remain challenged through the medium term, even if demand returns to historical rates as incremental capacity expansions add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America.\nAs you see on Slide 10, we have again been an early mover to implement actions to combat the challenging environment. Nearly 3 months ago, we announced a Restructuring Plan to address the imbalance and improve our cost structure. This included reducing head count, permanently closing a processing facility and temporarily curtailing production lines and schedules. We remain on track to deliver on the $55 million of cost savings associated with this plan in fiscal 2025 and annualized cost savings of $85 million in fiscal 2026.\nIn addition, as I noted earlier, we're continuing to evaluate and execute opportunities to adjust our supply chain operations and support functions to effectively manage through this challenging environment, protect our profitability and improve free cash flow.\nWe brought on a new Chief Supply Chain Officer about 4 months ago, and we're encouraged to see the opportunity she and the team identified to reduce our manufacturing and supply chain costs. In the back half of the year, we'll have more to say about these initiatives to improve performance and profitability.\nLet me now turn over the call to Bernadette to discuss our updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. While we anticipated a challenging environment for the balance of fiscal 2025 during our last earnings call, our performance so far has fallen short of expectations. As a result, we're reducing our financial targets for the year to reflect our performance in the second quarter as well as the increasingly competitive environment that Tom just described.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, we're reducing our net sales target range to $6.35 billion to $6.45 billion from our previous range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion. Using the midpoint of the new sales range implies a sales decline of 1% versus fiscal 2024. We're also reducing our adjusted EBITDA target range to $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion from our previous estimate of around $1.38 billion.\nLet me walk you through the key changes. On Slide 12, you can see that about 1/4 of the reduction in our annual sales target reflects the shortfall versus expectations during the second quarter. The remainder reflects the combination of factors that affect the second half of the year. In North America, we expect incremental sales volume pressure due to the impact of unexpected loss of a chain restaurant customer, partially offset by the benefit of some new customer wins and a greater than forecasted impact from the downsizing and serving size related to promotional meals at key customers.\nOur forecast for price/mix in North America is down modestly from our previous estimate due to less favorable mix than we previously anticipated. Our forecast specifically for price is essentially unchanged as the pricing environment, while competitive, remains largely in line with our initial expectations.\nIn our International segment, we expect volume to be below our previous forecast, primarily reflecting incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment as well as softer restaurant traffic in key international markets. In addition, we expect incremental pricing pressure in each of our regions, but for different reasons.\nIn Asia Pacific and Latin America, we're experiencing an increasingly competitive environment as demand growth slows and as additional supply from Europe and newer entrants in India, China and the Middle East gained share.\nIn EMEA, we're moderating some of the inflation-driven pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year to counter the initial surge in the market price of potatoes. In short, we expect the 1% decline in total Lamb Weston net sales versus the prior year will be driven by a low to mid-single-digit decline in price/mix, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in volume growth.\nWith respect to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13, you can see that nearly 1/3 of the $190 million reduction in our annual adjusted EBITDA target reflects the shortfall in our performance in the second quarter versus expectations. Most of the remaining reduction in our EBITDA forecast is due to the impact of a more competitive environment in our key international markets, which is affecting volume and our ability to pass along input cost inflation. It's also due to the reductions in volume and less favorable mix in North America that I described earlier. In addition, relative to our previous forecast, we expect to incur increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization.\nWith respect to SG&A, we're maintaining our current range of $680 million to $690 million, but will likely be towards the top end of the range. As you can see on Slide 14, based on our updated annual financial forecast for the second half of the year, we expect to deliver sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, implying growth of 1% to 4% as compared with the prior year period.\nWe expect higher volume in both international and North America will drive overall sales growth. We forecast that our International segment will contribute the majority of the overall volume increase, primarily reflecting the benefit of incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins across each of our geographic regions net of recent share losses, lapping the impact of canceled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition as well as the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal that affected our results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe expect North America volume growth to also reflect the benefit of lapping canceled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition, continued progress in regaining share of regional and small customers lost in the prior year and incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins, net of share losses.\nWe expect overall price/mix will be down in the second half of the year. In North America, we're forecasting price/mix will decline as pricing actions more than offset benefits of improved product and channel mix. As I previously noted, our price investments are consistent with our prior expectations. In International, we're forecasting overall price/mix will also decline due to pricing actions in response to competitive dynamics in key international markets.\nMoving to earnings. In the second half, we expect to deliver $600 million to $640 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is in line with what we delivered in the prior period. Overall, we expect to benefit from incremental volume growth in both International and North America will drive EBITDA growth but will be largely offset by planned investments in price in North America incremental price actions in key international markets and the impact of input cost inflation and increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization, which we are actively working to address.\nNow turning to our thoughts on capital expenditures on Slide 15. As I previously noted, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $750 million for fiscal 2025. We spent about $485 million during first half of the year, as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands and continued construction of our Argentina facility. Spending in the second half of the year will focus on maintenance, modernization and the continued construction of our Argentina facility, which is on track to be completed in mid calendar 2025.\nFor 2026, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $550 million. We expect about $400 million will be for base maintenance capital and modernization efforts, which is in line with our annual depreciation and amortization expense. The other $150 million will be for environmental capital projects that largely focus on wastewater treatment at our manufacturing facilities. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect to spend about $500 million in total over the next 5 years to comply with increasingly strict government regulations and permit limitations.\nFor at least a few years beyond 2026, given our expectations for lower industry capacity utilization, we do not expect to direct any significant investments to growth capital. We'll focus our spending on base and modernization capital, which together is generally up to 5% of sales, plus an additional $75 million or so each year for environmental projects. As a result, fiscal 2026 should be a positive inflection point for our free cash flow. Note that the annual amounts that I just described exclude any capital we expect to deploy when we restart the next phase of our ERP implementation.\nTurning to our thoughts on capital return to shareholders on Slide 16. Today, we announced a $250 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. With this increase, we have approximately $560 million remaining under our authorization. As has been our practice, we'll continue to use a disciplined approach to repurchasing shares. But the increased authorization, combined with the increase in expected free cash flows, provides us with the flexibility to opportunistically buy back shares under the program.\nWith respect to dividends, we declared a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share. This is consistent with our history of increasing our dividend each year since becoming a public company more than 8 years ago. Our target dividend payout ratio remains 25% to 35% of earnings per share. While we're above that range today, that's a result of temporarily depressed earnings.\nLet me now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. So let me just summarize today by saying, we expect the operating environment in the near term will remain challenging as additional capacity expansions are announced during a period of ongoing pressure on demand. We are proactively adapting to this dynamic environment by strategically adjusting our footprint, reducing capital expenditures, managing our cost structure and improving cash flow. At the same time, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and steady increases in our dividend while continuing to maintain and modernize our production assets.\nOverall, we remain well positioned with the unique strength and scale that Lamb Weston system provides navigated tough industry-wide operating environment. We're taking actions to adapt our operations to weather these transitory challenges and make lasting improvements to our operations, and we'll continue to leverage our solid fundamentals and balance sheet to continue to deliver value to our shareholders.\nBefore taking questions, I just want to end with saying again that serving as Lamb Weston's President and CEO, has been a privilege and an honor, and I'm proud of what the entire Lamb Weston team has accomplished during the last 8 years. With Mike and his leadership team at the helm, Lamb Weston's future is in great hands. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nNow let me turn it back over to Dexter.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Before opening up the call for questions, I just want to note that Mike and Bernadette will be on the road with investors in January. We'll provide details for those meetings shortly after the start of the new year.\nWith that, we're now ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our strategies and priorities for the upcoming year, the current operating environment, and our initial thoughts on this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal '25. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year are disappointing, reflecting executional challenges both commercially and in our supply chain as well as soft global demand for fries. While Bernadette will cover our fourth quarter results in more detail later, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets due to a combination of targeted investments in price, a decision to voluntarily withdraw our product to ensure we meet our quality standards and, more importantly, those of our customers, higher-than-anticipated market share losses, an unfavorable mix, and softer-than-expected restaurant traffic trends in both the U.S. and many of our key international markets.\nThis level of execution is unacceptable, and I and my leadership team take full responsibility for our operating and financial results. As we outlined in our Investor Day last October, we believe that frozen potatoes is an attractive growing global category and that we have built a solid foundation to serve our customers in this market over the long term. This includes some key actions taken in fiscal 2024 such as: integrating the acquisition of our former European joint venture; starting up state-of-the-art processing facilities in China in October 2023 and American Falls, Idaho in May of 2024; strengthening our product portfolio by introducing innovative technologies to expand our total addressable market; implementing pricing actions that offset multiple years of high input cost inflation; taking a big step in upgrading our IT infrastructure by cutting over key central systems processes in North America to a new ERP system; and continuing to drive supply chain productivity savings across our global production network.\nWe believe we're focused on the right strategies and priorities to get Lamb Weston back on track to drive sales growth, reduce costs, improve profitability, and generate attractive returns over the long term. That said, the operating environment has changed rapidly during fiscal 2024 as global restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand softened. In fact, the downward traffic trends accelerated during the back half of the year and into early fiscal 2025. This has led to an increase in available industry capacity in North America and Europe. We believe this industry supply-demand imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025.\nAlthough this has no impact on our long-term strategies, we are making some operating adjustments in the near term to support improved execution, competitiveness in our financial results. We are reinvigorating volume growth by matching the right product at the right price to fit customer needs and by also leveraging limited-time offerings and innovation to help our customers drive traffic. We're targeting specific investments in price and trade support to protect share and win new business. We're aggressively looking at opportunities to reduce costs further by driving supply chain productivity and tightly managing operating expenses.\nWe're leveraging recent capacity investments to increase flexibility in managing our manufacturing footprint to balance production and shipments. We're reshaping future investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. And we're simplifying our key processes to make it easier for customers to do business with Lamb Weston. These priorities will change how we expect to drive sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2025.\nSpecifically, our sales growth will be largely volume-driven unlike the price-driven top line that we've delivered in recent years. Overall, we expect the net impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions in the aggregate will have minimal contribution to our net sales as we employ targeted investments in price to support volume growth. As a result, we expect our earnings performance will be driven by a combination of volume growth, improved mix, and cost savings. In recent years, our earnings growth has been largely driven by price and, to a lesser extent, mix.\nOur expectation for volume growth is dependent in part on an improvement in restaurant traffic trends. According to restaurant industry data providers, U.S. restaurant traffic softened over the past year as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of menu price inflation. During our fiscal fourth quarter, overall U.S. restaurant traffic as well as QSR traffic was down about 3% versus the prior year. Traffic at QSR chains specializing in hamburgers, a highly important channel for fry consumption, was down more than 4%. In addition, traffic trends in QSR hamburger weakened sequentially each month of the quarter, with May down nearly 6%.\nHowever, we're encouraged that the QSR chains, including QSR hamburger chains, have increased promotional activities to drive restaurant traffic. Given the recent introduction, we believe these promotions did not affect traffic during our fiscal fourth quarter, and we have not yet received comprehensive data that would indicate a more recent benefit on traffic. But we expect that these promotional efforts will have a positive effect on traffic as they have done so in the past.\nOutside the U.S., overall restaurant traffic trends in our key international markets in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with what we observed in the third quarter. Overall traffic was up in France and Italy, down modestly in Germany and Spain, and down about 2% in the U.K., our largest market in Europe. In Asia, overall restaurant traffic grew in both China and Japan. While global restaurant traffic trends were mixed, fry attachment rates in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China were largely steady.\nWith our key international markets largely stable and the potential for a tailwind from promotional activity in the U.S., we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary and remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rate as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Nonetheless, we've taken a cautious view of the consumer and have not incorporated any change to current trends in our fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result, we expect our volume to decline during the first half of fiscal 2025.\nTurning now to the upcoming potato crop. We're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties in North America, and initial indications are that this portion of the crop is consistent with historical averages. At this time, the potato crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the Midwest that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable. That said, we have not yet seen what impact, if any, the recent heat wave may have on the crop. As a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a 3% decrease in aggregate in contract prices for the 2024 potato crop. And we would begin to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning in our fiscal third quarter.\nIn Europe, heavy rainfall in the spring in the industry's main growing region in the Netherlands, Belgium, northern France, and northern Germany delayed the completion of planning by about 7 weeks. As a result, the futures index for European processing potatoes has climbed significantly, reflecting the market's expectation for a below-average crop. Based on our practice of purchasing a higher portion of our raw potatoes using fixed price contracts, we believe our exposure to the higher market price is less than that of our European competitors.\nStill, we expect our potato costs in Europe to increase as prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid- to high single digits. We'll provide more detail on the crops in both North America and Europe when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nSo in summary, we believe we've built a solid foundation to support our customers and drive improvement in our financial performance. We continue to operate and invest in this business for the long term and are making the appropriate adjustments this year to manage through the current challenging environment. We're encouraged by the actions that chain restaurants are taking to improve restaurant traffic as well as the traffic trends in most of our key international markets, but we took a cautious view on the consumer when we developed this year's financial targets.\nAnd finally, at this time, we expect the potato crop in North America will be consistent with historical averages, but that the crop in Europe will likely be below average. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2025 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets. Our team members are focused on getting our operations and financial results back on track in fiscal 2025. Before I provide our outlook for the upcoming year, let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results.\nSales declined $83 million or 5% to more than $1.61 billion. Volume declined 8% and price/mix increased 3%. As it relates to volume, nearly 5 percentage points of the decline reflects the impact of share losses, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. The decline is a couple of points more than what we originally anticipated and was driven in part by higher-than-estimated share losses.\nWith respect to the ERP transition, the issues we experienced that affected our third quarter order fill rates were temporary and contained in that quarter. We have healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system. The remaining 3 points of the 8-point volume decline reflected about 1 point loss related to the unexpected voluntary product withdrawal that Tom referenced, and about 2 points related to soft restaurant traffic trends in North America and many of our key international markets, which was a bit more than we had expected.\nPrice/mix increased 3%, reflecting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late fiscal 2023 as well as pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 across both of our business segments. The increase in price/mix, however, was a few points below our expectations. This was largely due to unfavorable mix versus our forecast as customer demand for value-based products increased as well as targeted investments in price in North America.\nMoving on from sales, our adjusted gross profit declined $72 million to $363 million. About $40 million of that decline was due to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining $32 million was primarily driven by lower volume and an $8 million increase in depreciation expense associated with our capacity expansions in China and Idaho. The carryover benefit of our pricing actions largely offset higher manufacturing costs, which was primarily driven by mid-single-digit input cost inflation.\nOur gross margin in the quarter was about 23%, which was about 400 basis points below our target of 27%. Of the shortfall, about 250 basis points was related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining roughly 150 basis points largely reflected the unfavorable mix impact from greater-than-expected share losses of higher-priced, higher-margin customers as well as the investments in price that we made in our North America segment. Adjusted SG&A declined $6 million to $172 million, reflecting lower performance-based compensation expense, which more than offset higher expenses associated with information technology investments, higher advertising and promotion investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA, and $6 million of incremental noncash amortization related to our new ERP system.\nOur SG&A in the quarter was about $20 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter target of approximately $193 million, largely due to lower performance-based compensation expense and other cost savings efforts. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $283 million, which is down $50 million versus the prior year as lower sales and gross profit more than offset the decline in SG&A. That's about $80 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter EBITDA target of approximately $363 million. About half of that shortfall is due to the voluntary product withdrawal late in the quarter. The other half is due largely to targeted investments in price and trade support in our North America segment, unfavorable mix, and lower-than-expected volume, partially offset by favorable SG&A compared with our forecast.\nMoving to our segments. Compared with the year ago period, sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined $47 million or 4% in the quarter. Volume declined 7% with about 5 points related to share losses and about 2% related to soft restaurant traffic in the U.S. Price/mix increased 3%, driven by the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late 2023, as well as pricing actions for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers taken in fiscal 2024.\nUnfavorable mix due to share losses of higher-margin customers as well as targeted investments in price tempered the increase in price/mix. The North America segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million or 7% to $277 million primarily due to an approximately $19 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder largely reflects a combination of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, and higher cost per pound, more than offsetting the benefit of prior pricing actions.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, declined $36 million or 7%. Volume declined 9% with nearly 5 percentage points from share losses, which are due in part to decisions to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. We expect these strategic exits will continue to be a headwind through the first half of fiscal 2025. More than 2 points of the volume decline in the quarter reflects the voluntary product withdrawal, while the remaining roughly 2 points reflected soft restaurant traffic trends in key international markets.\nPrice/mix increased 2%, driven primarily by inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken earlier in fiscal 2024. Our International segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $43 million or 52% to $40 million. About $21 million of that decline related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder of that decline was driven by lower sales volume, higher cost per pound, and higher advertising and promotional investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA and was partially offset by the benefit of prior pricing actions.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with net debt leverage ratio of 2.7x adjusted EBITDA, and our net debt declined nearly $40 million as compared to the end of our fiscal third quarter to about $3.75 billion. We continue to have ample liquidity, including nearly $1.2 billion available for a new global revolving credit facility. For the year, we generated about $800 million of cash from operations, which is up about $37 million versus the prior year. As we discussed before, driving long-term growth requires making the right, strategic, and forward-looking investments. The resilience of our business and our overall financial strength put us in the ideal position to modernize our assets as well as to invest in critical areas that support customer needs and unlock efficiencies for our people and our business.\nThis allowed us to spend about $990 million in capital expenditures this year or about $255 million more than the prior year, largely reflecting strategic investments, to complete facilities in China and American Falls, Idaho, our ongoing capacity expansion projects in the Netherlands and Argentina, and our new ERP system. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we returned $384 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year. This includes $210 million in share repurchases, including $60 million in the fourth quarter and $174 million in dividends. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our confidence in our business.\nNow turning to our fiscal 2025 outlook. As Tom discussed, we expect that the operating environment this year will be challenging, and that consumers will continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend in a pressured economic landscape. We expect that soft restaurant traffic and fry demand may result in higher-than-normal available industry capacity for selected product types and channels in fiscal 2025, and that we will make some targeted investments in price and trade to support volume growth and share. In addition, we're aggressively evaluating opportunities and implementing actions to drive supply chain productivity, balanced production based on lower shipments, and reduced operating expenses.\nSpecifically for the year, we're targeting sales of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion on a constant currency basis. This implies growth of 2% to 5%, which we expect will be driven largely by volume. However, we anticipate that volume will decline during the first half of the year, primarily due to 2 factors: first, we'll continue to experience the impact of recent share losses; and second, despite efforts by quick service and casual dining chains to improve traffic through increased promotional activity, we expect that restaurant traffic will remain soft for at least the first half of the year as the consumer continues to adjust to the cumulative impact of years of menu price inflation as well as other economic headwinds.\nDuring the second half of the year, we expect our volume to increase as we lap the prior year impacts of the ERP transition and voluntary product withdrawal, increasingly benefit from recent customer contract wins in the U.S. and key international markets, and recapture some of the market share we lost in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, we don't expect a meaningful contribution to come from price/mix in the aggregate. In North America, we're targeting price/mix to decline. We expect to drive improvements in mix as the year progresses as we recapture lost share in higher-priced, higher-margin channels. However, due to the soft demand environment, we believe the mix benefits will be more than offset by targeted investments in price and trade support to drive volume growth and share growth across the sales channels.\nIn International, when possible under the terms of the customer contracts, we'll look to drive pricing actions to offset input cost inflation, which we anticipate will be largely driven by a below-average crop in Europe. In addition, we'll begin to gradually leverage our revenue growth management tools to manage our price architectures and improve mix. However, we anticipate that the increase in price/mix may be tempered by targeted investments in price and trade support in certain markets and channels to protect market share and win new business.\nFor earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.38 billion to $1.48 billion. For diluted earnings per share, we're targeting $4.35 to $4.85. This includes an adjusted SG&A target of $740 million to $750 million, which is up $70 million versus the prior year, reflecting returning performance-based compensation expense back to targeted levels, an incremental $24 million of noncash amortization related to our new ERP system, and an incremental $10 million of advertising and promotional investments largely to support our retail brands in both North America and EMEA. Excluding these 3 items, our adjusted SG&A expenses are down due to aggressive cost management. As I previously discussed, we're continuing to evaluate and implement additional cost savings actions.\nWe're targeting total depreciation and amortization expense of $375 million, which is an increase of $75 million. About $50 million of the increase is included in cost of sales and largely associated with the depreciation of the capacity expansions in China, Idaho, and the Netherlands. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the incremental amortization of our ERP system, which is recorded in SG&A.\nFor interest expense, we're forecasting about $180 million. That's an increase of about $45 million, reflecting higher average debt levels and lower capitalized interest. We're forecasting a full year effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is similar to last year's rate. Finally, we're targeting cash use for capital expenditures of approximately $850 million as we continue the construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts in the Netherlands and Argentina. We currently expect the expansion in the Netherlands to be completed by the end of calendar 2024, while Argentina is targeted to be operational in mid-calendar 2025.\nIn addition, as Tom mentioned, we're looking at rephasing future capital investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. That said, more than 80% of this year's forecasted capital expenditures are committed. Since we anticipate our 2 large capacity expansions will be completed by the end of fiscal 2025, we expect a notable decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2026.\nBecause of the rapid change in the operating environment, our fiscal 2025 growth rates are below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline. As it relates to sales, our fiscal 2025 outlook implies a normalized growth rate of 0% to 3% after adjusting for the estimated impact of the ERP transition in fiscal 2024. That growth rate is at the low end of our long-term growth algorithm of low to mid-single digits. Our adjusted EBITDA target for fiscal 2025 is about $160 million, below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline of about $1.6 billion.\nBroadly speaking, that decline reflects targeted investments in price and trade support to retain or win new customers, challenges in certain markets and channels to implement sufficient pricing to offset input cost inflation, an estimated carryover impact of unfavorable mix from lost share of higher-priced, higher-margin customers in North America, and an additional estimated $20 million to $30 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 associated with the voluntary product withdrawal.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide some thoughts on the first quarter. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given our recent results, the expected headwinds and the changes in the operating environment, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the quarter. Specifically in the first quarter, we're targeting sales to be down mid- to high single digits, with volume down mid-single digits due to the carryover impact of share losses, soft restaurant traffic, and the voluntary product withdrawal. We believe that the impact of share losses and soft traffic will be the greatest in the first quarter and gradually ease as the year progresses.\nWe expect price/mix may be down low to mid-single digits as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 are more than offset by the impact of unfavorable mix and targeted investments in price and trade support in North America. For earnings, we expect our EBITDA margin to be the lowest of the year due to our typical seasonality and the $20 million to $30 million loss estimated to be associated with the voluntary product withdrawal that I mentioned earlier. We do not expect additional losses related to the product withdrawal beyond the first quarter. We also expect our first quarter margin will be pressured by higher cost per pound, unfavorable mix, and investments in price and trade support. Let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. We expect fiscal 2025 to be a challenging year but remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. Despite the current market softness, we're executing on our priorities that drive our long-term strategy. We're aggressively managing costs and evaluating our manufacturing network requirements as demand trends unfold. Our capacity expansion projects remain on schedule as we continue to modernize our production assets, which when combined with improving our core asset performance, positions us to continue to support our customers and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining our call today and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. .\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures.

You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the ERP transition, the current demand environment and the status of this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our third quarter results as well as our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. This was a challenging quarter as we transition certain central systems and functions in North America from a decades-old legacy enterprise resource planning system to SAP. The transition is the first step towards a multiyear global rollout. Among other areas, the scope of this transition affected receiving and processing customer orders, trade pricing and promotion management, managing inventories and warehousing, scheduling, transportation and shipments, invoicing customers and treasury and cash management.\nWhile the transition went well in many areas, it proved more difficult than we expected despite the countless hours we spent planning, testing and preparing for the transition. Specifically, we experienced significant challenges with inventory visibility at distribution centers, which led to shipment delays, canceled orders and ultimately, lower-than-expected volumes in the quarter. In particular, we had more difficulty filling shipments of mixed product loads, which are generally higher margin than shipments of single product loads. This pressured margins in the quarter. we partnered closely with our third-party and company-owned distribution centers to minimize the impact of these challenges. This included co-locating Lamb Weston team members at our distribution centers to resolve data errors and processing issues in real time and adjusting systems and processes for balancing inventory between distribution centers and SAP.\nWe also work closely with our customers to limit the impact on their operations, and I want to thank them for their patience and commitment as we manage through the transition. Importantly, I also want to thank our Lamb Weston team members who worked around the clock to help restore customer shipments and service back to pre-transition levels. As Bernadette will cover in more detail later, we estimate that the ERP transition reduced net sales by about $135 million and volume growth by approximately 8 percentage points in the third quarter. We also estimate that adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $95 million, with more than half of that due to lower sales and unfulfilled customer orders and the remainder due to incremental costs and expenses directly related to the transition.\nAs with any transition, our teams are still adapting to the new system. I'm pleased that we have contained the effect of the inventory visibility issues to our fiscal third quarter and restored customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. We understand that some customers effected by either delayed or canceled shipments may have temporarily secured supply from alternative sources until they gain confidence in our service levels.\nWith healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system, we're actively engaging customers with our direct sales force to earn their trust and their business. Turning now to the demand environment. Overall, global french fry demand remains resilient, but we believe it's currently at or below the historical annual growth rate of about 2% to 4%. According to restaurant industry data providers, restaurant traffic trends in the U.S. have been generally flat to slightly down during the past 6 to 9 months as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of inflation on menus.\nQSR traffic during the third quarter was flat versus the prior year after growing modestly during the first half of fiscal 2024. Several QSRs have attributed this to less visits by lower-income consumers as their disposable income has been more affected by the overall inflationary environment. Meanwhile, traffic at full-service restaurants has declined each quarter during fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic continued to increase versus the prior year in most of our key markets.\nBut growth has also slowed sequentially from our fiscal second quarter. Similar to the U.S., we believe traffic in these markets is also affected by consumers adjusting to the cumulative effect of inflation as well as other macro headwinds. Restaurant traffic growth in our larger markets in Europe in the third quarter was mixed. Traffic was up in France, Germany and Italy but at notably slower rates than during the first half of fiscal 2024.\nTraffic was down in the U.K. and Spain. In Asia, traffic growth in both China and Japan was solid, while in the Middle East, traffic was down. While global restaurant traffic has slowed, the fry attachment rates in North America and in our key international markets have been generally stable. So on the one hand, fries remain as popular as ever with consumers. But on the other hand, consumers are going out to eat less often.\nBecause of these recent trends, we're taking a more cautious view of the consumer. In our previous financial outlook, we expect the restaurant traffic and demand would pick up in the fourth quarter. As Bernadette will cover in more detail, we're now taking a more prudent approach to our expected sales and volume performance in the near term. We currently anticipate volume will decline mid-single digits as opposed to our previous expectation of modest volume growth in the fourth quarter.\nDespite this near-term caution, we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary, and we remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rates as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Turning now to the upcoming potato crop. In North America, we've agreed to a 3% decline in the aggregate and contract prices for the 2024 potato crop and have largely secured the targeted number of acres to be planted across our primary growing regions.\nPlanting is on schedule for the early potato varieties, and we expect planning for the main harvest to be completed by the end of April. Although we expect our potato costs in North America to decline somewhat during the second half of fiscal 2025, assuming an average crop, they will likely be offset by a rise in our other input costs. In Europe, prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid- to high single digits, and we've contracted for our targeted amount of acres.\nWe'll provide our typical update on the outlook for potato crops in North America and Europe when we issue our fourth quarter earnings in late July. So in summary, we believe the impact of the order fulfillment issues has been contained in the third quarter as service levels have been restored to pre-transition levels. Overall, global fry demand remains resilient, although restaurant traffic trends continue to be challenged as consumers adjust to higher menu prices.\nWe have reduced our fiscal 2024 financial targets to reflect these softer traffic trends and the higher-than-expected financial impact of the ERP transition. And finally, we have largely locked in the pricing and acreage needed for this year's crop in North America and Europe. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion on our third quarter results and updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we're not happy with the magnitude of the impact to the ERP transition on our customers, our business and our P&L. However, I do want to take a moment and say how proud I am of our Lamb Weston team members who did work tirelessly to remedy the issues we experienced and bring our customer order fulfillment rates back to pre-transition levels within the quarter. .\nI also want to thank our sales team members who stayed close to our customers to limit the impact as much as possible on their businesses. Let's review our third quarter results. Sales increased $205 million or 16% to $1.46 billion. The entire increase was driven by $357 million of incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business. This is the last quarter that we'll receive the incremental benefit from the EMEA consolidation since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIf we exclude the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $152 million or 12%. We estimate that the majority of the decline or approximately $135 million was due to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 4% as we continued to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and international segments.\nHowever, unfavorable mix related to the type of orders we were able to fill during the ERP transition partially offset the benefit of the pricing actions. In addition, lower freight charges to customers were nearly a 5-point headwind, which was driven by lower volume shipped and the pass-through of lower freight rates when shipping products to customers. Total sales volumes declined 16%, with about 8 points of the decline associated with unfilled customer orders due to the ERP system transition.\nThe other 8 points of the decline was primarily driven by 2 factors: first, more than half reflected softer-than-expected restaurant traffic trends in North America and key international markets. As Tom mentioned, we believe the traffic trends remain challenging as consumers continue to adapt to higher menu prices. In addition, unusually poor weather in January negatively affected traffic in the U.S.\nSecond, the remainder of the volume decline reflected the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is the last quarter in which we will see any meaningful headwind from the 4 notable contracts that we exited last year to strategically manage customer and product mix. Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit increased $24 million to $427 million, which was driven by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions and incremental earnings from the consolidation of the EMEA business.\nThe increase was partially offset by mid-single-digit input cost inflation on a per pound basis and a $20 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes as we considered the softer restaurant traffic trends in North America as well as the higher-than-expected impact on volume from the ERP transition. In addition, we estimate that the ERP transition negatively impacted adjusted gross profit by approximately $88 million. We estimate that approximately $55 million was due to lower volumes and negative mix.\nand that the remaining $33 million was due to about $26 million from reduced fixed cost coverage and inefficiencies arising from planned downtime for the ERP transition in our factories as well as additional freight charges as we sought to reduce the impact of shipment delays on our customers and about $7 million for penalties associated with delayed shipments or the inability to fill customer orders. Adjusted SG&A increased $30 million to $164 million, primarily due to incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA as well as higher expenses associated with the ERP system transition, including noncash amortization.\nThe increase includes approximately $7 million of incremental costs to support the system post go-live, including efforts to restore customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. A reduction in compensation and benefit accruals tempered the increase in SG&A. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $344 million, which is down 2% versus the prior year. Lower income in the Lamb Weston base business, which includes an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition and a $25 million write-off of excess potatoes more than offset incremental earnings from consolidating the EMEA business and the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions.\nSo on an underlying basis, excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been around $465 million, while sales excluding acquisitions and the impact of the ERP transition would have been down 1% to 2%. Moving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico declined $123 million or 12% in the quarter. We estimate that essentially all of that decline was due to unfilled orders and unfavorable mix attributable to the ERP transition.\nPrice/mix was up 5% driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year. Mix was unfavorable as higher margin; lower volume customers, which typically have more complex mixed product orders were harder to fill until the inventory visibility issues related to the ERP transition were resolved.\nIn addition, lower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price/mix by more than 4 percentage points. Volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline, reflecting unfilled customer orders resulting from the ERP transition. The remainder of the decline primarily reflects soft restaurant traffic and retail trends as well as the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA declined 14% to $286 million. The decline was largely driven by an estimated $83 million impact from the ERP transition and $23 million charge for the write-off of excess potatoes, of which about $5 million of the excess potato write-off was incurred at our North American joint venture. The impact of lower volumes and higher cost per pound also contributed to the decline. These factors more than offset the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, grew nearly $330 million, of which $357 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $29 million or 16%. We estimate approximately $12 million of that decline relates to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 1%, driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year as well as pricing actions taken this year.\nLower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price mix by about 5 percentage points. Sales volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. The remainder of the volume decline reflects unfilled customer orders served by North American exports as a result of the ERP transition.\nInternational segment's adjusted EBITDA increased 88% to $102 billion. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results drove the increase. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound, an estimated $5 million impact from the ERP transition, lower volumes and a $2 million allocated charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes more than offset favorable price mix.\nLet's move to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 2.6x adjusted EBITDA, up from 2.4x at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our net debt increased about $270 million to $3.8 billion as we drew on our revolver to largely finance increased working capital needs during the ERP system transition as well as increased capital expenditures.\nWe continue to have ample liquidity, including more than $900 million available under our revolving credit facilities. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated more than $480 million of cash from operations, up about $145 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher earnings. We spent nearly $830 million in capital expenditures, which is up about $330 million from the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects construction and equipment costs for our new China factory that started up in November as well as costs related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho, Netherlands and Argentina.\nAnd finally, we've returned more than $270 million of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $122 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. Turning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. We updated our full year sales and earnings targets to reflect the impact of the ERP system transition as well as near-term demand trends. Specifically, we reduced our annual net sales target to $6.54 billion to $6.6 billion from our previous target range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. The updated range includes $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first 3 quarters of the year.\nOur updated sales target implies sales of $1.69 billion to $1.75 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is flat to up 3% compared with the same period a year ago. We expect price/mix will drive our sales growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and actions we've taken in fiscal 2024. We expect lower freight charges to customers will continue to partially offset the increase in price/mix.\nAs Tom noted, we expect volumes in the fourth quarter will decline mid-single digits, which is down from our previous target of positive volume growth. The primary reasons for the change include our expectation that soft restaurant traffic trends in North America will continue longer than we initially anticipated. And that restaurant traffic trends in several of our key international markets have also softened more than expected. We point to softer restaurant traffic trends as the driver affecting our volume performance since our fry attachment rates in North America and our key international markets have generally been stable and that our customer order fulfillment rates that were affected as part of the ERP transition in North America are back to pre-transition levels.\nIn addition, we expect volume in the fourth quarter may be impacted by some customers in North America that were affected by the ERP transition seeking supply at least temporarily from alternative sources. For earnings, we reduced our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion from a previous range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. That's down about $85 million using the midpoints of the 2 ranges. The decrease largely reflects an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition, a $25 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes and the impact of softer restaurant traffic trends in North America and our key international markets.\nWe partially offset the decrease by absorbing some of the financial impact of the ERP transition as well as reducing compensation and benefit accruals. Our updated target implies adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $375 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% versus the prior year quarter using the midpoint of the range. We expect higher sales and adjusted gross profit to drive the growth, partially offset by adjusted SG&A of $190 million to $195 million.\nWith respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share, we lowered our full year target to $5.50 to $5.65. We're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We expect capital expenditures of $950 million, which is the upper end of our previous range of $900 million to $950 million. We also expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 23%, which is at the low end of our targeted range of 23% to 24%. Our targets for depreciation and amortization expense of $300 million and interest expense of $140 million are unchanged.\nLet me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. With the impact of the order fulfillment issues behind us, we remain focused on serving our customers as we close out fiscal 2024. While near-term demand trends may be soft, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. And by continuing to execute our strategies, we believe that we will remain well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today.\nActual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the potato crop and the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our call today. The entire Lamb Weston team delivered another solid quarter, and I want to thank them for these results and continuing to execute the strategies that we outlined in our Investor Day presentation in October.\nWe strongly believe that our investments to expand capacity organically and through acquisitions, improved manufacturing and system capabilities, penetrate new channels and markets around the world, strengthen product, customer and channel mix, and develop our people have generated good near-term operating momentum and have us well positioned to capture our share of growth and profitability over the long term.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered record sales, reflecting the consolidation of our EMEA business and solid price/mix growth. Sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, declined primarily driven by our decision to exit lower priced and lower margin business. But as we expect the year-over-year trend improved sequentially, adjusted EBITDA growth was also solid behind incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA as well as higher sales and gross profit in the base business. However, the increase was tempered by a $71 million charge to write-off excess for raw potatoes, $65 million of which was recorded in cost of sales and $6 million in equity method investment earnings.\nThe reason and magnitude of this charge is very unusual. So let me give you a little more color on it. In January 2023, we developed an initial sales forecast for the following fiscal year that reflected a gradually strengthening consumer and recovery in global demand. That forecast was developed based on the information available at that time. We used this initial sales forecast to determine the number of contracted acres to grow the raw potatoes needed to deliver that sales forecast.\nPer our agreements with our growers, we're obligated to purchase all the potatoes grown on these contracted acres. However, our initial sales forecast has turned out to be more aggressive than our current estimate, reflecting recent restaurant traffic and demand trends as consumers continue to absorb the cumulative effect of inflation. As a result, we have purchased more potatoes than we need to meet our current sales targets and have taken a charge to write off the estimated excess. Although overall demand growth is slower than we anticipated a year ago, it remains resilient. Fri attachment rates in the U.S. are stable and in line with what we projected in January 2023.\nOutside the U.S., restaurant traffic in most of our key international markets continues to grow, including double-digit growth in China. We remain confident that our volume trends will continue to improve in the back half of fiscal 2024 as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher-margin business. This includes our target for year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we expect our volumes will continue to recover in fiscal 2025 and have planned to contract for acres accordingly. While we are disappointed with the write-offs, the underlying fundamentals of the business, our operations in the category remain solid. Our volume trends are improving in line with our expectations. Global demand is resilient as consumers continue to face stiff food away from home inflation.\nOur new greenfield processing facility in China is now operational. Price/mix trends in the U.S. and most of our key international markets remain solid, while input cost inflation is decelerating. We delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth and gross margin expansion, excluding the potato write-off. And as Bernadette will explain in greater detail, we're reaffirming our fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range despite absorbing the write-off while raising our EPS estimates.\nOverall, we continue to be pleased with our operating momentum and confident in our ability to deliver our full year financial targets. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette dead for a more detailed discussion on our second quarter results and updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and happy New Year, everyone. I also want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for the continued execution of our strategies and for delivering another quarter of strong financial results. For our second quarter, sales increased about $455 million or 36% to more than $1.7 billion. About $375 million or more than 80% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business.\nWe'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA business in the third quarter. And as a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales grew 6%. Price/mix was up 12% as we continue to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 along with the pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and international segments.\nMix was also favorable as we continued to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. Lower freight charges to customers were about a 1 point headwind. Total sales volumes declined 6%, which was in line with our expectations. The decline was primarily due to the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nVolume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions remain low. While sales volumes declined compared to the prior year period, it is a sequential improvement from the 8% decline that we delivered in our fiscal first quarter. The improving trend largely reflects no further impact of the inventory destocking in Asia and North America that we experienced in the first quarter and the gradual backfilling of the business that we chose to exit.\nMoving on from sales. Gross profit, excluding unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivatives and items impacting comparability, increased $97 million to nearly $480 million. Our gross profit growth was tempered by a $65 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. Excluding this charge as well as the mark-to-market and comparability items, gross profit increased to $162 million to more than $540 million. About half of this increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nThe other half of the increase was from incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Input costs increased mid-single digits on a per pound basis, which is a bit lower than the mid- to high single digits that we saw in the first quarter. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America, and continued increases in the cost of ingredients for batter coatings, labor and other key inputs.\nThe inflation was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower cost for edible oils and lower freight costs. SG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $42 million to $177 million. More than 2/3 of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, with the remainder largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure as well as compensation and benefit expenses.\nAll of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 15% to $377 million. Excluding the write-off for excess raw potatoes, adjusted EBITDA increased 36% to $448 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth with the remainder attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico increased 10% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 14%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year, and favorable mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management and other mix improvement initiatives.\nLower freight revenue partially offset the increase by about 1.5 points.\nVolume in North America declined 4%, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is a sequential improvement from the 5% decline in our fiscal first quarter.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $321 million. The carryover benefit of pricing actions and favorable mix more than offset a $63 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, higher cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America grew about $350 million, of which $376 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined 12%. Price/mix was up 10% driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year, discrete pricing actions taken this year and favorable mix.\nSales volumes fell 22% primarily reflecting the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. International segment adjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $100 million with incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results driving the increase.\nExcluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound, along with the impact of lower volumes more than offset the favorable price/mix. The higher cost per pound included an $8 million charge allocated to the International segment for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, which was based on the percentage of finished goods shipments to international markets.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with our net debt leverage at 2.4x, adjusted EBITDA up from 2.3x at the end of our fiscal first quarter. Our net debt ticked up a couple of hundred million dollars to more than $3.5 billion as we drew on our U.S. revolver to largely finance seasonal working capital needs and increased capital expenditures.\nWe also accelerated some payments to suppliers in advance of our ERP system go live at the beginning of the third quarter. In the first half of the year, we generated $455 million of cash from operations or nearly $170 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures in the first half were about $565 million, which is up about $300 million from the prior year period, primarily due to construction and equipment purchases as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands. As Tom mentioned, we started up our new facility in China a couple of months ago.\nAs we discussed during our Investor Day in October, our first priority is investing in our business, which we are doing organically with our capacity expansions. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. During the first half of the year, we returned more than $230 of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $82 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases.\nThis includes $50 million of stock repurchased in the second quarter at an average price of $87.41 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price. In addition, in October, we raised our share repurchase authorization to $500 million. And in December, we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share.\nTurning now to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We reaffirmed our full year sales and EBITDA targets and raised our EPS estimate despite the charge to write-off excess raw potatoes. Specifically, we reaffirmed our annual net sales target of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first 3 quarters of the year and 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth, excluding our acquisitions.\nFor the year, we continue to target price/mix to be up low double digits, with price/mix in the second half slowing sequentially from the 17% increase that we delivered in the first half as we lap more of last year's price actions. We continue to target our full year volume, excluding acquisitions, to be down mid-single digits compared with the prior year as we maintain our cautious view of the consumer.\nThat said, we expect year-over-year volume trends in each of our segments will continue to improve in the second half of the year as we lap some of the significant low-margin, low-profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last year, and as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business.\nWe expect volume growth to be positive in the fourth quarter. For earnings, we're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.54 to $1.62 billion. We're maintaining our EBITDA range target despite absorbing a $71 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes.\nWe're raising our adjusted diluted EPS estimate to $5.70 to $6.15 from our previous range of $5.50 to $5.95. The increase, which also includes the impact of the raw potato write-off is largely due to 2 items: First, we're reducing our SG&A target by $20 million to a range of $745 million to $755 million as we continue to manage our operating costs. And second, we're reducing our interest expense target by $15 million to $140 million as we expect to capitalize more interest associated with our capacity expansions.\nWe're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We reduced our depreciation and amortization expense by $20 million to $305 million. We also increased our capital expenditures target to $900 million to $950 million, up from our previous estimate of $800 million to $900 million to account for the timing of spending for our capacity expansion project.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Tom, let me give you a quick update on our ERP implementation. At the beginning of our fiscal third quarter, we transitioned some of our central systems in North America that manage supplier payments, inventories, warehousing, customer invoicing and customer shipments to SAP. We're experiencing the usual bumps associated with these highly challenging large-scale projects, but don't expect that the cutover will have a material impact on our full year business or operating results.\nThe estimated financial impact of the systems go live is included in our fiscal 2024 targets, including the impact of pausing production and increasing planned downtime at our processing facilities, followed by a gradual ramp-up of production and reduced shipments due to short-term inventory visibility challenges at our third-party finished goods warehouses in the period immediately following the cutover.\nAs a result of the increased production downtime, our third quarter gross margin, which is typically our strongest, will be pressured by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting reduced fixed cost coverage and other cost inefficiencies. With respect to sales, we expect the inventory visibility challenges that we experienced at the third-party warehouses to affect shipments and temper the sequential improvement in our third quarter volume trends. But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect positive year-over-year volume growth in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nI want to thank our customers in our warehousing and logistics service partners for working with us to manage through the transition. And most importantly, I want to thank our Lamb Weston team members that have been working tirelessly on this project, including throughout the holiday season. We will provide a further update on the transition of the central systems and processes as well as the general time line for implementing the new ERP system throughout our manufacturing network during our third quarter earnings call in April.\nIn summary, we delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth as we continue to execute our strategies, manage our portfolio mix and manage costs. We continue to expect volume trends to improve in the second half of the year while remaining cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer.\nAnd finally, we updated our earnings estimate for the year. including reaffirming our annual EBITDA range despite absorbing a write-off for excess raw potatoes and raising our annual EPS estimates to reflect lower SG&A and interest expense.\nLet me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we feel good about the overall health of the global category and the drivers for demand growth. We also feel good about our operating momentum and are confident in our ability to deliver our updated financial targets for the year. And finally, we believe that our focus on executing our strategies will continue to have us well positioned to drive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered a strong start to the year as we continue to execute on our strategies to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our integration of our EMEA operations is progressing well. Our capacity expansion in China is now up and running, and our other expansion and modernization efforts around the globe remain on track. Our supply chain teams continue to drive productivity savings, and our commercial teams remain focused on serving our customers and driving innovation across all channels.\nWhile our volume was down versus the prior year, it was in line with our expectations and was primarily driven by our decisions to exit lower priced, lower-margin business. We should see our year-over-year volume trends improve as the year progresses as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher-margin business. Overall, we feel good about the health of the category, our first quarter financial results and our operating momentum and have raised our sales and earnings targets for the year.\nLet me now turn to the current operating environment. The global frozen potato category continues to be solid with overall demand and supply balanced. Fry attachment rates, which is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets across our key markets, have remained largely steady and above pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic in our key markets was generally solid.\nIn the U.S., overall restaurant traffic was flat versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth offset further traffic declines in full-service restaurant channels. We believe that this is the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years, favoring QSR traffic and tempering full service and casual dining traffic.\nWhile overall traffic growth did slow sequentially from about 1% in our fiscal fourth quarter as quick service restaurant traffic growth cooled. Much of that weakness was in June, and we're encouraged that both QSR and full-service restaurant traffic trends improved as the quarter progressed. In Europe, restaurant traffic grew in many of our key markets. In the U.K., traffic was up mid-single digits, with growth in both QSR and full-service restaurants.\nGrowth was also solid in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In Asia, China restaurant traffic growth was very strong, but off depressed levels as the country rebounded from severe COVID-related restrictions. Traffic in Japan was solid in both QSR and full-service restaurants. We suspect that restaurant traffic trends will be volatile in the near term as high interest rates, high inflation and uncertainty continues to affect consumers.\nThat said, frozen potato demand has proven resilient during the most challenging economic times, and we continue to be confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category. Now with respect to costs. We continue to expect input cost inflation in the mid- to high single digits, largely driven by higher contract prices for potatoes, including a 20% increase in North America and a 35% to 40% increase in Europe. Much of our inflation-driven pricing across our channels has either already been announced or included in price escalators within existing contracts.\nCustomer contracts representing about 20% of our North American business are in the process of being finalized, and we feel good in the aggregate about the likely pricing and terms. Over the long term, we continue to expect pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements will be the primary levers to offset inflation. We'll also continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix to benefit sales growth and profitability.\nNow with respect to the upcoming potato crop. We are harvesting and processing the crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe. And we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest are in line with pre-pandemic historical averages. In Europe, we believe that the crop will also be in line with historical averages as a result of improved growing conditions. We'll provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performed out of stores when we report our second quarter results in early January.\nSo in summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter and continue to have good operating momentum. The overall category remains healthy with demand and supply largely balanced. And finally, at this time, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America or in Europe will be in line with pre-pandemic averages. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for the strong start to the year. Our performance speaks for itself, and it's a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire Lamb Weston team. We recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment, but the strong first quarter performance has allowed us to raise our fiscal 2024 financial targets.\nLet's start with reviewing our first quarter results. Compared with the prior year, sales increased $540 million or 48% to about $1.7 billion. About $375 million or 70% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from acquisitions with most coming from our EMEA business. We lapped the Argentina acquisition this quarter, but we'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA operations in the second and third quarters.\nAs a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from our acquisitions, net sales grew 15%. Price/mix was up 23% as we benefited from the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 in both our North America and International segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation.\nMix was also favorable as we continue to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. In addition, we estimate the price/mix in the quarter benefited by a couple of percentage points from lower-than-expected trade spending associated with pricing actions that we began implementing in the last month of fiscal 2023. This may be largely timing related, and as a result, could be a slight headwind as the year progresses. The trade spend benefit in the quarter, however, was mostly offset by a roughly 2-point headwind related to lower freight charges passed on to customers as transportation costs have come down from the prior year period.\nAs a reminder, our goal is to match freight charge to our customers with our transportation costs so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time. In line with expectations, overall sales volumes declined 8%. The decline was primarily due to our decisions to exit volume related primarily to 4 of our lower priced and lower margin contracts as part of our revenue growth management initiatives and to a lesser extent, continued inventory destocking by certain customers in international markets and in select U.S. retail channels also impacted volume.\nWe believe the effect of these destocking actions is largely behind us and should have little impact, if any, on our results going forward. It's important to note that volume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low. We expect our year-over-year volume trends to improve as the year progresses as we lap the volume we exited and backfill volume with higher-margin business.\nMoving on from sales. Gross profit in the quarter, excluding comparability items, increased $213 million to $490 million. Nearly 3/4 of the increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nThe remaining roughly 1/4 of the increase was attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Including the dilutive impact of the EMEA acquisition, our gross margin percentage, excluding comparability items, increased 480 basis points to 29.4%. While first quarter margins have historically been our lowest margin quarter, we estimate that the timing of trade spending that I mentioned earlier accounted for approximately 200 basis points of the increase, which would put our normalized first quarter gross margin, including acquisitions, approaching 28%.\nInput costs continue to increase mid- to high single digits on a per pound basis. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America. Higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy and ingredients for batter coatings. The increase was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower cost for edible oils and lower freight costs.\nSG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $45 million to $160 million. More than half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA. The remainder was largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure and to a lesser extent, higher compensation and benefit expenses and higher advertising and promotion expenses. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 76% to $413 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth, with the remainder attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA.\nMoving to our segments. This is the first quarter that we operated in our 2 new reporting segments, North America and international. Beginning with our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, sales were up 19% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 24%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels, the timing of trade spending and favorable mix as we benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives.\nLower freight revenue partially offset the increase. Volume in North America declined 5%. This primarily reflects our decisions to exit volume related primarily to 2 lower-priced and lower-margin contracts that largely began to impact our sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023. To a lesser extent, inventory destocking by certain customers and retail channels also pressured volumes. We don't anticipate further effects from the retail destocking after the first quarter.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA increased $148 million to $379 million as the carryover benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending and favorable mix more than offset higher cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Moving to our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America. Sales grew $360 million or 212% and included $375 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, net sales declined 9%.\nWhile price/mix was up 18%, driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as favorable mix, lower volume and freight revenue offset the increase. As expected, volume, excluding acquisitions, declined 27%. The decrease primarily reflects our decisions to exit 2 very low price, low margin accounts that largely began to impact our international sales volumes in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\nTo a lesser extent, continued inventory destocking also impacted volumes in the quarter. But as I mentioned earlier, we believe the effect of destocking is largely over. Despite a 27% decline in our International segment's volume, segment adjusted EBITDA increased $57 million to $90 million. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results as well as favorable price/mix drove most of the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher cost per pound and lower volumes in our legacy Lamb Weston business.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with more than $160 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion U.S. revolver. Our net debt was about $3.3 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 2.3x. We generated about $335 million of cash from operations or about $140 million more than the prior year quarter, largely due to the higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $305 million, which is up about $180 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to construction costs, as we continue to expand processing capacity in China, Idaho, Argentina and The Netherlands.\nDuring the quarter, we returned more than $140 million of cash to our shareholders, including $41 million in dividends. Most of the cash return was from repurchasing $100 million of shares. That's more than double what we repurchased in all of 2023 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price performance during our August open trading window. While our share buyback program is targeted to offset annual equity compensation dilution, we will continue to be opportunistic based on other capital allocation needs and the potential for generated solid returns based on our stock's trading value.\nTurning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Based on our strong first quarter performance, we raised our financial targets for the year. While we continue to expect macro operating conditions to remain challenging, the overall current demand and pricing environment remains solid. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America and Europe will be consistent with pre-pandemic historical averages. And we're generally pleased with how the discussions to renew remaining contracts are progressing in aggregate.\nSpecifically, we continue to expect strong net sales gains for the year and have increased our annual net sales target to $6.8 billion to $7 billion, which is up from our previous target of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to EMEA during the first 3 quarters of the year, which is up $100 million from our previous estimate. This represents a 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth, excluding acquisitions.\nFor the year, we're targeting price/mix to be up low double digits, which means that we expect price/mix will slow sequentially from the 23% increase that we delivered in the first quarter as we begin to lap some of our price actions that we began implementing in the second quarter of last year. While the overall potato category continues to be solid due to the timing of contract openers, we're targeting our full year volume, excluding acquisitions, to be down mid-single digits compared with the prior year. And we expect year-over-year volume trends will continue to improve as the year progresses as we lap some of the significant low margin, low product profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last yea rand as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business.\nFor earnings, we raised our adjusted EBITDA target by about $90 million to $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion. Using the midpoint of this updated range implies growth of about 26% or about $330 million versus the prior year. We left our target for SG&A unchanged at $765 million to $775 million. While our first quarter run rate suggests a lower target, we continue to anticipate spending will build as the year progresses.\nWe reduced our interest expense target by $10 million to $155 million as we expect to partially offset cash interest with more capitalized interest associated with our capacity expansion. Our other financial targets remain the same, including depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $325 million and capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million.\nIn summary, we're executing our strategies to deliver strong top and bottom line growth by improving our customer and product portfolio mix and offsetting input cost inflation through pricing actions and driving productivity savings across our supply chain. Volume elasticities in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low, and we expect volume trends to improve as the year progresses.\nWhile we remain cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer, we feel good about the start of the year and the health of the category, which gives us the confidence to raise our full year sales and earnings targets. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. We delivered a strong quarter and our operating momentum has us well positioned to deliver another year of solid sales and earnings growth. In addition, we're confident in the health of the global category and remain committed to investing in our business to drive sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nAnd finally, as you may know, we will be hosting an Investor Day on Wednesday, October 11 at the New York Stock Exchange. During the presentation, we'll discuss our view of the industry, our strategies for growth and our long-term financial targets and capital allocation policies. If you haven't already, please register if you plan on attending in-person as space is limited. Otherwise, you can view our presentation via our webcast, which you will be able to access through our website. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some highlights from the past year as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal 2024.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. I want to start by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for driving these results and their incredible commitment to supporting our customers. I'm proud of the work we did and continue to do to grow our business and build momentum as we enter a new year.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2023, we delivered record sales of nearly $5.4 billion and drove strong profit growth in each of our core business segments through a combination of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity. We acquired the remaining interest in our European joint venture, which added 1,500 new colleagues, 6 processing facilities and nearly 2 billion pounds of capacity. The business integration is well underway, and we believe this strategic transaction strengthens our capabilities to serve customers as a unified global Lamb Weston.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina, and we broke ground on a 250 million-pound capacity expansion, which will improve our ability to serve the growing South American market. We also made progress on major capital expansion projects in China, Idaho and the Netherlands, all of which are on track to be completed within the next 18 months. We opened an innovation center in Bergen op Zoom in The Netherlands, wherein close partnership with our innovation center in Richland, Washington, will develop and test new product and processing ideas for customers in Europe and around the world.\nWe launched new groundbreaking products with proprietary technologies that address customer and consumer needs in nontraditional frozen potato channels, such as pizza outlets, expanding our total addressable market. We further stabilized our supply chain by targeting staffing levels and managing through a second consecutive challenging crop cycle, all while executing productivity initiatives and upgrading capabilities at our processing facilities.\nWe continue to strengthen our operational infrastructure by completing the design work for the next phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll begin implementing this new system across a portion of our supply chain in North America later this year. And finally, we returned more than $190 million to shareholders, including increasing our dividend for the sixth straight year, and continuing to execute against our share repurchase plan.\nI'm especially proud that we delivered this performance in a highly challenging operating environment, and I'm excited to see what our Lamb Weston team can deliver in fiscal 2024 and beyond.\nLet me now turn to the current operating environment. The overall global frozen potato category remains healthy. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, was largely steady throughout fiscal 2023 and remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Servings in Europe and our other key international markets also held up well. However, the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years have continued to temper traffic in certain restaurant channels.\nIn the quarter, total restaurant traffic in the U.S. grew versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth more than offset declines in casual dining and full-service restaurants. However, total traffic growth decelerated sequentially each month during the fourth quarter as QSR traffic growth slowed and as traffic declines at casual dining and full-service restaurants softened further. Overall, restaurant traffic picked up in June behind strength in QSRs. However, traffic at casual dining and full service remain soft.\nWe expect that near-term demand may be somewhat choppy because of the variabilities of restaurant traffic trends and continued macro pressures on the consumer, which makes forecasting global demand for frozen potato is very difficult. As a result, we incorporated a cautious view of demand and volume when developing our fiscal 2024 financial targets. Despite this added volatility, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category and we'll continue to invest behind the capabilities to support that growth across our key markets.\nWith respect to costs and pricing, while we expect input cost inflation to moderate relative to the double-digit rates that we experienced in each of the last 2 fiscal years, we believe it will continue to have a meaningful impact on our cost structure. We expect most of our input cost inflation will be driven by higher contract prices for potatoes. In North America, we've agreed to a 20% increase for this crop -- this year's crop, while in Europe, we have agreed to an increase of 35% to 40%.\nWe believe the overall environment for inflation-driven pricing actions remains generally favorable. However, it's important to note that any price actions that we may take this year will likely be more modest than what we implemented in fiscal 2023. Given that, first, our pricing actions last year were intended to catch up to the effect of multiple years of high inflation. And second, we expect total input cost inflation to grow at a lower rate.\nAlthough we expect pricing actions will continue to be the primary lever to offset inflation over the long term, we'll continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix resulting from our revenue growth management initiatives as well as supply chain productivity to benefit sales growth and profitability.\nWith respect to the upcoming potato crop, we're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties, and initial indications are that this portion of the crop, which represents about 10% of our potato needs in North America this year, is broadly consistent with historical averages. At this time, the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest, that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages, as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable.\nIn Europe, a wet and cold spring impacted planning, which may delay the timing of the harvest in some of our growing regions. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nBefore Bernadette shares details on our fourth quarter financial performance and fiscal 2024 outlook, I'd like to update you on a change we're making to our reportable segments. Effective at the start of fiscal 2024, in connection with our recent acquisition and to align with our expanded global footprint, we began managing our business in 2 reportable segments: North America and International.\nThe North America segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, including our large multinational chain customers. The International segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels outside of North America. These 2 segments as well as our global supply chain will report to Mike Smith, our Chief Operating Officer. Mike's role is focused on execution and is designed to help us drive growth and unlock efficiencies by providing a truly end-to-end view of our global business.\nI'll continue to maintain responsibility for driving our long-term strategies and priorities, including allocating capital and resources to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders. We'll begin to provide our financial results under the new reportable segments with our first quarter results.\nSo in summary, we delivered a record year of sales and earnings growth, and continue to build operating momentum across each of our core segments. While near-term demand may be difficult to predict, the category remains healthy, and we remain confident about its long-term growth prospects. And finally, at this time, the potato crop in North America is largely in line with historical averages, while late planning may delay the harvest in Europe.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for finishing the year strong and setting us up well for fiscal 2024. Let's begin with our fourth quarter results.\nSales were up more than $540 million versus the prior year quarter or 47% to a quarterly record of just under $1.7 billion. That's at the high end of our targeted range for the quarter. About $380 million of the increase was attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA and Argentina operations. The EMEA amount is above the high end of the targeted $300 million to $325 million range for the quarter, reflecting a strong benefit from pricing actions.\nExcluding incremental sales from these acquisitions, net sales grew 14%. Price/mix was up 24% as we continued to benefit from pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 across each of our business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. As expected, price/mix in the quarter decelerated sequentially from the 30% or more increase that we delivered in our second and third quarters as we largely lapped all the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022.\nIn addition, we received no year-over-year benefits from freight rates charged to customers as we reduced these rates further to match the decline in our transportation costs. While we expect lower customer freight rates will soon become a year-over-year headwind for price/mix, -- our goal is to match these to our transportation costs so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time.\nOur overall sales volumes in the quarter declined 10% due to 4 factors. The first and primary driver was our continued effort to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business across our Domestic and International portfolio. Second, demand was tempered despite softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the U.S. This had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and drove much of the decline in that segment's volume in the quarter.\nThird, certain customers in international markets began to rightsize inventories after carrying unusually high levels of inventory to derisk their supply chains during the pandemic. And fourth, certain large retail customers temporarily lowered prices to rightsize inventories of private label products, delaying shipments of products that we produced on their behalf. In addition, we realized some acceptable levels of branded product volume elasticity in response to the inflation-driven pricing actions that we implemented over the past year.\nMoving on from sales. Our gross profit in the quarter, excluding comparability items, increased more than $170 million to nearly $425 million. About 40% of the increase was attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. The remainder was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nGross margin was up more than 300 basis points to 25.1% despite absorbing the dilutive impact on margin of the EMEA acquisition. Input costs increased high single digits on a per pound basis, easing somewhat from the double-digit inflation rate earlier in the year. The increase in cost per pound were again largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy, edible oils and ingredients for batter coatings.\nOur higher per pound cost also reflected reduced fixed cost coverage due to lower throughput, as we did take some extended downtime for planned maintenance in some of our production facilities; and increased write-downs of inventories, primarily consisting of bulk and obsolete finished goods. Our SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, increased $65 million to $183 million.\nAbout half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, while the other half was primarily driven by 3 factors: first, higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance; second, an $8 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses as we restore support behind our branded products in our Retail segment to historical levels; and third, higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure.\nAdjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $117 million or 59% to $318 million, with higher sales and gross profit driving the growth.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 85% in the quarter and included the $380 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Net sales, excluding the acquisitions, grew 17%. Price/mix was up 28%, which is largely comparable to the increases in the previous 2 quarters. The increase in price/mix reflects the carryover benefit of the domestic and international pricing actions that took effect in our fiscal second and third quarters.\nVolume declined 11%, and primarily reflecting the impact of exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in international and domestic markets, and the inventory destocking by certain customers and international markets that I mentioned earlier. Global's product contribution margin, excluding comparability items, increased about $145 million. More than half of the increase was from the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity, more than offsetting higher cost per pound and lower volumes. Incremental earnings from EMEA, which was above our target for the quarter, drove the remainder of the increase.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 4%, a notable deceleration versus the 17% that we delivered through the first 3 quarters of the year. Price/mix was up a healthy 13%, but lower than the 26% that we posted through the first 3 quarters, as we fully lapped our pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022 and realized no tailwind from transportation rates. As expected, the price increase that we began to implement in May only had a modest impact in the quarter, so we'll see more benefit come through in early fiscal 2024.\nSales volumes were down 9%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. We attribute most of the decline to the impact of softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic, although we also continue to realize the impact of exiting some lower-priced and lower-margin business. Foodservice's product contribution margin fell about $3 million. Lower volumes drove the decline as higher price mix more than offset the impact of higher cost per pound.\nSales in our Retail segment increased 25%. Price/mix increased 35%, driven by pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios that we began to implement in February to counter input cost inflation. Trade support during the quarter remained below historical levels given category demand. Volume fell 10%, largely reflecting the challenges that I described earlier for private label products. Retail's product contribution margin increased more than $40 million, and its margin percentage expanded 140 basis points to nearly 38%, as the cumulative benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions over the past couple of fiscal years more than offset higher cost per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $305 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion U.S. revolver. Our net debt was nearly $3.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Using EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which only includes a single quarter of EMEA's earnings, our leverage ratio is 2.6x.\nWe remain focused on creating value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive long-term growth as well as returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In fiscal '23, we generated more than $760 million of cash from operations or $340 million above last year, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures were about $735 million, which is up $430 million from the prior year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity. For the year, we returned more than $190 million of cash to shareholders, including $146 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We're taking a prudent approach to our financial targets for the year. Overall, we anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging, with inflation and other macro factors affecting our cost structure, restaurant traffic and consumer demand. In addition, we expect our capacity to produce coated fries, specialty cuts and chopped in form varieties, such as [ pumps ] and hash browns, will remain constrained until our new production facilities in China and Idaho become available late in fiscal 2024.\nFor the year, we are targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA transaction during the first 3 quarters of the year. And net sales growth, excluding acquisitions, of 6.5% to 8.5%, which is above our long-term sales growth algorithm of low to mid-single digits. Note that since we began to consolidate EMEA's sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline when calculating our sales growth.\nWe expect sales growth, excluding acquisitions, to be largely driven by pricing actions, including both the carryover impact of actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as any actions that we may take this year to counter input cost inflation. We also expect to deliver favorable customer and product mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives.\nAs Tom noted, while we expect a solid contribution from price, we do not expect pricing actions to be at the same level as fiscal 2023. Outside of those customer contracts in our Global segment that have yet to be fully priced, we expect any future pricing actions will be largely in line with the more modest rate of input cost inflation than what we've experienced in the past 2 fiscal years. In addition, transportation rates that we charge to customers will likely serve as a price headwind as we continue to adjust rates to reflect lower freight costs.\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect volume, excluding acquisitions, will continue to be pressured by our ongoing efforts to strategically manage product mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business. This strategy has proven to be beneficial to earnings, and we continue to see opportunities across our domestic and international channels. In addition, we're taking a cautious approach to consumer demand for 2 primary reasons.\nFirst, while QSR traffic has held up relatively well, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic trends have softened in the U.S. over the past few months. Second, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult due to conflicting data about the health of the consumer in the U.S., Europe and our key markets as a consequence of inflation, especially for food away from home, the expiration of temporary government assistance and other consumer support programs put in place during the pandemic, employment trends and other macroeconomic headwinds.\nDespite these near-term factors, we remain confident in the health and long-term growth prospects of the Global category, and we remain committed to investing in our people, production capacity and operations to support that growth.\nFor earnings in fiscal 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion, assuming potato crops in our primary growing regions are in line with historical averages. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of more than 20% or about $260 million versus the prior year. Looking at it another way, it's up $200 million more than our annualized second half of fiscal 2023 run rate of $1.325 billion.\nIn addition to incremental earnings from the Lamb Weston EMEA acquisition, we expect our earnings growth will be largely driven by higher sales and gross profit as we benefit from pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity.\nWe're projecting that the increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A of $765 million to $775 million, which is up about $200 million. In addition to inflation, the increase largely reflects incremental expenses attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations, increased investments to upgrade our information systems and ERP infrastructure, noncash amortization of intangible assets associated with the EMEA acquisition, as well as ERP investments we expect to place in service during the year, and higher compensation and benefit costs due to increased headcount to support our growing business.\nIn addition to our operating targets, we expect equity earnings, which includes our Lamb Weston RDO joint venture in Minnesota, to be $30 million to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million as we continue construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts, as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades.\nSo to summarize our fiscal 2024 outlook, we're targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, including $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations. We expect our sales growth, excluding acquisitions, will be largely driven by price/mix, with volume pressure due to our ongoing efforts to strategically manage customer and product mix and a cautious view of demand. And finally, we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of nearly $1.5 billion using the midpoint of our guidance, which is an increase of 20%, and largely driven by sales and gross profit growth.\nLastly, as Tom mentioned, effective the beginning of fiscal 2024, we began managing our operations as 2 business segments, North America and International. In the coming weeks, we'll provide recast financial information for fiscal years 2021, '22 and 2023 that is consistent with our new reporting segment structure, including quarterly results for the last 2 years.\nAnd with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are super proud of the team's strong performance in fiscal 2023 and believe that we're well positioned to execute our strategies to deliver our financial targets for fiscal 2024. We also remain committed to investing in our business to support customers around the world and drive people, new production capacity and operations to support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment while Bernadette will provide details on our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong results in our fiscal third quarter as we continue to build good operating momentum. Specifically, sales grew 31%, while gross margin expanded in each of our core business segments. This, in turn, drove strong EBITDA and earnings per share growth.\nI want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their dedication and focus on serving our customers so that together, we delivered another great quarter and positioned us for a strong finish to the year. This thank you is also to our more than 1,500 colleagues in Europe who are now officially members of the global Lamb Weston team after we recently completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Lamb Weston/Meijer. Lamb Weston Europe, Middle East and Africa, or Lamb Weston EMEA, adds 6 factories and about 2 billion pounds of production capacity to our global manufacturing footprint. It strengthens our ability to serve customers in key markets around the world, and it enhances a world-class management operating and commercial team with deep knowledge of the frozen potato industry. We've kicked off the process to integrate Lamb Weston EMEA's operations and are excited to see what we can deliver together both now and over the long term.\nBefore turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. While the macro environment remains highly challenging, overall French fry demand remains healthy. Total restaurant traffic improved versus the prior year quarter when traffic was negatively affected by the Omicron variant. QSR has essentially accounted for the entire growth in traffic, including strong growth across burger and chicken restaurant chains, which are significant contributors to driving fry demand.\nIn contrast, traffic at casual dining and full-service restaurants fell versus the prior year. This has a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and contributed in part to a decline in that segment's volume. The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets remain solid.\nAs we previously noted, we're encouraged by how the category is currently performing in away-from-home channels, but continue to expect restaurant traffic and demand trends will be volatile through fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024 as consumers continue to deal with a challenging macro environment. Demand for fries in food and home channels remain solid. Shipments by our retail segment grew in the third quarter led by strong performance in products sold under licensed restaurant brands. We expect demand in this channel will remain solid into fiscal 2024.\nWith overall category demand holding up relatively well and as industry supply expected to be constrained for at least the next couple of years, we believe the environment for pricing actions to counter input cost inflation may remain generally favorable. In addition, we've been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities. We made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset input cost inflation to drive the recovery in our gross margins over the past year in each of our core business segments. Nonetheless, we're continuing to work on maximizing revenue and margin by further evaluating markets and sales channels by using a broader set of variables and leveraging data-backed insights on our customers and consumers.\nPricing in the quarter in our Global segment was in line with our expectation as we continue to incorporate new pricing structures for customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. Despite lapping some of the pricing actions we took in fiscal 2022, price/mix in both the Foodservice and retail segments in the quarter was better than we anticipated as we continued efforts to rationalize pricing structures and strategically improve customer and product mix across the respective portfolios.\nDuring the remainder of fiscal 2023, in our Global segment, we don't expect any additional notable pricing actions to take effect. In Foodservice, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in price/mix will decelerate as we continue to lap more of the fiscal 2022 pricing and mix improvement actions. And in Retail, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in price/mix will also decelerate as we continue to lap last year's pricing actions, although this will be tempered by a recent price increase that took effect towards the end of the third quarter.\nWith respect to the potato crop in North America, we believe we have secured enough open-market potatoes to meet our production forecast until the early potato varieties are harvested in July. We purchased open potatoes from growers in the Columbia Basin and Idaho, but also secured supply from as far away as the East Coast. This adds up to our potato costs through the first half of fiscal 2024.\nWith respect to the upcoming potato crop, as previously discussed, we've agreed to a nearly 20% increase in the contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia Basin and have locked in the targeted contracted acres to be planted in that region. We're in the process of securing most of the acres in our other growing regions in North America and expect to have this process completed shortly with contract prices largely in line with the 20% increase in the basin.\nIn Europe, we have secured the acres in our key growing regions and expect to complete the contracting process shortly. Like North America, contract prices are up significantly to reflect input cost inflation for growers.\nSo in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of sales and earnings growth, which has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the year and continue to build good operating momentum across each of our core segments. We're excited about more than 1,500 new Lamb Weston EMEA colleagues that have joined the global team and believe that leveraging EMEA's capabilities will help us better serve customers around the world.\nAnd finally, category demand remains healthy, and we believe that industry supply should remain constrained for at least the next couple of years.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated financial fiscal 2023 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for delivering another quarter of strong results and continuing to build good operating momentum across the company. This momentum has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the remainder of the year. I also want to add a warm welcome to the Lamb Weston EMEA team.\nLet's begin with our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter were up 31% to $1.25 billion. Price/mix was up 31% as we continued to benefit from pricing actions across each of our core business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022 as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year.\nOur overall sales volumes were flat. While we increased shipments to our large QSR chain customers and to retail customers in North America, which generally reflects demand and restaurant traffic trends that Tom described earlier, our growth in volume was offset by a couple of factors. First, we continued efforts to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower priced, lower margin business. Second, and to a lesser extent, softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic also affected volumes in the quarter, which is largely reflected in our Foodservice shipments.\nIt's worth noting that in the quarter, we also continued to make progress in stabilizing our supply chain with better availability of production team members and key ingredients as well as improved production forecasting. As a result, the impact on production in the quarter was relatively modest, which helped drive improvements in our customer fill rates versus our first and second quarters. This improvement is more apparent in our Retail and Foodservice segments as we have largely maintained high fill rates in our global segment since the start of the pandemic.\nThat said, we expect changes in product mix and consumer demand will continue to pressure our near-term production and therefore, shipments of high-demand products, including retail fries, premium fries and batter coated products. We expect this volume pressure and our ability to meet growing consumer demand will continue until our capacity investments in China, Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands become available over the next couple of years.\nGross profit in the quarter increased $177 million to nearly $400 million as a result of our sales growth and gross margins expanding 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 31.7%. Our strong gross margin performance reflects the cumulative benefit of executing pricing actions in each of our business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation as well as leveraging efforts to improve customer and product mix and supply chain productivity. On the cost side in the quarter, we again realized a double-digit increase in input and manufacturing cost per pound. This was largely driven by about a 20% increase in contracted prices for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open-market potato purchases -- due to poor yields from the calendar year 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and energy.\nIn contrast, our transportation costs fell in the quarter as industry rates for rail, trucking and ocean freight services continued their steady decline over the past couple of quarters. We are continuing to reduce our freight charges to customers to match the decline in costs, which will steadily reduce the tailwind from transport prices in our sales line. However, the impact on our gross profit over time, will be largely neutral.\nMoving on from gross profit. Our SG&A, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $49 million to $136 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance as well as actions to maintain competitive pay levels across our organization. We also had higher expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system and a $6 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses, largely behind support of our branded products in our Retail segment.\nEquity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $12 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Favorable price/mix, largely reflecting pricing actions in Europe drove the increase.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 33% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 33%, reflecting the revenue growth management initiatives and pricing actions to counter inflation that Tom described earlier. Global's volume was flat, solid growth of shipments to large QSR chain customers in North America was offset by the impact of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in international and domestic markets as we actively manage our customer mix. Global's product contribution margin increased to $168 million from a relatively weak prior year quarter, which at the time, reflected significant input and manufacturing cost increases and only a modest benefit from product pricing actions. Global segment's product contribution margin percentage in the quarter was 25.8%, which is back to its seasonal prepandemic level and was also a bit better than expected as we realize more benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for some customers than we originally anticipated.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 22%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 as well as the actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation. Sales volumes were down about 3%, primarily reflecting exiting of some lower priced, lower margin business to manage our customer and product mix as well as softer traffic in casual dining and full-service restaurants. Foodservices product contribution margin increased to $143 million or up 34% as the cumulative benefit from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nOur Retail segment delivered another strong quarter with sales up 50%. Price/mix increased 44%, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolio to counter inflation. This was aided in part by limited trade support given the strong category demand and constrained supply environment. Volume in this segment was up 6% behind better customer fill rates for our branded products. Private label volume was also up as we lapped the incremental losses of certain lower-priced and lower-margin products over the past couple of years. Retail's product contribution margin increased to $83 million, and its margin percentage topped 38% as the cumulative benefit from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing cost per pound. We're very pleased with how our Retail team has strengthened our market share, profitability and portfolio mix over the past couple of years, and we remain confident in our ability to remain the overall category leader.\nMoving to our liquidity position and our cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $675 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our cash balance was inflated as we did take on a new $450 million term loan at the end of January to fund most of the cash consideration for the EMEA transaction, which closed a couple of days into our fiscal fourth quarter. Our net debt was more than $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, resulting in a 2.3x leverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis. After accounting for the EMEA transaction, the estimated net debt at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter would be about $3.3 billion, resulting in a 2.6x leverage ratio using our updated fiscal 2023 earnings target and an annualized contribution from our EMEA operations.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareholders and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated about $335 million of cash from operations. That's about $160 million more than the first 3 quarters of last year. This is largely due to the higher earnings, partially offset by increased working capital. Capital expenditures were nearly $500 million, which is up about $270 million from the first 3 quarters of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina. In the first 3 quarters, we returned nearly $146 million of cash to shareholders including $106 million in dividends and about $41 million in share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to our 2023 outlook. Our updated targets include the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the year, we've increased our sales target to $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion, up from our previous target of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. About $300 million to $325 million of the increase reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. The additional $100 million to $150 million increase reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter, and our expected continued momentum in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the contribution from EMEA, we expect our net sales growth in the fourth quarter to be driven by price/mix as volumes will continue to be affected by certain -- exiting certain lower priced and lower margin volume business to strategically manage customer and product mix, and the potential for a slowdown in restaurant traffic and consumer demand. For earnings, we're targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50, that's up from our previous target of $3.75 to $4.\nAnd adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. Of the $110 million to $130 million increase in our adjusted EBITDA target, we estimate that EMEA will contribute an incremental $10 million to $15 million of that amount. That implies then that EMEA's total EBITDA contribution of $20 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the normalized full year pre-pandemic EBITDA of about EUR 100 million. The additional $100 million to $115 million increase in our full year EBITDA target reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter, and our expected strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nIncluding the consolidation of EMEA, we're targeting a full year gross margin of 27% to 27.5%, implying a fourth quarter gross margin of 23% to 24.5%. Excluding EMEA, we've raised our full year gross margin target to 28% to 28.5%, up from our previous target of 27% to 28%. This implies a fourth quarter gross margin target, excluding EMEA of 25% to 27%. While this would be a healthy gross margin expansion versus the prior year quarter, it also implies a notable step down from our fiscal third quarter gross margin of 31.7%. We believe this estimate is prudent, reflecting typical seasonal patterns in our cost structure, significantly higher cost open market potatoes, continued inflation for key inputs and the impact of volume declines as a result of inflationary pressures on consumers.\nWith respect to SG&A, we expect expenses, excluding items impacting comparability of $550 million to $570 million. That's up from our previous target of $525 million to $550 million. The increase largely reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. In addition, we increased our estimate for capital expenditures to between $700 million to $725 million, up from our previous estimate of $475 million to $525 million. This increase reflects accelerated spending behind capital expansion investments as well as capital spending associated with the consolidation of EMEA. We also made adjustments to other financial targets, which you can find in our earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are executing in this challenging operating environment and are confident in our increased financial targets for the year. We also continue to feel good about growth trends in the category and believe that the investments we're making in our people, new production capacity and infrastructure will have us well positioned to support sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

Todays' conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today.

Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment while Bernadette will provide details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning. Happy New Year and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter as we continue to drive strong sales and earnings growth across each of our core segments. Our results reflect the successful execution of our strategies to counter the significant input cost inflation over the past couple of years through a combination of pricing actions, improving business and product mix, and adapting our manufacturing and supply chain to global challenges.\nSpecifically, we delivered sales of nearly $1.3 billion, a record high quarter, healthy gross margins in each of our core business segments and strong earnings, EBITDA and earnings per share growth. Because of our first half results and confidence in our business momentum, we've increased our sales, gross margin and earnings targets for fiscal 2023.\nI'm proud of our performance in the first half of the year and how the entire Lamb Weston team continues to focus on serving our customers and driving sustainable, profitable growth. Before turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. First, overall French fry demand in the U.S. remained solid, although the total restaurant traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels. It's up versus the prior year quarter, and trends are up sequentially off the lows we saw in the summer as gasoline prices spiked.\nDemand and traffic trends in the quarter varied by channel as consumers reacted to broad-based inflation and the threat of a recession. QSR traffic was up versus the prior year, and trends improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter as consumers adjusted to less expensive dining options. As expected, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the quarter was down versus the prior year, although trends also improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter.\nThis year-over-year decline in casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment, which has a greater exposure to these sales channels and contributed in part to a decline in the segment's volume. The fry-attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other Foodservice outlets, remained above pre-pandemic levels. The attachment rate in QSRs actually increased versus the prior year quarter which helped stabilize fry demand.\nOverall, we feel good about how the category and away-from-home channels is performing in this difficult macro environment but expect restaurant traffic demand trends will continue to be volatile through fiscal 2023. In contrast, retail fry demand remained solid in the quarter. It's been strong since the start of the pandemic as consumers pull back spending on dining out. Demand for our retail products sold under licensed restaurant brands, in particular, remained strong over the past year as consumers look to have the restaurant-style fries they love while at home.\nWhile fry demand across all our channels is holding up well, we continue to struggle to meet that demand due to the impact of supply-chain disruptions on run rate and throughput in our production facilities. Over the past year, these disruptions have been largely related to the impact of shortages in certain commodities, such as starches and edible oils as well as factory worker shortages and availability.\nThe availability of key commodities has slowly improved over the past couple of quarters as we broaden our supplier base and qualified substitute ingredients when possible. Yet it remains a concern, and we expect it will continue to affect our production volumes at least through the remainder of fiscal 2023. The availability of production team members has also steadily improved over the past couple of quarters, such that we're back to having staffing levels in most of our processing facilities at desired levels.\nHowever, run rate and throughput constraints will continue until our newly hired colleagues gain experience to optimize production. We've also experienced production constraints after adjusting operating procedures to reflect changes in product mix and consumer demand, including higher demand for retail fries, premium fries and batter-coated products. These products generally carry favorable margins. For example, to produce batter-coated fries, which is a high-growth and high-margin segment of the category, we typically run our lines at slower speeds, and we're producing uncoated straight cut fries. This results in reduced throughput. We also require more frequent and longer downtimes to clean and [sanitizing] lines between production runs when batter is used, which affects our run rates and line availability.\nTogether, this results in fewer finished pounds produced relative to making uncoated fries, which ultimately leads to pressure on our customer order fill rates. In short, we expect the impacts of ongoing commodity shortages, the onboarding of recently hired production team members and adjustments to optimize business mix to continue to pressure volume performance, and our ability to meet customer demand through the remainder of fiscal 2023 and until our capacity investments in China, Idaho and Argentina become available over the next couple of years.\nWith respect to pricing, we continue to drive pricing actions across our portfolio to counter input cost inflation. The environment remains generally favorable as a result of the solid category demand that I just described, coupled with constrained industry supply. Our Global segment led the way in the quarter with strong pricing through a combination of inflation-driven price escalators, new pricing structures for customer contract renewals, working with certain customers to accelerate pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years and improvements in customer mix.\nWe feel good about how Global's contract renewal negotiations played out this past year and expect this segment to continue to deliver strong price/mix growth as more of these updated pricing structures take effect in the second half. We also expect to drive solid price growth in both, the Foodservice and Retail segments in the second half of the year. Although the growth rate should decelerate as we begin to lap some of the pricing actions, we took in fiscal 2022. With respect to the potato crop, we've been processing potatoes from this year's harvest for the past few months and continue to assess the overall quality of the potatoes in our key growing regions, including shape, color, level of defects and solid content as consistent with historical averages.\nYields, however, are below historical averages and below the preliminary assessment that we provided during our earnings call in October. To fill our production needs, we have secured additional potatoes in the Columbia Basin and Idaho and are sourcing potatoes from other regions in North America, including the East Coast. This will add to our potato costs for the remainder of fiscal 2023, and we have included the estimated impact in our updated financial targets for the year.\nWith respect to next year's potato crop, we've agreed to nearly a 20% increase in contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia Basin and have secured the targeted number of acres to be planted. Our discussions with growers in Idaho and Alberta on price and acreage are ongoing. Now with respect to our acquisition of our partner's interest in Lamb Weston/Meijer, we expect the transaction will close during our fiscal fourth quarter after completing the regulatory review process. I'm excited about welcoming 1,500 value team members and beginning to capture strategic, commercial and operational benefits from the transaction, including, first, strengthening our global manufacturing footprint by leveraging Europe's low-cost infrastructure to serve key markets around the world as well as adopting best-in-class manufacturing practices to increase efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs.\nSecond, enhancing our customer-centric operating model by offering a single voice to our global customers and seamlessly supporting multinational customers with a truly global supply chain. Third, improving our position to further capitalize on growth opportunities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And fourth, pursuing our global growth strategies without the operating restrictions associated with the joint venture. So in summary, we drove strong sales and earnings growth in the second quarter and in the first half by executing on our strategies to price the counter inflation, improve mix, generate productivity savings and drive value for our customers.\nThe category is healthy with solid overall demand behind strength in QSR traffic and constrained industry supply. The quality of the recently harvested potato crop in the Pacific Northwest is good, and the impact from the shortfall in yields is manageable. And finally, we're confident about the strategic, operational and commercial benefits at the Lamb Weston/Meijer transaction has to offer. And we look forward to the transaction closing later this year.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Bernadette?\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our financial performance and operating momentum through the first half of the year, which has provided us with a strong foundation to raise our annual sales and earnings targets. Let me review our second quarter results before discussing our updated outlook.\nSales in the second quarter grew 27% to nearly $1.28 billion. That's a record for us. A 30% increase in price mix drove our sales growth as we continued to benefit from product and great pricing actions across each of our business segments. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022 as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year. The increase also reflects benefits from efforts to improve our portfolio mix. Sales volumes declined 3% as we continued to experience the supply-chain constraints and related shortfalls in order fulfillment that Tom described.\nThis primarily affected volumes and service levels in our Foodservice and Retail segments. To a lesser extent, volumes in the quarter were also impacted by softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic as well as the timing of replacing losses of some low-margin business in our Foodservice and Retail segments.\nGross profit in the quarter increased $176 million to $382 million, as a result of our sales growth and strong gross margin performance. Our margin expanded 950 basis points versus the prior year quarter and about 550 basis points sequentially to nearly 30%. Broadly speaking, pricing actions in each of our business segments, efforts to improve customer and product mix, and value created from our productivity programs have caught up to the cumulative effect of input and transportation cost inflation over the past couple of years.\nInput cost inflation, however, continues to be challenging. Once again, it was the primary driver of a double-digit increase in our manufacturing and distribution cost per pound in the quarter, largely due to higher prices for edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and transportation. Potato costs were also up as a consequence of the historically poor crop that was harvested last fall.\nWhile this is the last quarter that we will realize the financial impact from the 2021 crop, we expect our potato costs to continue to increase in the second half of this year as a result of higher contract prices and the need for significant open market purchases due to poor yields from the 2022 crop. We also continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with shortages of key ingredients and spare parts, onboarding newly hired production team members and other industry-wide supply-chain challenges.\nWhile the impacts from these constraints have been slowly easing, we expect they will continue to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $45 million to $136 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance and higher expenses relating to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system.\nEquity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $16 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Higher pricing, especially in Europe, drove the increase. Demand continued to hold up relatively well despite the impact of significant consumer inflation and volatile energy costs.\nThis sets Lamb Weston/Meijer up to deliver solid results in the second half of the year. Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 34% in the quarter behind a 31% increase in price/mix. As Tom noted earlier, most of the increase was driven by price escalators and updated pricing structures. With the increase in price/mix, Global's product contribution margin more than doubled to $171 million in the quarter.\nIn addition, Global's product contribution margin percentage approached pre-pandemic levels, which is a key milestone for our overall performance. While we were always confident that we would restore Global's margins, we knew it would take longer than in other segments due to the structure and terms of the channels' customer contracts. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 as well as actions taken earlier this year to counter inflation.\nSales volumes decreased 11%, primarily reflecting production constraints and to a lesser extent, softer traffic in casual dining and full-service restaurants. In addition, because of these production constraints, we've had to make some tough choices on customer service, which has resulted in the loss of some lower-margin business. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased 25% as the benefits from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nSales in our Retail segment increased 34% behind a 43% increase in price/mix, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios. Volume fell 9%, largely as a result of production constraints. It also reflects the incremental losses of certain lower-margin private label products. Through a combination of the team's strong execution of pricing and mix management, Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $66 million.\nIts production contribution margin percentage is now in line with our away-from-home channels. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $420 million of cash and $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our net debt was about $2.3 billion, resulting in a 2.4x leverage ratio. That's down from 3.1x at the end of fiscal 2022, reflecting our earnings recovery.\nIn the first half of the year, we generated about $290 million of cash from operations or about $80 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to the higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $270 million, which is up about $120 million from the first half of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina.\nAs a reminder, our annual maintenance capital expenditures have typically been about $120 million to $130 million as we generally target about 3% to 4% of sales. In the first half of the year, we returned nearly $100 million of cash to shareholders, including more than $70 million in dividends and $28 million in share repurchases.\nAs you may have seen a few weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to drive strong financial results and cash flow and our confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nSo now let's turn to the updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Please note that our updated targets do not reflect the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston/Meijer as that transaction has not yet closed. We believe the transaction will be completed during our fiscal fourth quarter. So for the year, we've increased our sales target to $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, which implies a growth rate of 17% to 19.5%. That's up from our previous target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion.\nWe expect that higher price/mix will be the primary driver of sales growth in the second half of the year. Forecasting volumes in the second half remains difficult as we anticipate shipments will continue to be affected by supply-chain constraints through fiscal 2023 and because of volatility surrounding a potential slowdown in restaurant traffic and demand as consumers face inflation and a weaker macroeconomic environment.\nFor earnings, we're targeting adjusted net income of $540 million to $580 million. That's up from our previous target of $360 million to $410 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75 to $4, up from our previous target of $2.45 to $2.85. And finally, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous estimate of $840 million to $910 million. We continue to expect the increase in our earnings will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion.\nWe're targeting gross margins during the second half of the year to be between 27% and 28%, which is in line with the more than 27% that we delivered in the first half and up from the 23% that we posted during the back half of fiscal 2022. We expect the seasonal, sequential quarterly cadence for gross margins will be less pronounced than in previous years. Specifically, we do not foresee much of the typical seasonal step-up in gross margin from Q2 to Q3 or much of the typical step down from Q3 to Q4 for a few reasons.\nFirst, beginning in the third quarter, we expect our raw potato costs to increase to reflect the approximately 20% increase in the contracted price of the recently harvested potato crop. In addition, we expect higher potato costs as a result of significant high-cost open market purchases. Second, we expect continued significant inflation for other key inputs during the second half of the year, especially for edible oils and ingredients for batter coatings.\nThird, we expect a more muted step-up in global pricing from Q2 to Q3 due to the acceleration of pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. And finally, we expect the year-over-year price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments will decelerate as we begin to lap actions taken in fiscal 2022.\nWith respect to SG&A, we expect expenses, excluding items impacting comparability of $525 million to $550 million. That's up from our previous target, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses, including increased incentive compensation expense due to improved operating performance as well as expenses for outside services, including support of our IT and ERP upgrades. Our [estimates] of other financial targets, including interest expense, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expenses and our effective tax rate are unchanged. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying, we're confident in our strategies and business momentum. And as a result, we've significantly increased our financial targets for the year. And we're also confident about the health and prospects of the category. And we believe that our capacity expansion and infrastructure investments will have us well positioned to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nOnce again, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for our success this quarter and their ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for joining our call today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our performance in the quarter. We drove strong sales growth, expanded our gross margin and nearly doubled adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures. Our results reflect our continued focus on implementing pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation, driving productivity and cost saving initiatives, increasing service levels for our customers in each of our sales channels and supporting our people and talent.\nWe built good operating momentum over the past few quarters by focusing on these near-term objectives, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the upper end of our sales and earning target ranges for the year.\nI'm especially proud that the Lamb Weston team has continued to generate solid results in a very difficult macroeconomic environment. We expect this environment to remain challenging, at least through fiscal 2023, as inflation, a growing threat of recession and industry-wide supply chain disruptions continue to pressure demand for fries as well as our cost structure.\nIt's no surprise that inflationary trends for food, energy and housing have affected restaurant traffic in the U.S. over the past 6 months. We saw similar restaurant traffic trends during the Great Recession as consumer discretionary income came under pressure. While traffic at quick service restaurants has held up relatively well, it has come at the expense of casual dining and full-service restaurants as consumers increasingly choose less expensive options when dining away from home.\nIn the past month or so, we've seen casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic tick up from summer lows, but traffic remains below levels achieved just prior to the war in Ukraine. Unlike traffic trends, fry demand continues to be solid when dining out. The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food-service outlets remains above pre pandemic levels. Fry demand in retail channels has also benefited as restaurant traffic slows.\nOverall, we expect volatility in restaurant traffic and demand trends will continue through fiscal 2023. But history has shown that this category is resilient during economic downturns. Although we may see some category weakness in the near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets.\nIn addition, as category growth returns to historical rates, we should be well positioned to capture at least our share of growth with our investments in new processing capacity in Idaho and China as well as our newly announced expansion in Argentina.\nWith respect to pricing, our overall price/mix growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. In our Foodservice and Retail segments, we continue to realize a carryover benefit of multiple product pricing actions that we have taken over the past 15 months and expect the benefit of these actions will continue to gradually build through the first half of fiscal 2023.\nIn our Global segment, we made good progress in increasing price/mix through price escalators included in multiyear contracts while also securing some price adjustments outside of these agreements. In addition, we've nearly completed negotiating contract renewals that represent about 1/3 of our Global segment volume. Overall, we feel good about how the discussions played out, and we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nFinally, with respect to this year's potato crop. Our preliminary view is the potato crop in our growing regions in the aggregate will be around the lower end of historical average range. Specifically, the overall quality of the crop, including shape, color, level of defects and solid content is good and consistent with historical averages. Yields, however, are below average. The unusually hot weather during August affected the growth of the potatoes and resulted in a greater-than-average proportion of potatoes failing to bulk up to the desired size.\nIn response, we've already begun to secure the additional potatoes needed to meet our production forecast and expect to purchase most of this from growers in the Columbia Basin in Idaho. That's in contrast to last year when we purchased potatoes at significant premiums to contracted prices and transported them from as far away as the East Coast.\nAs you may recall, our financial targets for the year were predicated in part on an average potato crop, and we believe this crop is broadly consistent with our expectations. While the low average yields will result in additional open market purchases at higher-than-contracted prices, we do not expect this to affect our ability to deliver our financial targets.\nTo be clear, we view this crop as significantly better than last year's, which was poor both in terms of yield and quality due to the prolonged extreme summer heat in the Pacific Northwest. We'll provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performs out of storage when we report our second quarter results in early January.\nSo in summary, we generated strong sales and earnings growth in the first quarter by executing pricing actions in each of our business segments and driving productivity savings. We expect restaurant traffic and fry demand will be volatile in the near term as consumers continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. And on a preliminary basis, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions are at the lower end of historical average range and that any effect on our operations or financial performance will be manageable.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our progress towards our fiscal 2023 financial commitments.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at the high end of our financial target ranges for the year. In the quarter, our sales grew 14% to more than $1.1 billion. Price/mix was up 19% as we continued to benefit from product and freight pricing actions that we announced last fiscal year and as we began to execute new pricing actions during the fiscal -- for the first quarter.\nOur sales volumes were down 5%, primarily reflecting the softer restaurant traffic trends in U.S. casual dining and full-service outlets that Tom described earlier as well as the timing of shipments to large chain restaurant customers. In Retail, while branded product volumes were up, overall Retail segment volumes were down with the ongoing effect of losing certain low-margin private label business. Sales volumes in Foodservice and Retail also continued to be affected by our inability to fully serve customer demand as a result of constrained production at our facilities.\nGross profit increased $122 million to $273 million in the quarter. Gross margin expanded nearly 900 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 230 basis points sequentially to more than 24%. Pricing actions and productivity savings drove these improvements, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes. Cost per pound increased high single digits, with inflation again accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings, labor and transportation were the primary drivers.\nPotato costs were also up as a result of the [poor] crop that was harvested last fall. We'll continue to realize the financial impact of this crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we sell the final finished goods produced from the crop. And finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts and ingredient shortages and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Benefits from our portfolio simplification and other cost mitigation efforts, however, offset some of these higher costs.\nMoving on from cost of sales, our SG&A increased $25 million to $116 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefits expense and expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing a new ERP system. Equity method earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe and the U.S. increased nearly $170 million. More than $140 million of the increase was related to the change in unrealized gains from mark-to-market adjustments related to changes in natural gas and electricity derivatives as commodity markets in Europe have experienced significant volatility.\nAnother $15 million of the increase relates to a gain recognized in connection with us acquiring an additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. Excluding these comparability items, as well as other mark-to-market adjustments not associated with natural gas and electricity derivatives, equity earnings increased $13 million. This largely reflects improved results in our joint venture in Europe.\nIn addition, in September, our European joint venture withdrew from its joint venture in Russia after receiving all regulatory approvals. In the prior year quarter, earnings from the Russia joint venture were not material. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, nearly doubled to $228 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share more than tripled to $0.75 per share. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion primarily drove the increases.\nMoving on to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 14%, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and higher prices charged for freight. Mix was also positive.\nOverall segment volumes declined 2% as North American volumes fell, primarily due to the timing of shipments to large QSR chain customers, including the effect of lapping a notable limited-time product offering in the prior year quarter. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, nearly doubled to $84 million. Favorable price/mix more than offset the impacts of higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%. Price/mix increased 26% as we continued to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 and earlier in the quarter to counter inflation. Sales volumes decreased 12% as casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic softened. While traffic trends progressively softened each month since the war in Ukraine began at the end of February, it began to tick upward in August.\nSales volumes were also affected by the timing of incremental losses of certain low-margin noncommercial business as well as our inability to fully serve demand as a result of constrained production. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose more than 40% to $138 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nIn our Retail segment, sales increased 28%. Price/mix was up 32%, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios as well as favorable mix with the sale of more branded products. Volume was down 4%, reflecting incremental losses of certain lower-margin private label products. We'll be lapping the last of that -- lost private label business in the second quarter. Sales volumes were also tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to the constrained production. Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $49 million behind pricing actions and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $485 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. While our net debt remained relatively flat at about $2.25 billion, our leverage ratio fell to 2.7x from 3.1x at the end of the fiscal 2022 as earnings grew. We generated more than $190 million of cash from operations, which is up about $30 million versus the prior year quarter, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures were about $120 million. That's up about $40 million as we continue to construct new french fry lines in Idaho and China. In addition, we paid about $42 million to acquire the additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. We now own 90% of that joint venture. We returned $64 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have about $240 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.\nTurning to our fiscal 2023 outlook. Our financial targets for the year remain unchanged as we continue to build our operating momentum. While the macro environment remains volatile, we're on track to deliver at the high end of our sales target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion with price driving the growth. We'll continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. And in our Global segment, we expect to see the benefit of pricing actions, including pricing structures for contract renewals billed as the year progresses.\nForecasting volume continues to remain more difficult due to the near-term volatility in restaurant traffic and demand. As we saw in the first quarter, we believe that consumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times will continue to affect overall demand as well as our sales channel and product mix, with QSRs and retail outlets benefiting at the expense of casual dining and full-service restaurants. In addition, we expect our sales volumes will be affected by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face disruptions and availability of key product inputs and spare parts.\nAdditionally, while labor and access to shipping containers have improved, we continue to see the impact of shortages. We're on track to deliver at the high end of the range of our earnings target, including adjusted net income of $360 million to $410 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.85, and adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures of $840 million to $910 million. These targets exclude the items impacting comparability that I described earlier.\nWe expect our earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect gross margins during the second half of fiscal '23 that approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26%, and we feel good about the 4 key factors underlying this target. First, as Tom noted, we believe the potato crops in our primary growing regions will be at the lower end of the historical average range, and that any effect on our operations and financial performance will be manageable.\nSecond, we're pleased with the continued progress in implementing pricing actions to counter cost inflation. Third, we're making steady progress in adding production workers in order to ease labor pressures in our factories. And finally, the availability of domestic rail and trucking assets as well as access to shipping containers continues to improve. While a broad rail strike has likely been averted, we continue to closely monitor the status of discussions with the West Coast Stock Workers Union and the impact of potential work slowdown or stoppage may have on our exports.\nWe continue to target SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which reflects higher compensation and benefits expenses to attract and retain talent, higher spending for our new ERP system and other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher advertising and promotion expenses as we look to return support back to historical levels and overall inflation for third-party services. We continue to expect equity earnings of $25 million to $30 million, excluding items impacting comparability but also expect increased volatility, given the likelihood of a poor crop in Europe as well as possible limitations on natural gas usage that may affect our production.\nIn addition, we believe that the severe inflation outlook for Europe will likely translate into more pressure on restaurant traffic and demand. Our estimates for our other financial targets are unchanged, including: capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, excluding acquisitions; interest expense of approximately $115 million; depreciation and amortization expense of about $210 million; and an effective tax rate, excluding items impacting comparability, of about 24%. Now here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we are managing well through this challenging environment and continue to build good operating momentum. We're well positioned to deliver at the upper end of our financial target ranges for the year, and we're making the necessary investments in our production capacity and operating infrastructure to support long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call.

Tom will provide some key highlights for fiscal 2022 as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, and I want to thank all my Lamb Weston colleagues for navigating through this difficult and volatile environment these past 2 years. We've worked together as a focused team to weather pandemic, supply chain, and macroeconomic headwinds while continuing to support our customers, improve our operations and execute on our long-term strategic objectives.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2022, we delivered a record year of $4.1 billion in sales, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and volume growth as restaurant traffic and demand for fries continued to recover from the depths of the pandemic. We implemented pricing actions across each of our sales channels to mitigate some of the highest input and transportation cost inflation that we've experienced in 40 years.\nThis helped to drive year-over-year gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, and we expect to realize a carryover benefit of these pricing actions in fiscal 2023. We simplified our portfolio by eliminating SKUs, [drove] productivity savings and work with our customers to secure product specification changes to offset much of the cost and operational impact of a historically poor potato crop. We also made tough, but necessary decisions around customers, sales channels, production and service levels and adopted tools and practices to better manage our customer and product portfolio.\nIn our production facilities, we continue to leverage our Lamb Weston operating culture and changed our ways of working, including how we manage crewing schedules. This helped to better attract and retain employees, and we're making progress in getting our facilities fully staffed.\nWe started up a new chopped and formed production line in Idaho and broke ground on our capacity expansion and modernization projects in Idaho and China. While our plant in China remains on track to be operational by mid fiscal 2024, we pushed back the completion of our new fry line in Idaho at least a few months to mid fiscal 2024 as a result of some equipment delays.\nWe completed the design work for the second phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll build and test the new system in fiscal 2023 and implement it in fiscal 2024 in a phased approach. We issued our third environmental, social and governance report, which has been prepared in accordance with leading industry standards such as the global reporting initiative. This report includes our progress towards specific ESG goals for 2030.\nWe refinanced more than $1.7 billion of senior notes, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our weighted average interest rate. And finally, we increased our dividend for the fifth straight year and stepped up share repurchases to boost capital return to shareholders. In our joint ventures, Lamb-Weston/Meijer announced its intention to withdraw from its joint venture in Russia in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the devastating humanitarian crisis, the war has created.\nIn July, we increased our interest in our joint venture in Argentina from 50% to 90% and will now consolidate its sales and earnings in our results. In short, we've been managing through a turbulent market to build good operating and financial momentum by controlling what we can control while continuing to best to support long-term growth.\nThat said, we expect the environment, going forward, will remain very challenging with inflation continuing to pose the biggest threat to our cost structure and fry demand. Although the cost of some inputs, such as edible oils, energy and transportation, have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years. Labor availability continues to be an issue while other key inputs, such as ingredients for fry coatings, remain costly and in short supply. As a result, we expect input, transportation and labor costs will be a significant headwind through fiscal 2023.\nRising food, energy and housing prices have also affected restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. in the past few months. While traffic at quick service restaurants, which account for more than 80% of fry servings, has held up fairly well. Traffic at casual dining and other full-service restaurants have softened recently as consumer scale back dining out occasions or shifted to QSRs.\nDespite pressure on overall restaurant traffic, the demand for fries remain solid as the fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, remains above pre-pandemic levels.\nGoing forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. will be choppy and less predictable in the near term as consumers face significant cost inflation.\nFry demand in retail channels, however, should continue to benefit if demand in out-of-home channels is pressured. Outside the U.S. Consumer demand trends in Europe have been similar to what we have experienced in the U.S. as a result of inflationary pressures, which will also likely lead to a more unpredictable operating environment in fiscal 2023.\nOutside of China, demand in Asia has been relatively stable. The recovery in demand in China has been uneven as the government there maintains a Zero-COVID policy. In addition, our shipments to Asia continued to be constrained by the limited availability of shipping containers, although that availability did improve somewhat in the fourth quarter.\nThe bottom line is that we're forecasting cost and demand in this near-term inflationary and volatile macroeconomic environment will be difficult and require us to remain flexible in managing our supply chain and commercial operations. Despite these short-term challenges, we're confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets.\nWith respect to pricing, our price/mix growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to execute on our product and freight pricing actions. In early July, we began implementing our fourth round of pricing in the past 12 months in our Foodservice and Retail segments. We expect to see the benefit of these pricing actions as well as the one that we took in April to gradually build as we progress through the first half of fiscal 2023.\nIn our Global segment, it's clear that in the back half of fiscal 2022, we benefited from price escalators included in multi-year agreements and had some success in securing price increases outside of these contractual escalators. However, it's equally clear that we have yet to fully offset inflation and other costs given the more rigid structures and terms of customer agreements in this segment, resulting in a 110 basis point decline in product contribution margin percentage in the fourth quarter.\nAs you may recall, most of our chain restaurant contracts in our Global segment are multi-year agreements, and we're in the process of negotiating renewals representing about 1/3 of our global segment volume this year. We're being aggressive in discussions with customers to secure price increases to offset inflationary pressures, so that we can gradually restore profitability towards pre-pandemic levels. We're also seeking to modify other key terms to reduce the chances of, again, facing a significant pricing lag to recover rising costs.\nFor those agreements up for renewal this year, we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023. However, it may take up to a couple of years before we can fully recover costs across our global segment customer portfolio. For those multi-year contracts that were renewed over the past couple of years, we'll continue to realize the price escalators embedded in those agreements.\nWith respect to this year's upcoming potato crop, we expect the crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta in the Midwest to be largely in line with historical averages. While cooler than average weather in the spring and early summer slowed the crops progression, it is largely caught up to historical average with warmer temperatures and sunny days in recent weeks. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nAs we've previously discussed, we've agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound, reflecting our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long term. We'll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as we begin to process the early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer.\nSo in summary, we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, including record-high sales in the fourth quarter and for the year. We continue to successfully execute pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts as we look to offset input cost inflation and the impact of a historically poor crop. We remain confident in the resiliency and the long-term prospects of the category, although near-term demand will likely be choppy and difficult to predict. And at this time, this year's crop is on track to be in line with historical averages.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by echoing Tom's comments and thanking our employees for their hard work and continued dedication to drive our solid operating and financial performance during these challenging times.\nWe delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 14% or a record $1.15 billion with all of the growth coming from price/mix as we continued to execute our previously announced pricing actions in each of our core business segments to offset cost inflation. Sales volumes declined 1%, primarily reflecting lower export volumes due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks.\nTotal North American volume grew this quarter behind strong sales to large chain restaurant customers. While consumer demand in our Foodservice and Retail channels also grew, our sales volumes to those customers fell as we were unable to fully serve this demand as a result of lower production run rates and throughput at our production facilities.\nFor the year, sales increased 12% to nearly $4.1 billion, a record high with price/mix up 9% and volume up 3%. Gross profit in the quarter increased $56 million and gross margin expanded 230 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 22%. Product and freight price increases drove the improvement, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes.\nCost per pound increased double digits for the fourth straight quarter with inflation accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs, such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging were the primary drivers. Labor costs were also notably up, reflecting broad competition for production team members.\nTransportation rates also rose sharply versus the prior year. Transport costs increased as we continue to rely on an unfavorable mix of higher-cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers. And as Tom mentioned, while the cost of some inputs and transportation have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years and will continue to pose a headwind through fiscal 2023.\nWe also continue to incur higher potato costs as a consequence of the poor crop that was harvested last fall. We will continue to realize the financial impact of this poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nAnd finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts and ingredient shortages, and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Increased downtimes associated with scheduled maintenance also reduced production run rates, lowering our fixed cost recovery. Partially offsetting these higher costs per pound were benefits from our portfolio simplification, cost mitigation and other productivity efforts.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter, largely due to higher incentive compensation expense and a $3.5 million contribution to our charitable foundation. Equity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina, declined $57 million. This included a $63 million noncash charge associated with the European joint venture's intent to withdraw from its joint venture that operates a production facility in Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine.\nExcluding the impact of this charge as well as mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts, equity earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 21% while adjusted diluted EPS rose 48%. Higher sales and gross margin expansion drove the increases.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 10% in the quarter. Price/mix drove the entire increase, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and higher prices charged for freight. Overall segment volume was flat. We drove solid growth in shipments to large QSR and casual dining chains in North America.\nHowever, this growth was offset by a more than 10% decline in international shipments, reflecting limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. While still down versus the prior year, international shipments improved sequentially versus a decline of 20% in the third quarter as more shipping containers were made available.\nGlobal's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, declined 1% to $56 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 21%. Price/mix increased 24% as we continue to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced earlier in the year to mitigate cost inflation.\nSales volumes decreased 3% as labor and commodity shortages as well as scheduled maintenance downtimes impacted run rates and throughput at our production facilities, creating the inability to fully serve customer demand. We did see sales volumes slow each successive month during the quarter as restaurant traffic, especially in casual dining, softened as consumers responded to accelerating inflation.\nFoodservices product contribution margin rose 47% to $142 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our Retail segment, sales increased 20%. Price was up 22%, reflecting product and freight pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios as well as favorable mix.\nVolume fell 2%, reflecting incremental losses of certain lower margin private label products. This was partially offset by higher shipments of branded products, although this growth was tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to lower production run rate. Retail's product contribution margin nearly doubled to $42 million behind pricing actions, favorable mix with the sales of more branded products and a $3 million decline in A&P expenses. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $525 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. We had net debt of about $2.2 billion, which corresponds to a 3.1x leverage ratio. For the year, we generated about $420 million of cash from operations, which is down about $135 million versus the prior year, largely due to higher working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the year were about $305 million. That's up about $145 million as we completed the chopped and formed line in Idaho and began construction of our capacity expansion in China. For the year, we returned nearly $290 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have just under $275 million of authorization (inaudible) program.\nNow turning to our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate the overall operating environment to continue to be challenging, with inflation continuing to affect our cost structure as well as consumer demand. Accordingly, we're taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 outlook. We're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, which implies a growth rate of 15% to 17%.\nWe expect that price will be the primary driver of sales growth as we continue to implement our previously announced pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments and secure price increases in contracts up for renewal with customers in our Global segment.\nWith respect to volume, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult. Overall, we expect U.S. demand to remain solid, but will also likely be affected by significant inflation that consumers are facing. In the event of an economic recession, we expect demand for french fries will be resilient, although with little to no growth. That's consistent with what we experienced during the great recession from 2008 to 2010.\nConsumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times may also have an effect on sales channel and product mix. QSRs and retail outlets may benefit, but this may be at the expense of casual dining establishments. We've already seen some indications of this in the past few months. In addition, we expect our volume growth will be limited by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face labor shortages, disruptions in the availability of key product inputs and spare parts and limited access to shipping containers for exports.\nFor earnings, we expect net income of $360 million to $410 million. Diluted EPS of $2.45 to $2.85, and adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of about 20% or about $150 million versus the prior year.\nWe expect the earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. Favorable price/mix and productivity savings should more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation inflation as well as the cost inefficiencies and potato crop challenges that pressured our results last year.\nDuring the first half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin to improve versus the first half of fiscal '22, but will continue to be pressured as compared to our normalized seasonal rates. This reflects the implementation of our pricing actions, lagging inflation as well as the impact of higher raw potato costs on a per pound basis due to the poor crop that we harvested last fall.\nWe also expect our gross margins will be pressured by ongoing industry-wide labor and logistics challenges. During the second half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin will approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26%, assuming four key factors.\nFirst, an average fall 2022 potato crop. As Tom noted, at this time, we believe the crop in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will be consistent with historical averages. Second, the continued successful implementation of our pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation. As our recent results have shown, we've been able to successfully increase price across our portfolio.\nThird, the continued easing of labor pressures that have affected our production run rates and throughput. While factory labor availability remains challenging, we feel good about the actions that we've put in place to attract and retain production workers.\nAnd finally, the continued easing of logistics pressures that have constrained our shipments, especially our exports. The availability of domestic rail and trucking assets has improved in the past few months, along with access to shipping containers. However, we're closely monitoring the recent expiration of the West Coast dock workers union contract and what impact, if any, may have on our exports.\nWe're projecting the strong increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which is about $100 million higher than fiscal 2022, using the midpoint of that range. The increase largely reflects higher compensation and benefit costs as we adjust our compensation packages to reflect a very competitive environment to attract and retain talent.\nAdditional headcount, recruiting, training, travel and meeting expenses as we look to fill open positions to support growth over the long term and continue to emerge from pandemic-related restrictions. Higher spending to build and test our new ERP system, in addition to other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher A&P expenses, predominantly in support of our retail segment and finally, overall inflation for third-party services.\nWe expect equity earnings to be $25 million to $30 million, which is up from about $16 million in fiscal 2022 after excluding the $27 million of mark-to-market commodity and currency contract gains as well as the impairment charge and about $10 million of earnings from the Russia joint venture.\nIn addition to our operating targets, we expect total interest expense of around $115 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. Total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $210 million and capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, which includes about $285 million for the construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades.\nFinally, as Tom noted, we recently acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina for $42 million and will now consolidate their results. We do not expect the joint venture to have a material contribution to either sales or earnings growth this year.\nSo looking at our fiscal 2023 outlook at a high level. We're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, largely driven by price/mix, and we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million, largely driven by strong sales growth as well as gross margins that approach a normalized annual run rate of 25% to 26% during the second half of the fiscal year. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022 by focusing on what we can control and have built good operating momentum as we enter a new year. We've taken a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 targets as we expect the operating and demand environment to remain highly challenging, and we're confident in the long-term prospects of the category and remain committed to executing on our strategies, and investing in our global network to support growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for, and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tho Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette then provide some details on our third quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. First of all, I want to thank all my colleagues for their continued dedication and perseverance to keep Lamb Weston as an industry leader and a strong business partner. Our solid financial results in the third quarter are a direct result of how well our manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams have remained focused on improving our operations and serving our customers during a challenging macro environment, which includes the impact of an exceptionally poor potato crop. We continue to be encouraged by strong french fry demand and feel good about our continued progress. Specifically, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and drove sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion, and we did this despite the impact of Omicron variant, slowing restaurant traffic and disrupting our production and distribution operations more than we expected.\nWe benefited from our previously announced pricing actions to mitigate the significant cost inflation across our supply chain. We've also been driving improvements in our manufacturing operations as we focus on what's in our control. This includes mitigating some of the effects of the poor potato crop with product specification changes and portfolio optimization work that we've discussed previously. Factory labor remains challenging as we remain below preferred staffing levels, but we're making steady progress in a highly difficult labor market. We're addressing the labor gap by focusing on retention and new ways of attracting talent. We'll continue to push hard on our staffing initiatives and are encouraged by the improvements we're seeing. However, it will take time to get all of our factory staff where they continue to be.\nLike others, we're managing through freight challenges, including both cost increases and shipping delays. The freight challenges are impacting our top line as it limits our ability to service full demand. This is caused by a lack of containers for international and domestic shipments and truck driver shortages. This, combined with higher fuel cost, has also increased our cost to liver products. We're continuing to navigate through these and other operating challenges and remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our capacity expansion investments in Idaho and China also remain on track, and will have us well positioned to support increasing customer demand over the long term.\nLet me provide some brief updates on the operating environment before turning the call over to Bernadette. Let's start with demand. In the U.S., overall (inaudible), restaurant traffic in our third quarter remained solid. Although it weakened temporarily as the Omicron variant spread quickly. Omicron's impact peaked in January and affected consumer traffic at both quick service and full-service restaurants. In addition, some restaurants closed temporarily or reduced operating hours due to staff shortages, which further impacted demand. Restaurant traffic, however, has rebounded to pre-Omicron levels. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic and remains above prepandemic levels. Going forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand for fries in the U.S. to remain strong. Although it may be more volatile in the near term as consumers face significant cost inflation, in contrast, fry demand in retail channels may continue to benefit if demand in out-of-home channels is affected.\nOutside the U.S., demand in Asia and Oceania remained stable. However, we have not been able to meet that demand due to the limited availability of shipping containers for export. While we expect overall demand in these regions to return to pre-pandemic levels, widespread COVID-related government restrictions in key markets such as China may lead to demand volatility in the near term.\nDemand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been fairly stable, although it was temporarily affected by the spread of Omicron during the quarter. As in the U.S., we expect demand in Europe may be volatile in the upcoming months as cost inflation and COVID variants temper restaurant traffic. So overall, we expect that demand in the near term will be choppy. We remain confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and our key international markets. With respect to pricing, our price/mix growth accelerated sequentially in the third quarter as we continued to execute on our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments to offset inflation, and as we began to implement pricing actions in our Global segment. Going forward, if we see further inflation, we're prepared to take additional pricing actions as well as drive opportunities to improve product and customer mix.\nTo that end, last week, we began implementing a note round of pricing actions in our Retail segment and Retail segments, and we expect to see the benefits of these actions gradually build over the next 6 months. In our Global segment, contracts representing about 1/3 of the segment's volume are up for regional this year. We've begun discussions with those customers and expect to have most of the contract terms agreed by early fall.\nWith respect to this year's upcoming potato crop, we've agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest. This increase reflects our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow, plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long term. We'll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we began to process the early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer.\nIn addition, over the past few months, we partnered with our growers to contract for acres that represent nearly all of our projected needs associated with this year's crop. The number of acres contracted assumes an average crop year. Planning of this year's potato crop started in March and typically concludes by the end of April, and we'll provide our usual crop updates during future quarterly earnings calls as the growing season progresses.\nFinally, our hearts go out to all the people affected by Russia invasion of Ukraine. Our exposure to Russia is indirect as it runs through our 50% ownership in Lamb-Weston/Meijer. Last month, the Russia JV began winding down production of Lamb Weston-branded products and paused construction of its previously announced capacity expansion. We continue to monitor the situation and any decisions regarding that operation will be made in conjunction with our partner in Europe.\nSo in summary, we feel good about our progress in the quarter, especially given the highly challenging operating environment, and we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts enabled us to drive sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion. We've agreed on contract price and acres to be planted for this year's potato crop, and we remain confident in the resiliency and long-term growth prospects of the category, although demand may be volatile in the near term.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Tom's comments thanking our employees. We appreciate your hard work and dedication. As Tom discussed, we feel good about the benefits from our pricing actions and cost savings efforts to offset much of the significant cost inflation that we've been experiencing. And I'm confident in our ability to continue to manage through this volatile business environment.\nSpecifically, in the quarter, our sales increased 7% to $955 million. Price/mix was up 12% as we continued to execute our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in each of our business segments to offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Most of the increase in the quarter reflects these pricing actions, while mix was also favorable. Sales volumes declined 5% as we were unable to fully serve market demand due to logistics constraints, especially for our international shipments as well as lower production run rates and throughput at our factories, resulting from labor shortages. Increased shipments in our Foodservice segment and to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that are served by our global segment, partially offset the volume decline.\nHowever, while volume increased in these channels, it was tempered by the Omicron variant's negative effect on restaurant traffic, on the availability of labor to keep restaurants open and on our production facilities and supply chain. Gross profit in the quarter increased $24 million. Product and freight price increases, along with favorable mix more than offset the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis, and lower sales volumes. We expanded gross margin by 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 270 basis points sequentially to more than 23%.\nLooking at our costs, double-digit inflation drove the increase in cost per pound for the third straight quarter and accounted essentially for all of the increase in the quarter. There were 4 key areas that drove the increase in cost. First, commodities played the biggest role, led by edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging. Labor costs also increased due to competition for factory workers. Second, transportation rates continue to climb due to the persistent disruption in global logistics networks. We also continue to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers. Third, we began to see higher potato costs resulting from the poor crop that was harvested last fall in our primary growing regions. The increase in potato costs reflects the impact of purchasing potatoes in the open market at a significant premium to contracted prices. Higher transportation costs for shipping potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America to our plants in the Pacific Northwest, lower potato utilization rates and running production lines at lower speeds to accommodate low-quality potatoes.\nThe increase in our potato costs, decrease in potato utilization rates and how the crop is performing in storage are all in line with the expectations that we shared with you last quarter, and we believe we've secured enough potatoes to deliver our volume forecast until we begin to harvest the early potato varieties in July. As a reminder, we will continue to realize the financial impact of this year's poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe final key area that drove the increase in costs are operational inefficiencies, explained by labor shortages, Omicron related absenteeism, especially in January and into early February, and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. This resulted in lower production run rates and throughput in our factories, leading to fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. As I'll discuss later, we'll continue to see the impact of these costs in the fourth quarter. The effect of lower potato utilization and production run rates in the third quarter was largely offset by a range of cost mitigation efforts, including eliminating underperforming SKUs, changes to product specifications and increased productivity savings from our [win is one] and other cost-saving initiatives.\nSo in short, we're managing well through this highly inflationary and poor potato crop environment. We feel good about how we are controlling those things that we can control, which led to the year-over-year and sequential gross margin expansion.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A declined $9 million in the quarter, largely due to lower consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those projects ended, the overall compensation and benefits expense and a $2 million decline in advertising and promotion expenses. The decline in SG&A was partially offset by higher information technology infrastructure costs, including cost to design the next release of a new enterprise resource planning system. Equity method earnings in the quarter were $30 million and included a $20 million unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. The large mark-to-market gain in the quarter primarily relates to changes in the value of natural gas derivatives at Lamb-Weston/Meijer as commodity markets there have experienced significant volatility.\nExcluding the impact of these mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $1 million versus the prior quarter. Favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes were largely offset by input inflation and higher manufacturing and distribution costs in both Europe and the U.S.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 2% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators. It also reflects higher prices charged for freight. Volume fell 6%. International shipments, which have historically accounted for about 40% of the segment's total volume, were down nearly 20% versus the prior year quarter due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. Sales volumes to North American large QSR and casual dining restaurant customers increased, but at a slower rate than previous quarters due to the Omicron's negative impact on consumer traffic. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses, declined 8% to $73 million.\nHigher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound as well as the impact of lower sales volumes more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix.\nMoving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 34%, with price/mix up 22% and volume up 12%. As expected, the rate of increase in Foodservice price mix accelerated sequentially to 22% in the third quarter from 8% in the second quarter as the benefits of the product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year to mitigate inflation continued to build. In addition, the increase reflects favorable product and customer mix.\nThe ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants, as well as from noncommercial customers drove a 12% increase in sales volumes. While our shipments to restaurants have essentially returned to prepandemic levels, our shipments to noncommercial channels have not yet fully rebounded. As with our sales to large chain restaurants in our Global segment, the Foodservice segment's volume growth was tempered by Omicron's negative impact on restaurant traffic and labor availability in those restaurants. In addition, manufacturing labor shortages and the effect of Omicron-related absenteeism, limited our ability to fully serve demand due to lower production run rates and throughput in our factories.\nFoodservice's product contribution margin rose 52% to $107 million, with favorable price, volume and mix more than offsetting higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our Retail segment, sales declined 12%, with volume down 24% and price/mix up 12%. The volume decline reflected 2 factors: First, more than half of the decline was due to incremental losses of certain lower-margin, private-label products; and second, despite solid category growth branded product volumes were down as labor and supply chain disruption limited our ability to service demand. The increase in price/mix was driven by product and freight pricing actions across our portfolio to offset inflation as well as favorable mix.\nRetail's product contribution margin declined 5% to $32 million. Lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the decline, which was partially offset by favorable price/mix and a $2 million decrease in A&P expenses.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with nearly $430 million in cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated about $175 million of cash from operations. That's down about $200 million versus the first 3 quarters of the prior year, due primarily to higher working capital and lower earnings. Year-to-date, we've spent more than $225 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China. We've also returned nearly $230 million of cash to our shareholders, including $103 million in dividends and $126 million in share repurchases. After repurchasing $50 million of shares in the third quarter, we have just under $300 million remaining under our buyback authorization.\nNow let's turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. We expect our full year sales growth to be above our long-term target of low- to mid-single digits. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be driven by price/mix as we continue to execute our previously announced product and transportation pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation. However, we expect sales volumes will continue to be pressured as export volumes remain constrained due to limited shipping container availability, supply chain volatility and labor shortages challenge run rates and throughput at our factories, and as restaurant traffic and consumer demand may slow due to inflation and the persistent effect of COVID variants in the U.S. and key international markets.\nIn addition, please note that we'll be lapping a high volume comparison in the prior year.\nWith respect to earnings for the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 19% to 20%. This update puts us at the high end of the 18% to 20% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We're comfortable to be at the higher end of that range. Because of our confidence in the pace and execution of product and freight price increases that we're currently implementing in the market, we have more clarity on the net impact in margin from this year's poor potato crop, and we're making steady progress in stabilizing our supply chain operations and driving savings behind our cost mitigation initiatives.\nBased on our updated full year estimate, we expect our gross margin in the fourth quarter to be 19% to 21%. That's down sequentially from the 23% we delivered in the third quarter and reflects, in part, our usual gross margin seasonality. It also includes the impact of significantly higher costs held in finished goods inventory that were produced during the third quarter. These costs were driven by incremental costs and inefficiencies associated with very high levels of Omicron-related factory worker absenteeism in January and February that resulted in broad-based production disruptions. Since we typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize these costs during our fiscal fourth quarter as that inventory is sold.\n[Below] gross margin, we expect our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter to step up to $105 million to $110 million as we continue to invest in the design and build of our new ERP system. We expect equity earnings, excluding the impact of any mark-to-market adjustments, will remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs in both Europe and the U.S.\nFor the year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the senior notes that we redeemed in the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. We've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures to $325 million from our previous target of $450 million to reflect the timing of expenditures related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho and China.\nSo in sum, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and expanded our gross margins behind our pricing actions and our cost mitigation efforts. For the year, we're targeting the upper end of our previous gross margin range due to our confidence in our pricing execution to offset inflation. The more clarity that we now have on our potato costs and the steady progress that we're making in stabilizing labor in our supply chain. Now here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying I am proud of how our Lamb Weston manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams are continuing to take the right operating steps to manage through this challenging business environment. We're on track to deliver on our targets for the year, and we remain committed to investing to support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with the improvement in our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as the progress in our financial performance in the quarter, and I'm proud of how Lamb Weston team has been able to navigate through this difficult macro environment. We generated strong sales, and solid demand across our food away-from-home channels drove volume growth, and the initial benefits of our recent pricing actions began to offset inflationary pressures. In addition, our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations are on track, including increasing staffing in our processing plants to improve production run rates and throughput.\nTogether, our sales and operating momentum drove sequential gross margin improvement in the quarter and have us well positioned to better manage the upcoming cost pressures from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop in the Pacific Northwest. While our operations and financial results are not yet where we want them to be, we're on track to deliver our financial targets for the year, and our investments in capacity and productivity will get us well positioned to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth over the long term.\nBefore Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our second quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment, starting with demand.\nIn the U.S., overall fry demand and restaurant traffic in the quarter remained solid, especially at quick service restaurants where demand has continued to be strong and above pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at full-service restaurants during the quarter was also solid but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic, though, has softened recently as the spread of COVID variants have tempered consumer demand for on-premise dining and as restaurants closed temporarily due to staff shortages. While we expect that COVID wave will continue to temper demand for on-premise dining in the near term, we do not anticipate that it will have a meaningful effect on traffic or demand at QSRs. Demand at noncommercial outlets also improved during the quarter but continued to be below pre-pandemic levels. As with on-premise dining, we expect the spread of COVID variants will affect near-term demand.\nThe fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, continue to be above pre-pandemic levels. This served to support our out-of-home fry demand in the quarter. The increase in the fry attachment rate has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic, and we do not see that changing in the near term. Fry demand in U.S. retail channels in the quarter was up mid-teens from pre-pandemic levels, and we anticipate it will remain strong in the near term as the pandemic continues to affect demand in out-of-home channels.\nNow outside the U.S. Demand in Asia and Oceania has been solid, although the lack of shipping containers and disruptions to ocean freight networks continues to hinder our ability to fully serve our customers in these markets. Demand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been solid, although consumer reaction and the effect of recently imposed government lockdowns may reverse some of the recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand in the near term.\nSo overall, we're encouraged by the resiliency of demand and the long-term trends for the category but expect that there will be some near-term softness with another COVID wave in the U.S. and our key international markets.\nWith respect to pricing, we're making good progress in implementing recent pricing actions to manage input cost inflation. In the second quarter, we began to see the initial benefits of the price increases that took effect in the summer in our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as in some of our international businesses. We expect the benefit of these prices will continue to build as the year progresses. In December, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. While these actions did not affect our second quarter results, we'll see a gradual benefit from them over the next 6 months.\nIn our Global segment, we saw some benefit of pricing actions in the second quarter but expect to see a greater impact during the back half of the year. This reflects price increases related to contract renewals as well as the benefit of price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. We expect these price increases across our business segments will, in aggregate, mitigate much but not all of our cost inflation pressures. We will continue to assess the pace and scope of further cost inflation, and we may take further price actions as the year progresses.\nWith respect to costs, input cost inflation remains the primary driver to the increase in our cost per pound in the quarter. Commodity and transportation costs were each up double digits, and we expect that trend will continue through fiscal 2022, especially as our raw potato costs significantly increased in the second half of the year. Outside of cost inflation, we're making good progress to stabilize our supply chain in order to improve cost, production run rates and throughput.\nWe've taken actions to simplify our manufacturing processes and drive savings through a series of productivity initiatives, eliminating underperforming SKUs and increasing potato utilization rates. Importantly, after making changes to how we staff production crews, compensation and other incentives, we steadily reduced our staffing shortfall. We're working to continue this positive trend but realize it's difficult in a very challenging labor environment. The pending implementation of government-mandated COVID testing and vaccine regulations may also slow our progress and that of our suppliers in attracting and retaining workers in the near term.\nNow turning to the crop. The yields and quality of the potato crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are well below average due to the extreme heat over the summer. Similar to prior years, we had contracted with farmers to purchase potatoes to meet our production needs, assuming an average crop year. But because of the extreme heat, the contracted acres yielded fewer potatoes, and the quality is also poor. As a result, we're purchasing our remaining potato needs in the open market to meet our production forecast. We were able to reduce the number of potatoes we'd otherwise have been required to purchase in the open market by successfully partnering with our customers to secure changes product specifications.\nGiven that raw potato supply is tight and that fry demand has largely recovered, we've been purchasing open potatoes at a premium to contracted potato prices. When possible, we've been securing them from our nearby growing regions, but we have also transported potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America which results in increased transportation costs. We included an estimate of these additional costs in our updated earnings outlook. We'll begin to see more of the financial impact of this year's poor crop, including the high cost of open market potatoes in our third quarter results.\nSo in summary, we feel good about our financial and operating progress in the quarter. The overall demand environment is solid but may soften in the near term due to another COVID wave, and we're pulling the right pricing and operating levers to manage through this challenging environment.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom discussed, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. We generated strong sales and solid demand across our restaurant and foodservice channels in North America, drove volume growth, and we implemented pricing actions. We believe our pricing and cost-mitigation actions have us positioned to navigate through this difficult operating environment and to support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nSpecifically, in the quarter, sales increased 12% to a little over $1 billion. This is only the fourth time in Lamb Weston's history that we topped $1 billion of sales in a quarter. Sales volumes were up 6%. Volume growth was driven by our Foodservice segment, which reflects the continued year-over-year recovery in on-premise dining and by strong shipments to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that is served by our Global segment. Sales volumes of branded products in our Retail segment were also up in the quarter, but the segment's overall volume declined due primarily to lower shipments of private label products.\nWhile our overall volume growth in the quarter was strong, it was tempered by industry-wide upstream and downstream supply chain constraints, including delays in the availability of spare parts, edible oils and other key materials to our factories as well labor shortages, which impacted production run rates and throughput at our processing plant.\nIn our Global segment, volume growth was also tempered by the limited availability of shipping containers and disruptions at ports and in ocean freight networks. We expect these production and logistics challenges as well as the near-term impact of COVID variants to limit our volume growth through at least the end of fiscal 2022.\nPrice/mix was up 6% as we realized benefits from our previously announced pricing actions in each of our 4 segments. As a reminder, we began implementing product pricing actions in the first quarter as the primary lever to offset inflationary cost pressures, and it generally takes a couple of quarters before these actions are fully realized in the marketplace. We've also taken actions to more frequently change the freight rates that we charge to customers, so they better reflect market rates. Historically, we only adjusted these rates once or twice a year. Most of the increase in price/mix in the quarter reflects these product and freight pricing actions with favorable mix providing only a modest benefit.\nGross profit in the quarter declined $18 million as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per-pound basis. Double-digit inflation for commodities and transportation costs accounted for almost 90% of the increase in cost per pound. Of the 2, commodities played a bigger role and were again led by edible oils, including canola oil, which nearly doubled versus the prior year quarter; ingredients, such as wheat and starches used to make batter; and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging.\nFreight costs rose, especially for ocean freight and trucking, as global logistics networks continued to struggle. Our costs also increased due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail in order to meet service obligations for certain customers.\nAs Tom mentioned, we also incurred higher cost per pound versus the prior year due to incremental costs and inefficiencies driven by lower production run rates and throughput at our factories which resulted in fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. Lost production days and unplanned downtimes were primarily due to labor shortages across our manufacturing network, including COVID-related absenteeism.\nWhile the cost drivers in the first 2 quarters of the year have been largely consistent, in the second quarter, we began to realize the initial benefits of the pricing and cost-mitigation actions that we discussed during our last earnings call. As a result of these efforts, gross margin increased sequentially versus the first quarter by 500 basis points to more than 20%. While pricing actions provided the larger lift to the sequential improvement to gross margins, our production run rates and throughput improved sequentially, primarily due to our efforts to stabilize factory labor. While still lower than average, labor retention rates improved modestly versus the first quarter, and the number of new applicants has been steady. With more stability, we, in turn, drove more factory throughput.\nFinally, our actions to optimize our portfolio are also providing benefit. We've eliminated underperforming SKUs to simplify our portfolio and increase throughput in our factories. We've also successfully partnered with our large customers to secure changes to product specifications to mitigate a portion of the operating impact of the poor quality of this year's potato crop.\nIn short, while our run rate and cost structure are not yet where we want them to be, we look forward to building on the notable sequential progress that we made in quarter and believe that we've positioned ourselves to manage through this challenging near-term increased cost and poor potato crop environment.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $7 million in the quarter, largely due to a couple of factors. First, it reflects higher labor and benefit costs and higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volumes. Second, it includes a $2.5 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as we stepped up support for our retail products. While these expenses are up compared with the prior year, they are still below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe increase in SG&A was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those consulting projects ended as well fewer expenses in the current quarter related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system. We had approximately $2 million of ERP-related expenses in the quarter, which consisted primarily of consulting expenses. That's down from about $5 million of similar-type expenses in the prior year quarter. We're resuming our efforts in the second half of fiscal 2022 to design the next phase of our new ERP system.\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.22, down $0.44. About $0.28 of the decline was related to costs associated with the redemption and write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes that were originally issued in connection with our spin-off from ConAgra in November 2016. We identified these costs as items impacting comparability in our non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50, which is down $0.16 due to lower income from operations and equity method earnings.\nMoving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 9% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 5%, reflecting a balance of higher prices charged for freight, pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators. Volume was up 4%. Higher shipments to large chain restaurant customers in North America drove the volume increase, while logistics constraints temper our international shipments. Overall, the Global segment's total shipments continued to trend above pre-pandemic levels. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expenses, declined 13% to $81 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes.\nMoving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 30% with volume, up 22%; and price/mix, up 8%. The ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as well as from noncommercial customers drove the increase in sales volumes. The initial benefits of product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year as well favorable mix drove the increase in price/mix. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 19% to $104 million as favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.\nMoving to our Retail segment. Sales increased 1%. Price/mix increased 5%, reflecting the initial benefits of pricing actions in our branded portfolio, higher prices charged for freight and improved mix. Sales volume declined 4% as an increase in branded product volume was more than offset by lower shipments of private label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low-margin business. Retail shipments in the quarter were also tempered by the industry-wide supply chain constraints and production disruptions that I discussed earlier. Retail's product contribution margin declined 29% to $21 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound, a $2 million increase in A&P expenses and lower sales volumes drove the decline.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our liquidity position remained strong. We ended the first half of fiscal 2022 with almost $625 million of cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. In the first half, we generated more than $205 million of cash from operations. That's down about $110 million versus the first half of the prior year due primarily to lower earnings.\nDuring the first half of the year, we spent nearly $150 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our chopped and formed expansion in American Falls, Idaho, and our new processing lines in American Falls in China. We continue to put significant effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track.\nIn the first half of the year, we returned $145 million to shareholders, including nearly $70 million in dividends and $76 million of share repurchases. This includes $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter alone. Last month, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which equates to approximately $144 million annually and a $250 million increase to our current share repurchase plan, reflecting our confidence in the long-term potential of our business. As a result, we have about $344 million authorized for share repurchases under the updated plan.\nAs I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we redeemed and issued nearly $1.7 billion of senior notes. In doing so, our average debt maturity increased from 4 years to more than 7 years, and we reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $8.5 million.\nWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: first, to reinvest in our business, both organically and with M&A; and then to return free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.\nNow turning to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our full year sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the third quarter, we anticipate price/mix will be up sequentially versus the 6% increase that we delivered in the second quarter as the benefit of previously announced product pricing actions in each of our core segments continues to build. We expect volume growth in the third quarter will decelerate sequentially versus the 6% we delivered in second quarter as a result of the near-term impact of COVID variants on restaurant traffic and demand, the macro industry supply chain constraints and labor challenges that will continue to affect production run rates and throughput in our factories and global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affect both domestic and export shipments. We expect further deceleration in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap some of the higher-volume comparisons from the prior year.\nWith respect to earnings, we continue to expect net income and adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will be pressured through fiscal 2022, reflecting significantly higher potato costs in the second half of the year, resulting from the poor crop; double-digit inflation for key production inputs and freight; and higher SG&A expenses.\nFor the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 600 to 700 basis points below our pre-pandemic margin rate of 25% to 26%, implying a target range of 18% to 20%. That's a change from the 17% to 21% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We narrowed the range for a number of reasons. First, we're confident about the pace and execution of the product and freight price increases that we are implementing in the market. Second, we expect to build upon the incremental progress that we made in the second quarter to stabilize our supply chain operations and drive savings behind our cost-mitigation initiatives. However, we expect that the improvement in our run rate, throughput and costs will continue to be gradual, reflecting the broader macro challenges facing the labor market that will likely persist through fiscal 2022. And third, we have greater clarity on the net cost impact from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop. As a reminder, we'll begin to realize the full financial impact of this year's poor potato crop in the third quarter and will continue to realize its effect through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nBelow gross margin, we expect our SG&A expenses to step up $100 million to $110 million in the third and fourth quarters as we begin to design the second phase of our new ERP project. Equity earnings will likely remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S.\nWe expect our interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes in the second quarter. We previously estimated interest expense to be approximately $115 million.\nOur estimates for total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and effective tax rate of approximately 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $450 million remains unchanged.\nSo in sum, we're seeing the benefit of our pricing actions which drove the sequential improvement in our top line and gross margin in the quarter. Along with our pricing actions, we're on track with our other cost-mitigation initiatives, positioning us to manage through the impact of the very poor crop. And finally, for fiscal 2022, we continue to expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, and we have enough clarity in our sales and cost outlook to narrow our previous target gross margin rate.\nNow here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying we are pleased with our progress in the quarter, and we're taking the right steps on pricing actions and in our supply chain operations to navigate through this difficult operating environment. We are on track to deliver on our targets for the year, and we believe we're on a path to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels after we get past the impact of the poor crop in the first half of fiscal 2023 and remain committed to investing support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

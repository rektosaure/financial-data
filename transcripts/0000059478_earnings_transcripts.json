[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Czapar\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly Company's Q3 2025 Earnings Call. I'm Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Louis Chair and CEO; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Screvoski, Chief Scientific Officer and President of William Immunology; Anne White, President of Blue Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly USA; and Global Customer capabilities; Jakeman Norton, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrick Golsen, President of Lilly International; and Ken Kuster, President of lid CardioMetabolic Health.\nWe're also joined by Mark Keeman, Susan Hagelin and Wes Paul, of the Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community, it is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave, we'll turn the call over to you.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nSorry. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it. Q3 was another strong quarter for Lilly. We made progress across all our strategic deliverables. We delivered compelling financial results, advanced our pipeline and achieved key milestones to expand our manufacturing footprint. This is all shown on Slide 6. In Q3, revenue grew 54% compared to the same period last year.\nRevenue from key products more than doubled as our medicines continued to increase their global impact. In the U.S., Lilly gained market share in the anchor tin analog market for the fifth consecutive quarter. Lilly medicines account for nearly 6 out of 10 prescriptions within this large and growing class. Outside the U.S., Montara performance accelerated, driven by robust uptake around the world. As a result of our strong financial performance, we raised our revenue and earnings per share guidance.\nLucas will cover this in more detail later in the call. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key milestones, including U.S. FDA approval or [indiscernible] under the brand name INLURIO for HR-positive, HER2-negative ESR1 mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The EU approved Kassunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, positive results from a Phase III trial of J. PICA in treatment of naive CLL, positive overall survival data for Verzenio in high-risk early breast cancer. Positive results from the second Phase III trial of orforgepron in obesity, enabling now global submissions to begin later this year. Positive results from 3 additional Phase III trials of aforgepron in type 2 diabetes, including 1 trial that demonstrated head-to-head superiority versus oral semaglutide. We also made good progress executing our manufacturing expansion agenda. We announced plans to build 2 new U.S. facilities that will make active pharmaceutical ingredients and the expansion of an existing facility in Puerto Rico.\nThe new facility in Virginia will support our bioconjugate and monoclonal antibody portfolio. And the new facility in Texas and the expansion in Puerto Rico will support our small molecule portfolio, including or [indiscernible]. We plan to announce updates on our 2 remaining new U.S. manufacturing facilities in the coming months. During the quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and executed approximately $700 million in share repurchases.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Lucas to review the Q3 results.\n\nLucas E. Montarce\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Dave. As shown on Slide 7, Q3 was another strong quarter of financial performance. Revenue grew 54% compared to Q3 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 83.6% in Q3, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the same quarter last year. This improvement was driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower realized prices.\nResearch and development expenses increased 27% driven by continued investments in our portfolio. We have initiated 16 new Phase III programs since the start of 2024 and continue to advance our pipeline. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 31% and as we continue to increase investment to support ongoing and future launches across therapeutic areas and geographies. Our non-GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R&D, marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 48.3%.\nPerformance margin increased by more than 8 percentage points from Q3 2024, driven by revenue growth. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased to $7.02 a inclusive of $0.71 of acquired R&D charges. This compares to $1.18 in Q3 2024, which included $3.08 of acquired IPR&D charges.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 45% in Q3, driven by strong volume growth of Sean and Monaro partially offset by a 15% decline in price. Price was negatively impacted by a favorable onetime adjustment to estimates for rebates and discounts in Q3 2024. Excluding this base period effect, U.S. price declined by high single digits.\nIn Europe, revenue increased by over 100% in constant currency, reflecting the strong uptake of Monzaro. Revenue was positively impacted by $380 million onetime benefit related to a milestone payment and business development. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 81% in constant currency. Japan, China and Rest of the World delivered constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 22% and 51%, respectively, driven by Montara volume growth.\nOn Slide 9, we provide an update on the performance of our key products, which accounted for $12 billion of revenue within the quarter. Beginning with immunology. [indiscernible] delivered strong performance in atopic dermatitis as U.S. total prescriptions increased by 41% compared to Q2 2025. We saw increased use in the first-line setting, which now accounts for more than 50% of new [indiscernible] patients. One continue a steady uptake and the newly published 4-year data in ulcerolitis show long-term safety and efficacy benefits. Within oncology, Chipeta continued to build momentum. Both in the marketplace and with new data from Phase III trials.\nDan will talk more about this later during the R&D update. Verzenio remains the market leader in the U.S. for the note positive high early breast cancer population, reflective of its position as standard of care in this setting. In the U.S., prescription grew by 3% compared to Q3 2024 and international volume grew by 14%. In neuroscience, [indiscernible] total prescription grew by 50% compared to Q2 2025 and continue to increase share of market versus the competition. We also recently received marketing authorization by the European Commission, and we are in active reimbursement discussion across Europe and expect launches beginning this quarter and throughout 2026.\nFinally, moving to cardiometabolic [indiscernible], SURMOUNT and Mounjaro both posted a strong global performance. Beginning outside the U.S., Mounjaro performance was robust. We have now launched in 55 countries in all major markets. We have seen a strong reception globally and have gained significant share in most major markets as a result. While obesity reimbursement remains limited internationally, we are encouraged by the strong uptake. Approximately 75% of Mounjaro revenue outside the U.S. is coming from people with obesity, paying out of pocket, demonstrating a high level of clinical need and high willingness to pay.\nMoving to the U.S., SURMOUNT prescription tripled in Q3 2025 compared to the same period last year. While the impact of the CVS template formulary change was disruptive to patients and physicians, the impact on SURMOUNT performance was modest. Share of total U.S. prescription in the branded and the obesity market declined by approximately 2 percentage points compared to Q2 2025.\nHowever, performance is back to Q2 levels and SURMOUNT exited Q3 with 71% share of new prescriptions. We saw strong uptake of 7 in vials, which comprise approximately 30% of total U.S. and prescriptions and over 45% of new prescriptions in Q3. Mounjaro posted robust Q3 in the U.S. as total prescriptions grew by over 60%. Mounjaro also gained share of market in the type 2 diabetes incretin analog market, increasing by 4 percentage points compared to Q2 2025. Mounjaro is the most widely prescribed Incretinsfor people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. As shown on Slide 10, the combined U.S. incretin and market growth was strong, increasing by 36% in Q3 compared to the same period in 2024.\nLilly Incretins gained share of market compared to Q2 2025 and approximately 2 out of every 3 new prescriptions in the Incretins analog market, Isalilimedicine.\nOn Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 12. We share our updated expectations for Lilly's 2025 financial results. Based on the strong underlying performance and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue range by over $2 billion and now anticipate our full year revenue will be between $63 billion and $63.5 billion. Given our updated expectations for revenue growth and performance margin over the first 9 months of the year, we now expect non-GAAP performance margin to be between 45% and 46% of revenue. On the bottom line, we have increased our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share and expect EPS of $23 to $23.70.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Scientific Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks, Lucas. Lilly R&D had another productive quarter. I'll summarize progress by therapeutic area, beginning with cardiometabolic health. Since our last call, we announced results from 4 additional positive Phase III trials for orpaglipron.\nOf note, one of those trials was attained too, in people with both obesity and type 2 diabetes. As a reminder, patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes are less responsive to weight loss on GLP-1 monotherapy than those without type 2 diabetes. For example, in the STEP 2 clinical trial of people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide at 2.4 milligrams and 1 milligram resulted in 10.6% weight loss and 7.6% weight loss, respectively.\nAs shown on Slide 13, the team 2 demonstrated 10.5% weight loss and 7.8% weight loss at the 36-milligram and 24-milligram doses of Orforglipron, respectively, aligned with our goal to deliver efficacy similar to injectable GLP-1 monotherapy in an easy-to-use daily pill. This trial completed the clinical package required to initiate global regulatory submissions for the treatment of obesity. These submissions are beginning imminently, and we anticipate launching Orfoglipron in the U.S. for treatment of obesity next year.\nWe also made great progress on Orforglipron for type 2 diabetes since the last call, with positive results from ACHIEVE-1 and ACHIEVE-3. Orforglipron demonstrated superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to dapaglflosin and ACHIEVE-2 and compared to oral semaglutide and ACHIEVE-3.\nAs shown on Slide 14, and ACHIEVE-3, both the 12-milligram and 36-milligram doses of Orforglipron were superior to the highest available dose of oral semaglutide on both A1c reduction and on weight loss. People taking Orforglipron saw an average A1c reduction of 2.2% from baseline and lost nearly 20 pounds on the highest dose of Orforglipron. We also announced results from ACHIEVE-5 which demonstrate that Orforglipron has the potential to provide benefit as an add-on therapy to titrated insulin glargine.\nWith 4 positive Phase III diabetes trials now completed. We believe Orforglipron has the potential to be a foundational treatment for type 2 diabetes. We now await results from ACHIEVE-4, which will trigger submission of Orforglipron for treatment of type 2 diabetes anticipated in the first half of 2026. With data from over 8,000 participants across 6 completed Phase III Orforglipron trials. We've observed benefits across multiple cardiometabolic health measures as well as consistent safety and tolerability.\nOverall, Orforglipron has delivered a profile consistent with our goal of developing an oral and scalable small molecule GLP-1 with efficacy, safety and tolerability comparable to injectable monotherapy GLP-1s for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Outside of the core registrational programs for these 2 important indications. We have several additional ongoing Phase III Orforglipron trials, shown on Slides 15 and 16, and including new Phase III starts for treatment of osteoarthritis pain and for treatment of stress urinary incontinence, a new indication that we think could benefit from weight loss seen with Orforglipron.\nThe next study to read out will be maintain the Phase III study of weight loss maintenance. This study is the first of its kind. It's designed to measure the impact of switching from injectable semaglutide or injectable tirzepatide to oral Orforglipron. Our goal in this novel trial is to measure what level of weight loss patients can maintain after switching from an injectable incretin to Orforglipron. Since the patients in this trial were previously escalated to a maximal tolerated dose of semaglutide or tirzepatide and treated for 72 weeks. This is a very ambitious trial.\nFor those people switching from tirzepatide, maintaining weight loss after switching to Orforglipron is a high bar given the strong efficacy of tirzepatide as a dual incretin agonist. As this trial includes moving patients off of an active therapy onto a placebo maintenance arm, the tan maintain allows patients who are randomized to placebo to switch to Orforglipron as a rescue therapy if weight regain exceeds a specified threshold. This will be a rich data package, and we look forward to seeing the results in the coming months, either late this year or early next year.\nMoving to retatrutide, our GIP GLP-1 glucagon triple agonist. We expect results from up to 6 Phase III studies by the end of 2026 and to support the obesity and related complications program called Triumph and the type 2 diabetes program called Transcend. With its first-of-a-kind triple acting mechanism. We expect retatrutide can deliver deeper and more rapid weight loss than existing obesity medicines even more than terzepatide. Of course, not all patients may need this potentially very high level of efficacy. And we believe retatrutide will likely be best suited for patients with a very high BMI or with obesity-related complications that require a high degree of weight loss. While the global development program for retatrutide includes people with a broad range of BMIs, spanning across overweight and obesity, we anticipate we'll be focused on the clinical profile of this medicine in patients where the clinical needs are at the highest.\nThe first trial to read [indiscernible] compares retatrutide to placebo in patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis pain. This 68-week study is designed primarily as a pain relief study to support an indication for treatment of knee osteoarthritis pain in combination with other trials in the Triumph program. We look forward to sharing top line results from Triumph 4 later this year. Given this is the first Phase III trial for retatrutide, we'll be cautious not to over extrapolate from these results.\nWe have 7 more Phase III trials reading out in 2026 and 2027. We and we'll likely need to see data from at least a few of these before we more fully understand the profile of this medicine across a wide range of patients. For the obesity indication specifically, we look forward to results from 3 additional Phase III studies in the second half of 2026.\nMoving now to muvalaplin, which is our once-daily oral small molecule inhibitor of lipoprotein A or LPA. LPA is a biomarker associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In Phase II, muvalaplin demonstrated over 85% reduction of this biomarker at the highest dose compared to placebo. Based on these data, we've now initiated a Phase III study in people with elevated LPA levels and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, known as the MOVE LPA trial.\nMuvalaplin is the first small molecule approach to LPA and our second program in Phase III development against this important target. In other updates from cardiometabolic health, we submitted our once-weekly insulin called insulin [ EpcotoraAlpha ] in the U.S. for treatment of type 2 diabetes and we announced plans to initiate 2 Phase III trials with baricitinib in type 1 diabetes. From the early phase portfolio, we look forward to presenting Phase II data from our selective amylin agonist [indiscernible] at Obesity Week in November.\nMoving to oncology. We're very pleased to have received U.S. FDA approval of imlunestrant under the brand name in L'Oreal as a monotherapy for ER-positive HER2-negative ESR1 mutated metastatic breast cancer. Imlunestrant is also being studied in an ongoing Phase III trial called EMVER-4, which compares imlunestrant to the standard of care endocrine therapy in high-risk early breast cancer. This 8,000-patient trial is the largest oncology trial we've ever conducted, and it is on track to be fully enrolled by early 2026.\nThe positive results in the metastatic setting provided an important signal that imlunestrant could have a role in early breast cancer, where we believe an oral SERD could have the largest patient impact. Also in oncology, we top lined the study readout from the third positive Phase III trial of pertibrutinib in the BRUIN CLL development program.\nIn BRUIN CLL-313, a trial of pirtobrutinib compared to chemoimmunotherapy in treatment naive CLL/SLL, pirtobrutinib demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. Pirtobrutinib demonstrated the most compelling effect size ever observed for a single BTK inhibitor in a treatment-naive CLL study compared to this compare. We look forward to sharing these data at an upcoming medical meeting. as we continue to build evidence supporting the potential role for pirtobrutinib in treatment-naive CLL. We expect these data in combination with BRUIN CLL-314 to form the basis of regulatory submissions globally. We also presented updates from our early-stage oncology portfolio at the recent European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, including data on our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor for people with advanced breast cancer and PI3 kinase alpha mutations or folate-receptor alpha antibody drug conjugate for treatment of ovarian cancer and [ vepugratinib ], our FGFR3 selective inhibitor for FGFR3 altered metastatic bladder cancer. We continue to be encouraged by the emerging clinical profiles we've observed across each of these 3 programs. And we plan to initiate Phase III trials for these medicines in 2026, if not sooner. In Neuroscience, we received the EU marketing authorization for [indiscernible].\nImportantly, this approval came with the modified citation dosing in the label, which is also approved in the U.S. and now approved in Japan. The modified dosing schedule is thus approved in most major geographies and we're pleased that it's being used to further lower the risk of ARIA. Our Phase III trial with [indiscernible] is also progressing well, and we've now completed enrollment in TrailRunner ALS3 which is evaluating subcutaneous romtanatug in treatment of preclinical Alzheimer's disease with a similar time-to-event design as we are pursuing with the ongoing Trailblazer IIIA trial for genenimab.\nSeparately, we're pleased to announce that we've initiated our Phase III program in alcohol use disorder with brenepatide, the GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist that we believe could have the optimal properties for neuroscience indications, growing evidence from real-world clinical studies suggest that incretin therapies may reduce cravings, an observation that is supported by nonclinical studies that show decreased dopamine release in reward pathways after treatment with incretin therapy.\nGiven the data we've observed thus far with brenepatide, we believe it has the potential to treat a range of diseases. We expect to initiate several additional Phase II and Phase III trials in the coming months. including testing this medicine in important but extremely challenging unmet medical needs, such as opioid use disorder.\nIn addition to neuroscience applications, we will test [indiscernible] in immunologic disease including a Phase II trial in asthma, which has recently begun enrolling patients. Also in immunology, new data were presented for lebrikizumab at the 2025 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. Lebrikizumab delivered durable disease control in people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, when dosing was reduced from once every 4 weeks to once every 8 weeks, reducing the number of maintenance doses to as few as 6 doses per year could provide flexibility and reduce the treatment burden on patients.\nWe've now submitted these data to the FDA for a potential label update and continue to explore opportunities for even less frequent dosing of this medicine for people with atopic dermatitis. While we continue to pursue innovative modalities across several immunological disorders, we're also developing combination therapies with the potential to deliver differentiated efficacy. We recently began 2 new studies combining mirikizumab with tirzepatide in people with ulcerative colitis and people with Crohn's disease. These 2 new studies complement the previously initiated together studies of ixekizumab plus tirzepatide in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We expect the first data from the Together trials to read out in the next 6 months.\nSlide 16 shows additional milestones and updates to our clinical portfolio. It has been a very productive period since our last earnings call, and we still have an ambitious R&D agenda for the last 2 months of 2025.\nSlide 17 shows the remaining list of potential key events expected yet this year.\nI'll now turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks a lot, Dan. A lot to talk about there in the pipeline. We're pleased with all the progress in 2025, and we've had another quarter of really strong execution both in driving the business results and making investments that will help us discover and develop new Lilly medicines help more people around the world.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will moderate our Q&A session.

Should you request assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2025 earnings call. I'm Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJoining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Eli Lilly's Chair and CEO; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Eli Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Eli Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yufa, President of Eli Lilly USA & Global Customer Capabilities; Jake Van Naarden, President of Eli Lilly Oncology; Patrick Johnson, President of Eli Lilly International; and Ken Custer, newly appointed President of Eli Lilly Cardiometabolic Health.\nWe're also joined by Mark Heeman, Susan Hedgeland, and Wai Wong of the Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results may differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide four.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note our commentary will focus on our Non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Q2 was a strong quarter. We delivered robust revenue growth, shared top-line clinical data from multiple phase III programs, and invested in several initiatives that will support our future growth. Today, we shared positive top-line data from the ATTAIN-1 for Orforglipron trial in people with obesity. In ATTAIN-1, patients taking the highest dose of Orforglipron lost more than 27 pounds, or 12.4% of their body weight. In addition, the safety and tolerability in ATTAIN-1 was consistent with the injectable GLP-1 class.\nOur Orforglipron also met all secondary endpoints in this study, improving key markers of metabolic health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation. This is the second positive phase III trial for our Orforglipron we've reported this year, and we're encouraged by these results. Our goal from the beginning was to create a medicine that has a clinical profile consistent with approved GLP-1s while offering the convenience of a once-daily pill and the production flexibility of small molecule chemistry to meet global demand.\nWe believe this medicine has the potential to make a significant impact on human health, and we will now work with urgency to submit our orforglipron around the world to meet the global challenge of obesity. On slide six, we list key Q2 financial metrics and highlight progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 2024, driven by our key products. These include Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio, and Zepbound.\nIn the US, we continue the robust uptake of Zepbound and Mounjaro, and Eli Lilly gained market share in the incretin analog class for the fourth quarter in a row. Mounjaro also recently became the market leader in the US in total prescriptions within the type 2 diabetes incretin market. Outside the US, we continue to launch Mounjaro in new countries. These include Mexico and Brazil most recently. We have now launched Mounjaro in most major markets. Q2 was also a quarter of continued investment for Eli Lilly.\nIn addition to increasing commercial activities to support our newest medicines, we started multiple new clinical programs. While the company is experiencing rapid revenue growth, we're also increasing our R&D investment as early phase program data continues to impress us and to support our future growth of the company. Our financial performance in the first half of 2025 was strong, and as a result, we raised our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Lucas will cover this in more detail during the financial update.\nIn addition to the results from ATTAIN-1, we achieved several key milestones since our last earnings call. These include the US FDA approval of a new dosing schedule for Kisunla, a positive European CHMP opinion for Kisunla, announced positive results in the SURPASS-CVOT Phase III trial for tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. We announced positive results in the BRUIN CLL-314 Phase III trial of pirtobrutinib in CLL/SLL, and we launched the two highest doses of Zepbound in vials in the United States.\nWe announced and closed the acquisition of SiteOne Therapeutics, which expands Eli Lilly's pain portfolio and adds a clinical stage non-opioid pain program to our mix, and Verve Therapeutics, which adds new genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease with potential to only be administered once in a person's lifetime. We made progress in Q2 and throughout H1 2025 to bring new manufacturing capacity online. We produced more than 1.6 times the amount of saleable incretin doses during H1 2025 when compared to H1 2024.\nThis includes a significant step-up in capacity from our recently constructed facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We will continue to bring more capacity online in H2 2025 and expect our production capabilities to increase further. We also plan to announce the location of two of our new US manufacturing facilities later this quarter. During the quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and executed approximately $700 million in share repurchases. Before I turn the call to Lucas, I'd like to offer some perspective on the drug pricing reform discussion that's going on.\nWhile we support the administration's position that medical research costs need to be shared more equitably across developed countries, it's also true that the US pharmaceutical market has significant defects which shift costs to consumers and increase red tape. These problems also require urgent reform and make apples-to-apples comparisons of ex-factory pricing inaccurate and misleading. At Eli Lilly, we've already implemented several initiatives which directly lower patient costs for our most commonly used medicines.\nWe operate a direct-to-consumer model at scale through Eli Lilly Direct, which provides more affordable access to Eli Lilly medicines. This includes our leading weight loss medication, Zepbound, at a discount of more than 50% off the list price. We also led in resolving insulin pricing issues in our country by reducing list prices by 70% and ensuring broad access to $35 monthly patient costs, including for Medicare. Negotiated prices in Europe come with broad access, low patient copays, and without administrative hurdles like prior authorizations.\nThere are also no intermediaries that distort prices, and hospitals do not seek profit by selling medicines and marking them up. If we import foreign price controls and insert them into a US system that isn't built to function for patients, we risk embracing the worst of two worlds: the low productivity and output of Europe's biopharma sector with the high out-of-pocket and distorted prices of the US insurance market. Both today's patients and the future of new cures and treatments will suffer, along with the United States' competitiveness.\nOf course, we will engage and are committed to working constructively with the administration to find solutions that both benefit patients while preserving the hope for tomorrow's cures and the scientific base that has made America the envy of all in global pharmaceutical innovation. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q2 results.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nEVP and CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. As shown on slide seven, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 85% in Q2, an increase of 3 percentage points versus the same quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved cost of production and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower realized prices.\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased by 30% as we continue to increase investment to support our newest launches across therapeutic areas and geographies. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher expenses for late-stage assets and additional investment in early-stage research. Our non-GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R&D, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 45.9%.\nPerformance margin increased by more than 6 percentage points from Q2 2024, driven by revenue growth. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.5%, consistent with Q2 2024. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 61% to $6.31, including a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR and D charges. This compares to $3.92 in Q2 2024, which also includes $0.14 of acquired IPR and D charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth.\nUS revenue increased 38% in Q2, driven by strong volume growth of Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by an 8% decline in price. In Europe, revenue grew 77% in constant currency, reflecting the strong uptake of Mounjaro. Japan revenue grew 7% in constant currency, driven by Mounjaro and Ebglyss. In China, revenue increased 19% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro.\nRevenue in the rest of the world decreased by 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by stocking in the base period related to Mounjaro launches in new markets. This impact was largely offset by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio this year. Slide nine provides an uptake of the performance of our key products. Beginning with immunology, Ebglyss continues to perform well in atopic dermatitis. New patient starts and revenue trends are strong, and total prescriptions have nearly doubled since Q1.\nWe also made progress securing access, and Ebglyss is now covered by all three of the largest pharmacy benefit managers that represent 90% of people with commercial insurance. For Omvoh, we are one full quarter into the launch in Crohn's disease and are making progress in a competitive market. The new Kisunla formulation is available in most major markets, and we are seeing positive trends in new patient starts in the US, Germany, Japan, and other international markets. Moving to oncology, physician feedback on Jaypirca continues to be very positive.\nWhile still only approving later lines of CLL and MCL, we have seen a strong uptake within the label population and encouraging trends regarding time on therapy. We continue to generate additional data in Phase III trials that we believe will support an expanded label and use in early settings. We recently announced positive results of BRUIN 314 in CLL/SLL, which is another positive step toward those goals. Verzenio global sales grew 12% in Q2, driven by volume growth.\nVerzenio continued to be the MBRx and TRx market leader in the US and a standard of care in high-risk early breast cancer. US prescriptions grew by 4% in Q2 compared to Q2 2024, and international volume grew by 18%. Within neuroscience, Kisunla is continuing a steady launch trajectory, and we are making significant progress in driving healthcare system readiness and adoption. In the US, we are seeing strong diagnostic growth driven by PET and the acceleration of blood biomarker tests. This momentum is leading to more people being diagnosed and accessing treatment.\nOver 1,500 physicians and 150 of the top healthcare organizations have started patients on Kisunla. Outside the US, efforts are progressing as well, with approval in 13 countries. In Europe, we anticipate approval and launch later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion. Finally, moving to cardiometabolic health, Mounjaro and Zepbound both deliver impressive performance. Mounjaro posted $5.2 billion of global sales and exited the quarter with more than 50% of new type 2 diabetes prescriptions in the US.\nMounjaro also became the US market leader in total type 2 diabetes prescriptions in July and has gained 8 percentage points in total prescription share of market during the first seven months of 2025. With the recently announced positive results from SURPASS-CVOT, we look forward to submitting this data to global regulators to support a label cardiovascular indication. Outside the US, tirzepatide is now launched in most major markets.\nAs a reminder, Mounjaro is marketed as a single brand for both chronic weight management and type 2 diabetes in all international markets except Canada and Japan. While the initial reception of recent launches in Mexico, Brazil, China, and India has been excellent, the commercial activities have been measured to ensure demand doesn't exceed supply and that patients and physicians have a good experience.\nZepbound's performance was strong in Q2, contributing $3.4 billion of sales. Zepbound continues to be the US market leader in the branded anti-obesity market, with two-thirds of total patients taking Zepbound. We recently launched the 12.5 and 15 milligram single-use vials in LillyDirect. All doses of Zepbound are not available in the vial presentation. While we work to secure broader investment of anti-obesity medicines, we are encouraged by the uptake of Zepbound in vials.\nThe cash-pay vials were approximately 20% of total US Zepbound prescriptions and over 35% of new prescriptions in Q2. As a reminder, effective 1 July, the CVS Pharmacy Benefit Manager began excluding Zepbound as an offering for patients on its formulary insurance plans. This has caused significant disruption to patients, and we strongly disagree with the decision to restrict access to medicines for patients. As demonstrated in randomized clinical trials, incretin medicines for chronic weight management are not all the same.\nWhile it's still early, we have seen this decision negatively impact Zepbound prescriptions during July and expect it to be a headwind to the rate of volume growth in Q3. We remain confident in the long-term growth outlook for Zepbound as the most widely used incretin therapy in the branded anti-obesity market. On slide 10, we provide a view on the US incretin analog market, which includes prescriptions for both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management.\nQ2 was another quarter of steady market growth as total prescriptions grew by 41% compared to Q2 2024. Lilly's performance was again strong, with share of market reaching above 57%, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to Q1 2025. While market growth continued to be robust, overall penetration into the addressable population is still low, and we believe significantly more patients can benefit from increasing therapy. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to slide 12 is our updated expectation for our 2025 financial performance.\nWe are encouraged by the underlying performance we saw across the business in the first half of the year. We are increasing the bottom and the top end of the revenue range, as well as our expectation for performance margins and earnings per share. We now anticipate our revenue will be between $60 and $62 billion. This range reflects the strong performance and a tailwind from foreign exchange rates. We will continue to invest to support our newest launches and to develop new medicines.\nGiven our updated expectations for revenue growth, we now expect non-GAAP performance margin to be between 43% and 45.5% as a percentage of revenue. The potential effect of tariffs remains dynamic, and we will continue to update our estimate as the situation changes. We expect the 2025 impact of currently announced tariffs to be modest, and this has been factored into our 2025 guidance range. At the bottom line, we have increased our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share and expect EPS of $21.75 to 23.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, we exceeded our increasing sellable doses production in the first half of the year and expect to bring more capacity online during the second half of 2025. We expect to produce at least 1.8 times the number of sellable incretin doses in the second half of 2025 compared to the second half of 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nEVP, CSO, CPO, and President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Thanks, Lucas. We've made quite a bit of progress since our last earnings call. During just the past two weeks, we shared three phase III readouts from some of our most important molecules. I'll start with these. Last week, we announced results from the tirzepatide SURPASS-CVOT trial, where tirzepatide demonstrated cardiovascular protection in a landmark head-to-head trial, which was the first-ever cardiovascular outcomes trial comparing two incretin therapies in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nIt included over 13,000 participants across 30 countries, and it is the largest and longest study of tirzepatide to date. As shown on slide 13, tirzepatide achieved the primary objective of the study, demonstrating non-inferiority compared to Trulicity with an 8% lower rate of MACE-3 events. tirzepatide showed consistent results across all three components of the MACE-3 composite endpoint. We were particularly impressed to see the rate of all-cause mortality was 16% lower on tirzepatide versus dulaglutide.\nBecause this trial did not include a placebo arm, we conducted a pre-specified indirect comparison analysis of matched patient-level data from the REWIND and SURPASS-CVOT studies. This analysis showed that tirzepatide reduced the risk of MACE-3 by 28% and reduced all-cause mortality by 39% compared to putative placebo.\nWe're very pleased with these results, which show that in addition to the well-established best-in-class weight loss and A1C control, tirzepatide now also provides a cardioprotective benefit and may provide more wide-reaching health improvements, including greater kidney protection and a reduced overall risk of death. We look forward to detailed results being presented at the EASD meeting in September and published in a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit these data to global regulators by the end of this year.\nThe SURPASS-CVOT results reinforce our enthusiasm for SURMOUNT-MMO, which enrolled over 15,000 participants with obesity and will assess the impact of tirzepatide on reducing morbidity and mortality. This is an event-based study, and the rate of accrual will dictate the timing of the readout. While SURPASS-CVOT and SURMOUNT-MMO are likely the largest randomized trials we'll conduct with tirzepatide, we'll still explore additional indications for this molecule, and we're excited to have started a new phase III trial in people with type 1 diabetes.\nMoving on to Orforglipron. As Dave mentioned, today, we're excited to announce top-line results from our second Orforglipron phase III trial, ATTAIN-1. This trial included people with obesity but without type 2 diabetes. As shown on slide 14, patients in ATTAIN-1 lost on average between 7.8% and 12.4% of their body weight after 72 weeks, depending on the dose. At the highest dose, the average participant on Orforglipron lost more than 27 pounds, and approximately 40% of people on this dose lost more than 15% of their body weight.\nWe also saw notable improvements on important drivers of cardiovascular risk, including non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. Moving to slide 15, we are very pleased with the safety profile of Orforglipron and ACHIEVE-1. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with the GLP-1 class. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low, with 5% to 10% of patients discontinuing Orforglipron across doses. There were no hepatic safety signals.\nWe look forward to sharing detailed results from ACHIEVE-1 also at the EASD meeting in September, and in a peer-reviewed publication. With today's readout, we've now seen results from two large phase III clinical trials involving over 3,600 participants, and we're highly encouraged with what we've seen thus far. The data from these first two pivotal studies provide evidence that a once-daily oral GLP-1 can achieve efficacy and safety in line with injectable GLP-1s.\nOrforglipron has the potential to be a more convenient alternative to injectable treatments and to be utilized to support early disease intervention in the primary care setting. With these data in hand, we're now working to move quickly towards our first regulatory submissions yet this year. We expect results from four additional Orforglipron on Phase III trials over the next five months, three trials in people with diabetes from our Achieve program, and one additional trial from the ATTAIN program in people with diabetes and obesity.\nATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2 will support global submissions for chronic weight management, which we expect in Q4. In addition to the ongoing Phase III trials for Orforglipron on diabetes, obesity, weight maintenance, and obstructive sleep apnea, we initiated a new program for Orforglipron on this quarter, ATTAIN hypertension, focused on reducing systolic blood pressure at 36 weeks as the primary endpoint.\nThis is the first study of orforglipron that includes patients with a baseline BMI as low as 25. We also announced plans to initiate a new phase III trial in people with knee osteoarthritis pain and overweight or obesity starting later this year. Moving to pirtobrutinib, we announced positive results from the BRUIN CLL-314 phase III trial of pirtobrutinib compared to ibrutinib in people with CLL/SLL. This trial included treatment naive patients as well as patients previously treated but not with a BTK inhibitor.\nPirtobrutinib met the primary endpoint of response rate non-inferiority compared to ibrutinib and had a nominal p-value for superiority that was less than 0.05. While progression-free survival data were immature, there was a positive trend in favor of pirtobrutinib. Additional testing for progression-free survival is planned as part of a future analysis. Of note, the subpopulation of treatment-naive patients had a particularly pronounced progression-free survival trend in favor of pirtobrutinib.\nThis subpopulation had the longest follow-up, which is encouraging for what we might see more broadly across the total study population over time. This is the second positive phase III trial to readout for pirtobrutinib as we continue to build evidence supporting the potential role for this medicine in earlier settings. We look forward to the readout of BRUIN CLL-313, which assesses pirtobrutinib versus chemoimmunotherapy in treatment-naive CLL/SLL later this year. We expect these data in combination with BRUIN CLL-314 to form the basis of regulatory submissions globally.\nIn addition to our recent phase III readouts, we also have updates on several other important molecules, donanemab, retatrutide, and olomorasib. For donanemab, we had three important milestones since our last earnings call. First, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU, and we look forward to approval and launch there later this year.\nSecond, the modified dosing schedule was approved in the US, further strengthening the safety profile for donanemab, and we expect the modified dosing regimen to be part of the EU labeling at launch as well. Finally, we shared long-term extension data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which demonstrated that over three years, donanemab-treated participants showed increasing clinical benefit despite most participants having completed treatment within the first 18 months of the trial.\nIn a separate part of the extension study, patients initiating donanemab after 18 months of placebo also demonstrated disease slowing once they started donanemab. These data reinforce the value of early intervention and support the limited-duration dosing approach with sustained and increasing long-term benefits for treatment. For retatrutide, we started a new phase III trial in chronic low back pain and overweight or obesity called TRIUMPH-7.\nThis is our second pain study for retatrutide in addition to the ongoing study in osteoarthritis pain of the knee, TRIUMPH-4, from which we expect results later this year. We are excited to announce plans to initiate a phase III study in high-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, later this year. This trial includes both retatrutide and tirzepatide, and it will utilize non-invasive tests to enroll patients who are at high risk of major adverse liver outcomes, with a primary objective of reducing the occurrence of such outcomes.\nThis novel trial design more closely mirrors how physicians diagnose this disease in clinical practice and will enable simultaneous development of both medicines, each compared to placebo. In a prior phase II trial in MASLD, retatrutide reduced liver fat by over 80%, and in a phase II trial in MASH, tirzepatide led to over half of patients meeting criteria for resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis. We believe each of these medicines has the potential to make a profound impact on this disease, and we look forward to initiating the study later this year.\nMoving to olomorasib, we started a phase III trial in unresected adjuvant lung cancer. This marks the fourth indication we are simultaneously pursuing for olomorasib in KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer as part of the SUNRAY-01 and SUNRAY-02 programs. We believe olomorasib, in combination with immuno-oncology agents in an early setting, could improve the standard of care for patients with KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer.\nI'm also excited that through business development, we've added new molecules to our portfolio and new colleagues to our team, and it's a pleasure to welcome new team members from SiteOne Therapeutics and Verve Therapeutics to Lilly this quarter. With SiteOne Therapeutics, we added a new pain asset into our neuroscience portfolio. STC-004 is a NAV1.8 inhibitor that's shown encouraging early data to treat pain. We believe this molecule could be an important non-opioid therapy for pain in the future.\nThrough the acquisition of Verve Therapeutics, we added several genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease that may only need to be given once in a lifetime. The most advanced programs are VERVE-102, which targets PCSK9, and VERVE-201, which targets ANGPTL3.\nIn our early phase portfolio, we advanced Nisotyrrostide, our PYY analog agonist, into a phase II trial in people with diabetes, and we initiated phase I clinical trials for glucose-sensing insulin, a PTK7 antibody drug conjugate in oncology, and a next-generation triple agonist in cardiometabolic health.\nWe also discontinued two phase II programs, KB1.3 antagonist for psoriasis and mazosotidine for pain, and two phase I programs, a CTLA-4 mimetic in immunology and SCAP1 siRNA in MASH. It was a productive period since our last earnings call, and we still have an ambitious R&D agenda for the last five months of 2025. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. We're really pleased with all the progress in Q2 across our strategic agenda. We've had another quarter of strong financial results.\nWe continued the build-out of our manufacturing footprint and advanced our pipeline, as Dan just highlighted, with external and internal R&D projects. We have good momentum as we enter the second half of 2025, and we're focused on execution with our currently marketed products, and we're investing in the next wave of medicines that we expect will drive growth in the near and more distant future. So now let me turn the call over to Mike to moderate a Q&A session.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So consistent with prior quarters, we will respond to one question per caller, and we'll end the call promptly at 9:30AM. Please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we are ready for the first caller.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions, please press Star 1one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing Star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we pull for questions. And the first question today is coming from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Just wanted to kick off with orforglipron. There's obviously a bit of a debate out there this morning on the weight loss profile you're showing for the product, which clearly looks efficacious but maybe a touch below Wegovy. Can you just help put the data into context and just in general your thinking of where Orforglipron fits into the treatment landscape versus Zepbound or Wegovy now that you have these results in hand? Thanks so much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Ken to answer the question about the Orforglipron profile.\n\nKen Custer\n\nEVP and President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris, for the question about Orforglipron. We're really pleased with the data we've disclosed this morning, really the idea that you can get 27 pounds of weight loss from a single pill and also get really encouraging effects on other important biomarkers, things like blood pressure, lipids, inflammatory biomarkers, and fasting glucose. Those are a lot of the things that HCPs are really managing when they think about preventative care. Now you're getting that all from a single oral pill that we can manufacture at scale.\nWe also know that simplicity matters in this space, and the instructions for use here are going to be pretty simple. Take it once a day without regard to food and water. Of course, the data we're sharing today are in patients with overweight and obesity, but we are evaluating orforglipron in a lot of other settings that includes other disease areas like diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and OA knee pain. But we're also evaluating it in other contexts for the treatment of obesity.\nRight now, we have the ATTAIN and MAINTAIN study ongoing, which is also testing orforglipron as a potential maintenance therapy for patients who have lost weight on drugs like Zepbound to see whether they can keep that weight off. So we really see a wide-ranging opportunity for orforglipron, and I couldn't be more pleased with the totality of the profile we disclosed this morning.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nExcellent. Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOh, great. Thanks so much for the question. Mine's actually on pricing and the pricing environment going forward. I was just hoping, Dave, you could discuss a little bit more your views on the path for price with orforglipron and the growing number of assets coming to market. I think that's been probably the number one overhang, especially as it relates to the continued availability of compounding.\nSo just trying to get a better understanding of where you see price going and maybe if you can provide some thoughts on compounding in that context and how you maintain tirzepatide compounding off-market when it's being ignored with semaglutide. Thanks so much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Seamus. Dave, we'll go to you to talk about the broader pricing environment and potentially weave in some compounding commentary.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Yeah, thanks, Seamus. As it relates to compounding, let me just deal with that first. We've always been concerned about this because of the patient safety risks that exist. And every day, we get calls from patients concerned that they are getting ill on a medicine they think is ours and it's not. This, of course, was allowed during drug shortage. There's no drug shortage. And we really think that regulators and law enforcement officers in the US need to step up their game to really eliminate this.\nThat's why we have an FDA and a structured regulatory process in the US. And so we want to see that end, mostly because people are being harmed. We see robust growth in the marketplace in the US, 42% total incretin growth over last year, good sequential growth. Of course, Lilly's growth is more than double that. So the business is fine, but people shouldn't be harmed. That said, I think on pricing, we've always had a philosophy across all medicines, including with incretins, to price to value.\nAnd given the profile we present, to consider offsetting other healthcare costs, including medicines, the value to the patient, the value in the economy as well. And here with GLP-1 and incretin mechanisms, we're seeing profound value, frankly. So we're noticing a difference in when we offer consumer-level pricing outside of insurance.\nBut inside of the healthcare system, which is most of the business, we think that we'll expect single-digit erosion like we do other chronic medications in net pricing, while maintaining a value point on lists that makes good sense. That's not considering any new policy environment, but that's our philosophy going forward.\nSo as we have a suite of products, some with perhaps more value in patients with more complicated obesity, or those that maybe have less complicated obesity, but medicines like Orforglipron that could reach the masses, of course, we'll consider those factors in price setting at the list level, and then the net will find its level in negotiations. And you can continue to expect Lilly to offer consumer-level pricing as long as we have such a large hole in coverage in our country for an important chronic disease like obesity that should be covered. Those are our views on pricing.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citi. Geoff, your line is live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Healthcare, Citibank\n\nGreat. Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Dan, on orforglipron, looking at discontinuation rates, it looks competitive for ATTAIN and ACHIEVE. But can you talk about how the GI adverse event rates change over the course of the studies? And were there common features among those with the highest adverse event rates, obviously thinking how this could play out from a commercial context? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Geoff. Dan, we'll go to you to talk about some of the orforglipron GI profile over time.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nEVP, CSO, CPO, and President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Geoff. No surprises in there. The GI profile was as expected for a GLP-1 agonist, which is to say that most of the side effects occur early in the treatment course or with dose escalations, and then they go down over time. In terms of any specific patient characteristics that predicted, I don't believe we saw that in the study, nor have we seen that in prior studies with GLP-1. So really, no differences here that we thought were noteworthy versus monotherapy GLP-1 injectables.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of US Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask; it's kind of a compounding question in a way, I guess. Canadian generics for Novo's semaglutide; they're likely to launch in early 2026. I think everyone can agree that tirzepatide is a better product. But won't this still cause a lot of trouble in the market where there's a big cash pay channel and where we already know that patients have proven themselves to be price-sensitive and willing to use a lesser product like a knockoff semaglutide?\nIt seems to me Canadian generics are just a replacement for that compounding channel, and they'll keep that headwind alive even if compounders get shut down. And we're talking about a product here that will have gone through a regulatory review cycle, not by FDA, but by another regulator. So with that launch six months away, is that a headwind that we should expect may continue? Thanks.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tim, for the question on the Canadian generics impact. We'll go to Ilya to answer that one.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll touch on what we're currently seeing in the US market. If you're assuming, looking at the self-pay market, that what we're seeing in vial performance and overall market is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. We're seeing that our offering with the vial with Zepbound and the profile that we have with Zepbound is meeting a need for patients even in the context of noise, whether you have compounded or semi in the market. You take a look at just the growth that we've seen in Q2.\nWe've generated over one million TRx in vial in Q2. We recently launched last week the highest doses of vial available for Zepbound. We're continuing to see health in that market. Roughly 20% of all of our TRx is coming from the cash pay market. We continue to see strength overall, both in self-pay and in covered. We're seeing around 65% share of market in new therapy starts for Zepbound overall. So we see health in the market and where Zepbound provides a greater value. Great.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Ilya. We'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Dave, your line is live.\n\nDave Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. So I was hoping to better understand the evolution of US employer coverage for anti-obesity medicines and the prospects. So my understanding is that coverage has been pretty flat on a net basis over the last 18 months, let's say, since January 2024, meaning the net covered lives has been flattish. If you can confirm that that's correct. And then can you talk about the outlook for the net change in US employer coverage for anti-obesity medicines over the next six months or so for January 2026? Thanks very much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave, for the question. We'll go to Ilya to talk about the progress in the Zepbound employer coverage option.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Dave. As we take a look at employer coverage, it's important for us to grow coverage over time. What we've seen in different offerings across the different plans, some are more complex than others. We've seen an increase overall, but it has been steady around 50% to 55% employer opt-in coverage. At the same time, we are seeing new benefit designs, like for instance, Evernorth, a cap on Out-of-Pocket for employees that make the prior authorization more simplified, and that may grow employer opt-ins over time.\nThat's something that we're working through. Our outlook is that as evidence grows and we find new ways and also different plan designs are available to different employers, that that will continue to increase.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ilya. We'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Pharma and Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on all the progress. Just wondering on orforglipron in light of the ATTAIN-1 data, if you can just frame expectations for us, Dan, for the upcoming ATTAIN 2 phase 3 data and then any early insights into the potential CMMI obesity Medicare/Medicaid pilot that I think we saw some press reports about. Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks. For that, we'll go to Ken to answer the question on expectations for ATTAIN 2.\n\nKen Custer\n\nEVP and President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Terence, for the question on ATTAIN 2. We're very pleased with what we disclosed this morning in ATTAIN-1, which is our first phase 3 study in obesity without diabetes. And of course, we had a great result with ACHIEVE 1 in patients with diabetes. So as we look ahead to ATTAIN 2, we expect similarly encouraging results. The exciting thing about ATTAIN 2 is that it'll be our third phase 3 study, and it sets us up to submit in obesity by the end of this year. So really, no change in expectations here.\nThe team's full speed ahead, preparing for submission by year-end and a potential approval next year.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue, Terence. We'll see if there's time for your second one. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, thank you so much for taking the question today. Just coming back to another question on orforglipron. As we've looked at kind of comparing the data between ATTAIN-1 and ACHIEVE 1, we do see that kind of nausea, vomiting, and constipation all appear a bit higher in this ACHIEVE 1 study. Can you talk a little bit about the differences in those data points that we're seeing between those two studies and what that might mean for adherence in the real world? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, Courtney, thanks for the question on comparing ACHIEVE versus ATTAIN. I think, Dan, maybe a couple of quick comments.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nEVP, CSO, CPO, and President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Courtney. I think the side effect profile in both of these trials was consistent with past experience for GLP-1 monotherapy in these populations, which are different, as you're pointing out. The side effect profiles can be different in people with type 2 diabetes versus people without type 2 diabetes and with obesity.\nSo I think we feel quite confident overall about the profile here. Of course, I think I'd just emphasize once again, this is a GLP-1 monotherapy. We know that dual agonism with GLP-1 and GIP can offer superior results. We have that as an injectable as tirzepatide. But I think actually this is as good as it gets for GLP-1 monotherapy here in a once-a-day small molecule oral. We're pretty excited with the profile.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dan, if you could comment on the gender split in the orforglipron study, if there was any difference versus any other trials for GLP-1 that you would want to highlight here. Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Mohit, for the detailed question. We'll go to Ken to talk about the gender split. Is there anything to flag?\n\nKen Custer\n\nEVP and President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Mohit. Gender split for baseline population in ATTAIN-1 was about 64% across the board, well-balanced across 64% female across all arms. Balance, nothing really to remark on here.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks again. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs. Asad, your line is live.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nHead of the US Healthcare Business Unit, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Just going back to channel dynamics, on the LillyDirect channel, clearly Zepbound growth has been getting a lot of momentum with the new-to-brand prescriptions. Where do you think this could stabilize and how is that segment changing the landscape on pricing?\nAnd then related, I think, Lucas, you previously framed this DTC offering for Zepbound as a hedge or a bridge solution as you continue to grow access in the reimbursed channel. So any evolution in your thinking on that front, given DTC offerings are now getting framed as one way to satisfy the administration's demands on drug pricing? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Thanks for the question, Asad. Lucas, you want to give some commentary on the LillyDirect sort of evolution and outlook from here?\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nEVP and CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. Thank you, Asad, for your question. First of all, I just wanted to highlight the great products that we see in LillyDirect. I think Ilya alluded about the total TRx prescriptions that we see in the second quarter, 1.1 million TRx. Fantastic growth. And now we are adding the 12.5 and 15 milligrams launch as well. So great progress that we are seeing. You see that data as well that you have access to, that in terms of the number of total TRx as a percentage of the total Zepbound business. So progressing very nicely. Very pleased with that.\nYou mentioned about, again, the hedge. Yes, I shared that with you a time ago. And that's the way that we think about it. Going back to the previous questions about employer, as we see that progressing, we always thought that it would be a gradual progression on the employer access. We see the LillyDirect as an option to bridge that, right, as a hedge strategy to bridge that. So we still see it the same way, but it's progressing very nicely and it's growing very it's actually contributing to our performance this quarter and for the rest of the year as well.\nSo that's more of the commentary and the color that we can provide today on that. Great.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Lucas. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is live.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nMorning, guys. I'm just still trying to get my head around the orforglipron data. On the one side, I see your efficacy estimate at 11.5% placebo-adjusted being very consistent with what Novo showed with their Oral SEMA data in OASIS 4. But on the more important ITT-like treatment estimate, orforglipron is tracking at 9% placebo-adjusted. Oral SEMA is almost 14% placebo-adjusted. And I'm just trying to understand what explains that delta, and does it prompt the need for a 45-milligram cohort considering how the safety is tracking?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Thanks, Umer. We'll go to Dan to provide maybe some final commentary on orforglipron.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nEVP, CSO, CPO, and President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Umer. I'm not sure I tracked exactly with your numbers. But look, I think overall, the profile here landed pretty much where you could expect a GLP-1 monotherapy to land. It's tough to compare different trials done at different time periods in different populations. But I think overall, given the patients we enrolled and the trial we ran, this is what GLP-1 agonism can give you. I don't see this as any issue at all in the real world or for patients or doctors.\nI know Wall Street has kind of focused on the exact numbers here and making cross-trial comparisons, but I don't think that carries over to the real world at all.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you. Thank you so much. With what is widely viewed as disappointing Orforglipron data, it seems injectables are where it's at for the foreseeable future. On the Q1 call, Lilly said the likely impact of the Novo deal with CVS would be modest. But today, you are saying there could be an impact in Q3. And for Lilly to call it out in the prepared remarks, it must be pretty meaningful. So can you tell us what changed in the marketplace for the injectables? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat, Steve. Thanks for the question. Maybe to give some commentary on CVS, we'll go to Ilya.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Steve, for the question. As we take a look at Q2 performance and the health of both the market and where Zepbound has gained share, and we added around 1.7 million TRx in Q2, the overall impact, I think what we discussed prior, is a couple hundred thousand TRx volume that may vary. It's still early in the transition to CVS, and obviously, that creates frustration for employers, for providers, for patients. And we don't agree and disappoint with CVS decision. At the same time, in terms of impact, you'll have some medical exceptions.\nAnd overall, in the context of growing 1.7 million TRx, we view, and you look at July TRx as a proxy where on average, it's back to around May average TRx, we see continued growth and very good performance across all segments for Zepbound, both in covered as well as our cash pay market. And so we expect continued growth. I think the commentary is more about the rate of growth. So obviously, some new patient starts related to CVS Caremark only may have some impact on growth, but overall, the growth is healthy across all other segments.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ilya. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research. Alex, your line is live.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nAnother one on orforglipron. So I noticed you included the total discontinuation rates in the PR when you normally don't. Does that suggest that you think there was an underlying driver of these unusually elevated dropout rates across all arms? And could they have impacted efficacy?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Alex. We'll go to Ken to talk about the inclusion of the overall discontinuation rates and how that may have been in some other press releases as well.\n\nKen Custer\n\nEVP and President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Alex, for the question on discontinuation rates. What we disclosed, of course, with the rate of discontinuation in ATTAIN-1 for placebo of 29.9% and then for orforglipron ranging from 22% to 24%, we don't think there's anything remarkable there. We've disclosed this information on previous Lilly programs. I think on SURMAT 1, we did. Maybe to put this in a little bit of context, if you look at analogous studies, obesity, really placebo rates are in the 20s.\nIf you take maybe STEP 1, 22% placebo rate for discontinuation and about five points lower for active comparator, that's exactly what we see here on a delta. So really nothing remarkable here. The more important thing to look at, of course, patients can discontinue a study for a whole host of reasons. They can just withdraw their consent because it doesn't fit with their life.\nMaybe they're not getting the efficacy they need, and that's why we typically see lower rates in the after drugs, which is what we see here, or an adverse event. Now, the rates for adverse events, as Dan noted, range between 5% and 10% for orforglipron. That's exactly where we'd expect to be for an oral GLP-1 single agonist. So really nothing remarkable here.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ken. We'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Akash Tewari from Geofferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. What's Lilly's appetite to committing to launching new products at net parity pricing between the US and Europe, given a significant amount of your newly launched products in Europe are actually not getting reimbursed anyway? And more broadly, it sounds like we're in an impasse between the administration and the industry. What's your confidence we'd be able to get kind of a bespoke solution with the administration absent new legislation? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Akash. We'll go to Dave to talk on the engagement with the administration and kind of new product launch strategy.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, just on the discrete question you're asking, I think we believe long-term we should rebalance pricing between US and Europe in terms of who's bearing the cost for really the amortized R&D and the risk we took. That's a rational thing. And it's, in my career, gotten more and more out of whack. So I think here the president's right to call that out. The question is really how. And as you know, the European governments don't exactly, they're not signing up to pay more for drugs. So we need trade tools to rebalance that equation.\nWe've been very clear on that advocacy with both European and US governments. In the US, we need to deflate the gross-to-net bubble because there's this huge artificial thing that needs to get deflated. The problem with doing that suddenly is all those cash flows into hospitals and premium support for seniors and Part D, et cetera, you can't collapse it all at once. It'd be very difficult, I think. So the idea of new products gives it sort of a ramp.\nBut we need these other structural changes on the US side and the gross-to-net environment in Europe in terms of the total reimbursement setup to get there. But we'd be excited to enter that world. And actually, I'll point out in a few cases, we are narrowing the gap substantially on new products.\nSome of that's for the reason you point out that some countries' reimbursement is just a tough equation. So what's the point of lowering that? So watch that space. I think this is an area there could be progress under the president's agenda. And I think you'd see most pharma companies interested in moving in that direction. The question is, how do you step into it?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dave. We got time for probably two more quick questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question, please. The next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you. Question from me on the cash channel. So yesterday, Novo stated it would make Ozempic available via its cash pay channel later this year. Are you planning to do the same for Mounjaro? And if not, why not? I'm not sure if you mentioned this earlier, but can you confirm whether you intend to use the cash channel for Orforglipron once that comes to market?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kerry, for the question. We'll go to Ilya to comment on our thoughts on the cash channel.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Well, first, I think we're learning a lot in the cash channel and LillyDirect. And a lot of that has to do with the consumer journey, and it's varied across different segments of where you have significant coverage versus not. And with Mounjaro, we have significant coverage, so over 90% coverage in both commercial as well as Part D. And so I'm not sure if that necessarily provides an additional avenue. With Zepbound, we see significant growth because we do have coverage gaps in commercial.\nAnd obviously, we also have coverage gaps without having the ability to cover anti-obesity medications in Part D. So we see this as an opportunity for us to meet that need. Of course, we'll evaluate other brands that we put through LillyDirect. We have a number of avenues to come to LillyDirect on different brands to make sure that people can access the healthcare system in a better way. And so that's something we'll evolve over time.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ilya. And last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question today will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Capital\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research and Senior Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. A follow-up on the MFN conversation. I appreciate it. You're not going to share the details of your interaction with the administration. But can you provide some practical examples of what you and the industry can do to help achieve the goals of getting price parity globally? Thank you so much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan. We'll go to Dave to answer the question and then to provide the closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. I don't have a lot to add to what I said to the prior question. I think long-term, it makes sense to rebalance this. And having an on-ramp makes sense to me because a sudden change in either environment would be difficult to sustain or justify. So the idea of new products is a reasonable proposition provided that the reimbursement rates in Europe can rise really based on cost-for-quality analysis and other things. And the US gross-to-net situation can change. And easing into it seems to be a rational thing to do.\nThe other piece, which the DTC channel being suggested by the administration, and for the prior question, in addition to offering an outlet for people who don't have coverage, it does provide a kind of real price transparency to consumers, employers, and others. And that's a good thing. So we support that as well. We'll have to see how this plays out. As I said, we're constructively engaging. Hopefully, some progress can be made. And I think it's in the industry's long-term interest to kind of pull these things closer together. And we'll work hard to try to do that.\nThanks for being with us today, everyone. And for as many questions as we got to, I know there's always some we did not. So as in prior quarters, if you have unresolved questions, please contact our IR team. And we appreciate your interest in the company, as always, and look forward to future interactions. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Should you require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2025 earnings call. I'm Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA.\nWe're also joined by Mark Cumin, Wes Taul, and Wai Wong of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide four.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Mike. Q1 was another exciting quarter. We increased our revenue, advanced our pipeline, invested to drive future growth, and shared the first Phase III clinical data from our oral GLP-1, Orforglipron. Dan will share more details during the R and D update, but we're pleased with the results from the Q1 trial for Orforglipron in patients with type two diabetes. These data met our expectations and are the first step to delivering our overall goal for the program, which is to create a medicine that offers injectable GLP-1-like efficacy, safety, and tolerability with the convenience of a once-daily pill that can be manufactured at scale to meet global demand.\nThis scientific breakthrough has the potential to eventually impact hundreds of millions of people around the world with chronic diseases, and we expect Phase III data from seven global clinical trials to read out over the next 12 months across type two diabetes and obesity. We also expect potential regulatory submissions for obesity to begin worldwide by the end of 2025. On slide six, we list Q1 financial metrics and highlight progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 45% compared to Q1 of 2024.\nOur key products, defined as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio, and Zepbound, grew by more than $4 billion and now account for $7.5 billion of revenue for the company. In addition to the Orforglipron readout, we achieved several other key pipeline milestones this quarter.\nThey include the approval of Jaypirca in the EU for CLL, the approval of Omvoh in the US, EU, and Japan for Crohn's disease, and the initiation of a Phase III program for Olemuracib in resected adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer. We also shared plans to more than double our manufacturing investment in the US. In total, we've announced over $50 billion of new US manufacturing investment since 2020, including our most recent announcement to build four new facilities, of which three will be API or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient facilities.\nLastly, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends in Q1 and executed a $1.2 billion share repurchase. We realize there's a lot of investor focus right now on tariffs and trade, so I'll make a few comments that reflect our current views on these complex and quite dynamic matters. We support the US government's goals to increase domestic investment.\nHowever, we don't believe tariffs are the right mechanism. Enhanced tax incentives and/or the extension of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act are better tools to achieve their goals. The announced tariffs currently in effect do not materially change Lilly's 2025 financial outlook. However, the expansion of tariffs in other geographies or increases in retaliatory tariffs would have a negative effect on Lilly and for our industry.\nAs a company, Lilly has a large US manufacturing footprint with 10 active projects ongoing to build and expand new sites. Upon completion of our manufacturing agenda, we will be able to supply medicines for the US market entirely from US facilities, as well as increase the volume of medicines we export. We will continue to execute our US manufacturing agenda.\nHowever, we urge the administration to negotiate deals with key trading partners as soon as possible that level the playing field for American exporters like Lilly and remove harmful tariffs and non-tariff market access barriers in the developed economies. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q1 financial results.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. As shown on slide seven, Q1 was another strong quarter of financial performance, with revenue growing 45% compared to Q1 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 83.5% in Q1, an increase of one percentage point versus the same quarter last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by improved production costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower realized prices.\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 26% as we invested in promotional activities to support new launches across our therapeutic areas. R and D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR and D charges of $1.57 billion, primarily related to the previously announced acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics' PI3K alpha inhibitor program. In total, IPR and D charges negatively impacted earnings per share by $1.72.\nOur non-GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R and D, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 42.6%, an increase of over 11 percentage points from Q1 2024. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20.2%. The Q1 tax rate was negatively impacted by the previously described non-deductible acquired IPR and D charges.\nAt the bottom line, we deliver earnings per share of $3.34 in Q1, inclusive of the negative impact of $1.72 from acquired IPR and D charges. This compares to earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1 2024, inclusive of $0.10 of acquired IPR and D charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. US revenue increased 49% in Q1, driven by strong volume growth of our key products, including Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by a 7% decline in price. Moving to Europe, revenue increased 71% in constant currency.\nQ1 2025 was positively impacted by a one-time benefit of $370 million related to further restructuring our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Excluding this benefit, constant currency revenue grew 46%, driven primarily by Mounjaro, partially offset by a 7% decline in price. Japan revenue grew 15% in constant currency, with volume growing 16%, driven by Mounjaro and Jardiance.\nMoving to China, Q1 revenue increased 21% in constant currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro. As a reminder, we recently initiated a limited Mounjaro launch in China with the expectation to gradually increase commercial launch in the second half of 2025 as supply becomes available. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 17% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and, to a lesser extent, Verzenio. Slide nine provides an update on the performance of our key products.\nBeginning with immunology, we have seen encouraging US uptake of Ebglyss in atopic dermatitis. New patient starts are increasing, and we are making good progress securing access and reimbursement. Ebglyss is currently covered by two of the largest pharmacy benefit managers, and we expect further access improvement later this year.\nAs of 1 May 2025, Ebglyss will be reimbursed on plans that account for 60% of people who are commercially insured. For Omvoh, we have received approval of Crohn's disease across the globe as a second indication. Commercial activities are going to drive new patient starts in this larger patient population. Moving to oncology, Jaypirca was recently approved in Europe for relapse or refractory CLL in patients who previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. We anticipate launches beginning in Q2.\nWe also expect readouts from additional global Phase III trials later this year, which we believe will be important to evaluate Jaypirca in earlier settings of CLL, including a head-to-head comparison with Ibrutinib. Verzenio global sales grew 10% in Q1, as Verzenio continues to be the standard of care in high-risk early breast cancer. As expected, we have seen some impact from competition in early breast cancer.\nHowever, Verzenio's share of market in high-risk early breast cancer is stable, and total prescription continues to grow. US prescription grew by 7% in Q1, partially offset by the wholesaler inventory destocking in the quarter. International volumes for Verzenio grew 30% in Q1. Within neuroscience, Kisunla is now approved in 12 countries.\nWe have seen a steady increase in the use of blood-based biomarkers, the conversion rate from diagnosis to treatment, and the number of new patients starting treatment in both the US and Japan. While it is encouraging to see progress, we do still expect that it will take some time to build this market. We expect US regulatory action for the modified dose enrichment for Kisunla in the next few months.\nFinally, moving to cardiometabolic health, both Mounjaro and Zepbound posted strong revenue growth. Mounjaro sales were $3.8 billion, more than double the same quarter last year. In the US, Mounjaro exited Q1 as the market leader in new prescriptions within diabetes incretin analogs. Outside the US, Mounjaro has launched in over 40 countries, and Q1 was another quarter of steady sequential growth. We recently launched in India and Mexico and plan to continue with additional countries throughout 2025.\nOur focus internationally is on seeking reimbursement for type two diabetes and developing the ecosystem to treat obesity as a chronic disease. Zepbound's performance was also robust, as sales increased by $1.8 to 2.3 billion in the quarter. Zepbound is the US-branded anti-obesity market leader in both total prescription and new prescription, reaching 60% and 74% respectively at the end of Q1.\nWe also launched higher-dose Zepbound vials adding two additional doses for patients to access Zepbound through the self-pay channel. The uptake of Zepbound vials has been strong, and vials accounted for approximately 10% of total prescription, and 25% of new prescriptions in Q1. On slide 10 is an update on trends in the US increasing analog market, which includes increasing prescriptions in both type two diabetes, and obesity. Q1 was another quarter of steady market growth, as total prescriptions grew by 46% compared to Q1 2024.\nLilly's performance was strong as a four-week rolling average share of market increased by five percentage points compared to Q4 2024 and by 10 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to slide 12 is our updated 2025 financial guidance. Our performance in Q1 was strong, and we are encouraged by the underlying trends we saw across our portfolio of medicines. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue and performance margin guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is unchanged except for Q1 charges related to acquired IPR and D.\nAs Dave mentioned, the situation regarding TERID and TAREF remains dynamic. We continue to monitor the external environment. However, we estimate that the announced tariff currently in effect will have a limited impact financially, which we have absorbed within our 2025 guide. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R and D.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Lucas. I'll start with key data from our recently completed Orforglipron Phase III trial and provide some context on our development plans and timelines for this important molecule. I've previously said that our hypothesis was that Orforglipron could deliver efficacy, safety, and tolerability similar to the best seen for available GLP-1 monotherapy injectables. I believe the results from ACHIEVE-1 trial support that hypothesis. Let me start with efficacy.\nBeginning on slide 13, you can see the reduction of 1.3 to 1.6% for Hemoglobin A1C. Given the relatively low baseline of 8.0 in this 40-week monotherapy study, patients on the two highest doses ended the study with a mean A1C of about 6.5%, similar to the lowest levels achieved in trials of other monotherapy GLP-1 agonists.\nIn fact, with Orforglipron, more than 65% of patients achieved an A1C less than or equal to 6.5%, which is below the American Diabetes Association's defined threshold for diabetes. In a key secondary endpoint, Orforglipron also helped people with diabetes lose approximately 16 pounds, or 7.9% of their body weight at the highest dose. These data are in line with weight loss demonstrated with existing injectable GLP-1s in patients with diabetes, especially when considering the baseline weight and other demographic factors in this trial.\nGiven that the study was only 40 weeks in duration, participants had not yet reached a weight plateau at the conclusion of this study. This result is encouraging as we look ahead to our first Phase III readout in people with obesity that we expect in Q3. Most importantly, we were pleased to see the safety profile of Orforglipron in this trial.\nThe most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with the GLP-1 class. We did not see any hepatic safety issues in ACHIEVE-1. As you can see on slide 14, discontinuations due to adverse events were low, with only 4% to 8% of patients discontinuing Orforglipron due to adverse events. The slow and stepwise dose escalation we utilized in Phase III, combined with the relatively long, about 24-hour half-life of this molecule, resulted in a tolerability profile that matched our expectations and was consistent with weekly injectable GLP-1s.\nThe ACHIEVE-1 full results will be presented at the ADA's 85th Scientific Sessions and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This was the first of several Phase III trials that read out for Orforglipron. On slide 15, you can see how ACHIEVE-1 fits into the broader Orforglipron development program.\nOver the next 12 months, we expect to get results from four additional diabetes trials where we're studying Orforglipron compared to insulin and head-to-head versus other oral diabetes medicines. We also expect to get results in our two obesity Phase III trials, one trial in people with obesity without diabetes, and a second trial in people with obesity and diabetes.\nAssuming success in these Phase III programs, we plan to submit Orforglipron for obesity in Q4 later this year, followed by type two diabetes in H1 2026. We also have an ongoing Phase III trial in obesity in the maintenance setting, a Phase III trial in obstructive sleep apnea and obesity, and we will initiate a Phase III trial in hypertension later this quarter.\nWe look forward to seeing more data from this robust clinical development program as we continue to define the impact Orforglipron can have for patients. Moving on to other R and D updates since our last call. On the regulatory front, following discussions with the FDA, we've withdrawn our US application for the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction indication for Tirzepatide. We believe the positive Phase III data from the summit trial do support an indication. However, FDA indicated an additional confirmatory clinical trial is required. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in other countries.\nContinuing with updates in cardiometabolic health, we're sharing today plans to initiate a new Phase III trial studying our triple agonist, Retatrutide, in patients with obesity and chronic low back pain. We're also announcing today next steps for our oral once-daily program targeting lipoprotein(a), Muvalaplin.\nIn Phase II data we presented last year, Muvalaplin lowered lipoprotein(a) levels by up to 85% at the highest tested dose. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase III program later this year in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and we're excited about the potential to bring what could be the first-ever oral small molecule approach for lowering lipoprotein(a) to patients. Moving to oncology, we've now started a new Phase III program with Olemuracib in KRAS G12C mutant resected adjuvant lung cancer.\nThis is the third potential indication that we're simultaneously pursuing for Olemuracib. Across our therapeutic areas, we made good progress in our early phase portfolio, and we advanced five new medicines into Phase I clinical trials, as shown on slide 16. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. We know uncertainties exist right now in trade tax and international relations. While Lilly is actively engaged in shaping the external environment, we're mostly focused on executing our winning strategy: discovering, developing, and making new medicines that can help people live healthier lives. We made good progress this quarter, and we are well positioned to deliver strong and sustained growth going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to moderate our Q and A session.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible. Consistent with prior quarters, we will respond to one question per caller, and we'll end the call promptly at 11:00AM. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q and A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants today limit themselves to one question. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we pull for questions. The first question today is coming from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs. Asad, your line is live.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, just in light of the CVS formulary announcement this morning favoring Wegovy over Zepbound, there are clearly some investor concerns about the PBM dynamic in obesity given what we've seen in other big healthcare markets in the past where PBMs pit two companies against each other.\nSo two-part question. Number one, what is your expectation on market share dynamics in the next weeks and months from the CVS formulary loss? And then second, can you talk to your strategy on how you're going to be navigating an environment where we could see PBMs continue to try and restrict formulary access between Zepbound and Wegovy? Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We're not surprised that this kind of thing was announced. If we look at what's happening in the market, we're pretty deep into a replacement cycle, particularly on obesity, and Tirzepatide, as we've highlighted on this call, is gaining a lot of market share, basically most of the growth in the category that's happening with our medicine.\nOf course, the private pay market is an important segment. We'd like to grow that segment, and we'd like to grow choice and access in that segment. So we're not interested at all in one-of-one deals of reducing access and choice for doctors and patients. We want to expand it. So this type of thing isn't too interesting to us, but it's understandable that it can happen, and obviously, in this one case, did. Our focus is on making better medicines and more accessible medicines.\nSo Orforglipron is a topic today, excited by the possibility of an oral that could be more widely distributed around the world and here in the US with injectable GLP-1-like profile, like Dan highlighted, and of course, on driving more advanced therapies as well in combination or triple-acting agents like Retatrutide. So that's our focus. It doesn't surprise me that this happened, and we'll work through it.\nRecognizing in this case as well, we're talking about the templated lives at CVS, and probably opt-in rates for employers in the templated part of their book are pretty low compared to the national average, just to maybe inform your analysis. And we'll work through it. Our job will be to continue to drive share and preference for our brand. I think the team's done a great job of that year to date, and we'll continue to focus on that while we wait for the Orforglipron launch and Retatrutide data later this year.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Asad. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Geoff, your line is live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citibank\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for the question. For Dan or for Dave, when you look at the positioning of Orforglipron, is the ultimate goal to have meaningfully more indications than Tirzepatide just given the oral convenience? I think when you look beyond just weight loss, it would seem that a broader cardio investment makes sense, but maybe also perhaps combos in INI, or autoimmune, or even neuropsych. Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Geoff. We'll go to Dan to talk about the oral development strategy.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Geoff. And I think you're correctly pointing out that an oral medicine like Orforglipron could be acceptable for use in a number of broad indications, particularly primary care type indications. That's guided our thinking on indications that we're pursuing. I think coming out of this readout, we have even more confidence in this molecule and will aggressively pursue whatever directions we think work. Combinations surely are on the table where that makes sense for patients, particularly in disease areas where there could be synergy with other mechanisms.\nProbably there are a number of good ideas in immunology and neuroscience, as you point out. Also, just a reminder, Geoff, it's not our only oral incretin. We have another molecule behind that, and we're continuing to innovate with even multifunctional orals. So I'm pretty excited about what's yet to come here. Surely we start with type two diabetes and obesity, but more to come.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. On from the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just another Orforglipron data. Just post the data we've seen here. Can you just elaborate a bit more on the role you see Orforglipron playing in the core obesity and diabetes market relative to injectables? And maybe as part of that, any thoughts on what type of share you would envision orals taking in the market over time? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Patrik to talk about that role of oral in the broader incretin market.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nHey, thanks a lot, Chris. I think there are significant opportunities here for Orforglipron. Just looking at the type two market today, we know that approximately 50% of patients have a preference for an oral, giving everything else equal on the efficacy and the safety side. And similarly, on the obesity side, we know that we have approximately 25% of the patients in the US suffering from needle fear. So I think that positions us very nicely to be a first-line incretin for both type two and chronic weight management.\nThere are other benefits as well. I think with an oral here, we can scale and reach patients that is more or less impossible with only injectables. So I think it provides a huge global opportunity for us with Orforglipron and also from a manufacturing side, probably a significant benefit as well. Overall, I think tremendous opportunities here with Orforglipron in type two and obesity in the US and other markets where we have launched, but also to scale globally to an extent we can't do with injectables.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe two quick adds there. Segments that we're thinking about actively. One, of course, we're doing the maintenance studies, which switch people from injectable to oral to maintain weight loss. That's a big unmet need in the market. People like the idea of stepping down and using less medicine. They're trying things on their own now, and we'll have a science-based solution using oral, which we think will be an attractive choice. That data is not in hand yet. We need to wait for that to prove that out.\nBut I think that that's an interesting segment that will probably grow quite large over time, Chris. The other one is reaching segments of the population that maybe have comorbid risk, maybe not comorbid disease, have overweight but not obesity, and don't need dramatic weight loss, but sustained lower body weight is an important factor in their long-term health.\nWe'll look at studies there. I think the prior question was alluding to that in terms of indications that might be suitable for that space. We have big ambitions here and, of course, need to see the full data package come in on obesity, but a pretty exciting opportunity.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Patrik. Thanks, Dave. Ready for the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Two-part on Orforglipron as well. I know you're obviously not going to comment directly on pricing at this point, but maybe just conceptually, if you're delivering the same profile as an injectable medicine, why would you decide to price lower, I guess, given your price to value? And then as you think about having a portfolio of weight loss medications potentially in 2026, does that give you additional leverage with some of these PBM discussions? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGoing on the risk curve again, Terence, with the two-part question, but go to Patrik to weigh in the thoughts on the Orforglipron pricing and then the portfolio implications as well.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWell, thanks a lot, Terence. I think in terms of pricing, we normally don't comment on that until the time of launch. But I think truly having a portfolio in this space, and as Dave shared earlier on oral, that you actually could approach patients with a BMI above 27, lower BMIs, Tirzepatide that probably will play as a foundation for treatment of chronic weight management for quite some time to come, and potentially a triple agonist where you could target people with a BMI above 35. And so I think that gives us a position of strength in this marketplace.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe just one policy-related add. How do we think about pricing forward, especially in a category like this? The past was really about very high list prices and relatively deep discounts to leverage PBM access. And we've been very vocal about trying to move away from that past, basically to have a more transparent, closer pricing between list and net.\nMaybe important to say that based on this morning's news as well. So we priced Zepbound at a discount to the competitor, a meaningful discount on list price, with the idea of trying to squeeze those two numbers together. We'd like to continue that progress so that patients and payers have a more similar basis for cost-sharing and net cost. I think that's a better way forward.\nSo just as Patrik and the team work on pricing strategies, etc., know that in the background, we're trying to push these two numbers together over time, reduce gross to net spreads, have less rebate flow into the channel, and more transparent overall pricing.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Patrik. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I think going back to the CVS announcement this morning, there are two ways to look at it. I mean, one could be, which obviously the stock reaction is like that. It seems like, I mean, a Zepbound versus Wegovy kind of price war. Or the other way could be, I mean, looking at CVS comments, it seems like a lot of employers did not opt in, and CVS is finding a way to actually provide affordable access to this medicine. How do you view this development? And in longer term, I think, is it a better versus GLP-1s you see, or is it a GLP-1 versus the AXA situation you see this is going to evolve over a couple of years?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Mohit. I think, Dave, do you want to elaborate on some of the earlier comments about the PDS range?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, definitely. I mean, I think those are good questions to ask Novo and CVS, really. Just pointing out that the book of business we're talking about is smaller employers who tend to take the templated formulary. The opt-in rates already are low. So it is possible that, depending on what net price that CVS is going to offer this client, so you get more opt-in. I think that's a net good thing overall because what we see, despite the press, is when employers opt in, they tend to not opt out.\nEmployees like to be on these medicines. And there was a big study yesterday you may have seen from Aon, which looked at real-world data, which is very compelling that within two years, there's ROI and a 40% reduction in MACE events in the real world, etc. So that could be good, as you're saying.\nOn the other hand, I guess we're focused on innovation and differentiation. We see kind of a mega category here that will have many different choices and solutions. It seems like the wrong idea to reduce choice. Maybe there's patients who are taking Zepbound in one of these formularies, and as of 1 July 2025, they won't have that choice. I think they'll be quite upset about that. We'll see how the market reacts and how much share gets moved ultimately. As I said, our preference is to expand access, not reduce it.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will be from Alex Hammond from Wolfe. Alex, your line is live.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Head of Therapeutics Research, Wolfe\n\nThanks for taking the question. Just one quick one on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3. So during the Q4 call, Dan mentioned that the team is closely watching the clinical trial, and the study will read out when the target number of progression events were accrued. Can you update us as to where we are from that event's point of view and remind us of what a successful trial looks like? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Alex. We'll go to Anne for the question on the welcome question on the Alzheimer's portfolio.\n\nAnne White\n\nPresident of Lilly Neuroscience, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYes. Thanks so much for your question on Alzheimer's. As we mentioned in the past, we have completed enrollment in the TB3 study. As you said, it's an event-based study. The timeline for the readout is driven by this. Although our ClinicalTrials.gov lists the date in 2027, we believe it could be earlier than that. We're looking forward to that. Now, these are patients who have elevated levels of amyloid but no detectable symptoms.\nOur goal is to significantly reduce the risk that people ever experience the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. That's the goal of the study. The actual endpoint is time to event of clinical progression. We measure that by the CDR Global Score. Really preventing people from moving to the symptomatic stage, which is the stage at which the greatest impact is happening.\nSo what we saw in TB2, obviously, got us very excited about the potential outcome here with the fact that patients earliest in the disease, and early symptomatic, did so well and had such a significant slowing of progression, 60%. So we'll look forward to sharing more as the events occur. And again, we'll share more timing when we have those events reached.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Anne. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThanks for the question. So I'll go with another non-obesity question. How is Ebglyss tracking against your ambition of it being a best-in-class launch? Is your vision for peak sales in line with consensus sales of $2 billion, or do you see an opportunity materially higher than that? And if not, is the barrier related to Sanofi's claimed rebate wall or something else like the breadth of the label or perceived efficacy differentiation? Thanks so much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan to talk about the Ebglyss launch dynamics and some goals for the brand.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Seamus. We certainly do have high aspirations for Ebglyss. It's a great medicine. We saw amazing data in our clinical trials. I think this prepared us well to take on the market leader in atopic derm, which is a large and growing market. In the early months of launch, we've seen good uptake, as you can see reflected in the numbers. I think probably most telling is what we're seeing and hearing from physicians.\nInitially, I think in any launch, people tried in their most severe patients, people who might have failed other therapies, and when they see good responses there, they move it into the first-line setting. That's exactly the motion we're seeing from physicians. They're happy with the results they're getting, and they're using it more and more.\nA lot of work to do, and you point out the heavy competitive dynamics, but I like the asset I have. In terms of the rebates and coverage, I think as Lucas said, we're seeing a growing coverage here in the United States, and I think we'll overcome any issues there without trouble. So we look forward to broad access and continued accelerating uptake.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Question on kind of going back to formulary positioning in obesity. So I know you don't want to play the one-of-one formulary game, but it's still something that might occur anyway because Novo's losing share to you, and price is really the only lever they can pull at the moment. And some payers will look at one-of-one as a way to manage spend. I know that some states have already taken that approach.\nNow we're seeing CVS do it. So really the question is, I guess, of covered lives today, what percent of payers already are having this one-of-one approach? And just, again, your view for how this is going to evolve going forward, whether you like it or not.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tim. For the next question on CVS, we'll go to Patrik.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thank you very much, Tim. One-of-one is quite rare in the marketplace today when it comes to obesity. And as Dave said earlier, we deal with contract negotiations all the time, and we are not entirely surprised with the announcement this morning taking into account Zepbound's strong performance. For us, we will just continue to execute as strongly as we can. And I think we have a tremendous momentum in the marketplace with a net switch that is quite significant to Zepbound in the marketplace. We will continue those efforts across the PBMs, Medicaid, and also Medicare, and of course, our self-pay effort with buyouts as well.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Patrik. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on Tirzepatide and HFpEF. The update was a bit surprising today. Can you provide some additional detail on what FDA wants to see in regard to additional data, and what you didn't have from the SURMOUNT trial that was to demonstrate the clear enough benefit? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Evan. We'll go to Dan for the question on the heart failure dynamics.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Evan. It's probably obvious to you as it is to us that that was a study with a really strong and profound benefit for patients. So we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with that. I think from the FDA perspective, they want multiple trials to support this indication. I think that's probably where we ended it. It's possible we could get additional data from other trials to support a resubmission here.\nOn the other hand, just remember that all of the patients in this trial and in the proposed indication are already covered under the obesity indication. It's not a new population to treat. It's rather a new benefit for people that might already be widely understood to doctors today.\nSo it's a bit unfortunate we're in this position, and it could have a bit of a curtailing effect on investment in HFpEF, which is a pretty serious unmet medical need. So I'm sorry to see that, but it's kind of hard to think of the incentive for doing large outcome trials in this population that's already covered under an existing indication and the benefits are well understood.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thank you for the question. Maybe one for Lucas. I know revenue guidance was maintained, but is the mid to high single-digit price headwind still intact following the CVS formulary decision on Zepbound and also given the movement in FX? Thank you.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question, James. Maybe just jumping into it right away. As you've heard, we are reaffirming our guide for the full year that the midpoint continues to be in that 32% range for the year. We are off to a good start with the strong growth that we've seen in Q1. To your question about the price, yes, again, I mentioned last time, and I'm reaffirming now again that mid- to high-single-digit price erosion. We've seen that in Q1, by the way, -6% in price. So it's very consistent with what I shared in the last earnings call. So overall, I think that perspective has not changed both in terms of the guide and our expectations on price for the year.\nMaybe just again to provide a little bit more perspective on how things evolve and how we think about the guide. There are always dynamics taking place during the year, as you can imagine. We factor those ones as part of our forecasting process. As Patrik alluded, we are not surprised with this. Again, we will continue to navigate. We feel strongly about the uptake that we are seeing nowadays, and we will continue to navigate through this throughout the year.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Lucas. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is live.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on recent Orforglipron updates. I had a question, or a two-part question on Orforglipron safety. First, I recall you mentioned no hepatic safety signal was observed in no highs law. Could you confirm there was no numerical imbalance on ALT above five times? And on diarrhea, I recall it was in the low to mid-20s across the second-highest and highest dose. How should we think about that heading into the obesity trial, especially with longer duration? Thank you very much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks so much for the question on the safety profile for Orforglipron.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Thanks. Those are very specific questions, which I may not precisely know the answer to, honestly. But as far as the overall liver safety profile, including kind of mean changes and excursions from the mean, we didn't see anything of concern here, and it looked very similar to placebo. So I think we feel confident.\nAdditional data readouts coming, of course, but so far so good. I think with respect to rates of diarrhea, you're pointing out that they were a bit higher in this study than we've seen in previous studies. They were also higher in the placebo rate. I think we might need to move to an understanding of diarrhea rates as a sort of a ratio of drug to placebo because they can be pretty variable depending on the country that you enroll the trial.\nWe saw that effect in this study with some countries having very high diarrhea rates in placebo and drug, and also the way that's ascertained by the investigator. I didn't see anything of concern there, but I do know our trials probably across the least seem to have slightly higher diarrhea rates than others. Let's see what we see in the obesity rate. That's not the main focus here. Probably the more telling indicator of tolerability is going to be discontinuations due to adverse events. That's what probably matters the most in the real world.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. My recollection is that Lilly used aggressive formulary positioning as a lever with Taltz against other IL-17 competitors and therefore reduced choice. Would you refresh our memories on what that did for Taltz in terms of share and incremental sales, and if you're willing to, at what discount? How can that experience inform us on the outlook for Zepbound and Wegovy on the CVS formulary? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. Dave, we'll go to you for the history on biomeds.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. So four score and seven years ago. We launched Taltz almost a decade ago. I have a different regulator. I was in charge of it at the time. Actually, we had a situation where we were the follower. What we tried to do is go from one-of-one in a new category to two of two. That's what I think we more or less achieved over the course of the first three or four years of the brand. Of course, things have changed since then with IL-23s and now a third IL-17 entering, and you do see one-of-ones.\nBut I guess maybe a point to raise here is that kind of payer behavior is more common in the pharma industry when you have more than two players and when you have product profiles that are clinically kind of close to each other. Just pointing out in the obesity space, neither of those things are true. And it'll be interesting to see how this experiment works. We have more differentiation coming.\nSo I think there'll be more choice needed in the marketplace, not less. It's really never been our strategy in a category to use the payer channel to drive share exclusively. Even when we had big advantages on clinical profile. I mean, Jardiance is an example of that where we always sought to have multiple choices in that class. So different memory than yours, Steve, although you've been doing this a long time as well.\nAnd that doesn't mean we didn't have some situations that were one-of-one for Taltz, but it wasn't our preferred position. And frequently, we didn't offer different rates to get there. So all that's true now. We, as a company position, want more choice. And particularly where innovation's flourishing and we have a lot of it coming, it wouldn't be in our interest.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is coming from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for the question. Perhaps just following on from Steve's question as well. Can you clarify for us? Because I think a number of investors are concerned, and obviously, we see that in the share price today. How many current patients on Zepbound are being covered by CVS Caremark today?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Courtney. Maybe give some color on the rough magnitude, Patrik, on the CVS Zepbound formulary dynamics?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. I don't have a specific number of lives to share today. But I think when you look at it, at least so back to it, it's not the entire CVS account. We're talking about a subset of plans that they shared earlier. We also need to understand what is the level of employer opt-in in those plans. We believe it's not on the high end. So I think that's probably the guidance we can provide today. We will just continue our efforts to drive increased employer opt-in across other plans and segments. But that's the number. That's the only thing I can share today.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Patrik. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David, your line is live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks very much. So I'm hoping that you can comment, Dave, on discussions with the Trump administration on tariffs outside of the 232 investigation. So the driver of my question is that the countries of origin for Lilly's drugs' IP and API are obviously not in countries that represent national security threats. And I'm curious about the discussions to satisfy the Trump administration's interests in having drug companies record more profits in the United States and generate more tax revenue in the United States. Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dave. Dave, go ahead. [Inaudible]\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company",
    "content2": "No, burning question. I mean, you're correct in pointing out that the Section 232 mechanism is a national security mechanism, and that's where the pharma review sits today. Separately, there's an agenda item in the administration to repatriate supply chain, and one we support. And then thirdly, there's a question of raising revenue while they're going through a reconciliation process and so forth.\nSo just on those three things, the 232 review, I think, has merit in the sense that if we look at what are really a lot of commonly used generic medications, some of which invented by Lilly long ago or other innovative companies, have moved toward offshore sources, single-source sources, and potentially in competing countries where you could imagine a future conflict and a potential problem. We see that too. I think the branded industry would like to help with that problem if we could.\nFundamentally, it's kind of a market mechanism problem where there's no real good pricing available. So there's not going to be an onshore presence until there is. But in the case of emergency, maybe we could work with them. I think there's a big question of whether tariffing that would do anything to move the supply chain. And maybe that's the subject of that review. And we would hope the 232 review would be the kind of key to that question. Secondly, is the trade imbalance broader thing? And as you're pointing out, we sort of have a mixed sourcing, US and non-US, but most of our non-US is Irish origin. And we're in the process.\nWe made a decision four years ago with the board to move away from just a pure efficiency, whether it be tax efficiency or cost of goods efficiency, and move to more of a resilient position. We've been at this a little while, and we'll continue to do that. And so that will rebalance naturally our sourcing. We'll have more choices. So I think tariffing that could have a transient effect for Lilly, but probably not a long-term one. We think the real answer there, as I said earlier, is to reduce the gap that led to that problem in the beginning, which is really an income tax situation. And when the US was at 35, and Ireland was at whatever, 15.\nSo I think tax reform is key to that, and we'll fix that problem for the long term. Within Lilly, we've made investments to sort of contain that anyway. The raising revenue in general is a separate point. One that we point out that our industry pays a disproportionate amount of income tax. Actually, because in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there are provisions for a minimum global tax, basically, so that we already pay tax on foreign-sourced income. So that really doesn't change whether we move it back to the US or not.\nWhat that does is it has an effect of raising income tax in these third countries, which it actually has done over the last seven years. So I think we're well-positioned within the mix of companies. I think these issues are complicated and hard to reduce to sound bites. 232 has substance. I think the trend for the industry and certainly for Lilly of redomesticating is well underway. We hope we don't have to get into a tariff discussion. Hopefully, we pass a tax bill, and this can normalize.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live. Kerry, please check your mute button. Your line is live.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nApologies. Thank you. A question on the cash pay approach here in the US is Zepbound. CVS also announced that its pharmacists will stock the Wegovy cash pay pens. So my question is whether Zepbound's cash pay vials are available in the US in any pharmacy chain today. And given your enthusiasm for that opportunity, cash pay in general, I'm interested in whether you're considering additional channels outside your online Lilly Direct portal.\nWould that be an opportunity for you as well within the pharmacy chain in the US? And then a related question, do you ultimately intend to ever offer the Zepbound pens via the cash pay route, or do you intend to keep that separation? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Kerry. Related question again, getting close to the line there. But Patrik, do you want to take the question on the vials, the cash pay distribution, and if we would ever think of other formulations?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. I think we're very pleased with the performance in our self-pay segment. And if we look just on Q1, the revenues above $200 million and 25% of the MBRX for Zepbound are initiated in Q1 through self-pay, and 17% of the entire market MBRX in self-pay. And I think we stated from the beginning when we launched Lilly Direct that we did need to remove friction for patients and that we would continue to add products, add services, and other components. So I think you should expect more to come through Lilly Direct.\nI don't have anything to announce today, but I would just emphasize that the price change that we announced earlier this year and the launch of high-dose vials has significantly contributed to an even further acceleration of the market growth. So I think we are doing something here to really enable more patients to access those medications at a relatively competitive price.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Patrik. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. It seems like your team's really going after the 75% of Americans who are both overweight and obese. Would long-term net pricing have to approach insulin levels for that to become reality? Additionally, the street models long-term margins going above 50%, while your team's been insistent that that 40% to 45% range is really sustainable. How much of that delta is really us misunderstanding your volume over price approach to GLP-1s long-term?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Akash. We'll go to Patrik and then potentially Lucas to talk about both pricing long-term and margins.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nI would say when we look at the overall portfolio, I think we have stated from the beginning that we will continue to take a very disciplined approach here. But also, what Dave shared, we probably see an evolution here where you see a delta in between this price and net price of patients. I think that's pretty much what's guiding us from a portfolio perspective moving forward.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. I already comment from the pricing perspective. I think the pricing pressures are consistent with the trends that we have seen in the last 12 months. That's what we are forecasting moving forward. It's a very dynamic situation as well, but we remain disciplined on our approach to provide optionality and have an open access for patients, so.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Lucas. Thank you, Patrik. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for the question. Just on ortho obesity expectations. So in a similar way to outlining your thoughts on the ortho diabetes achieve data, how are you thinking about the weight loss for ortho in the attain obesity studies? And on the tolerability side of things, can you just give us any color on when you had those GI side effects and discontinuations in achieve? Was it early or later? Just thinking about how tolerability could be from the attain versus achieve studies. Thanks.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Trung. We'll go to Dan for the ortho questions.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks. These are important questions, particularly the expectations for the obesity study. It probably takes some pain again to remind people that this is a monotherapy GLP-1 agonist, not a dual agonist like Tirzepatide. So we need to expect weight loss that can be seen with GLP-1 monotherapy, which, as we showed in SURMOUNT 5, is quite different than what you get with two actions that Tirzepatide has. So SURMOUNT 5 was a 72-week trial in obesity patients that Lilly ran that included monotherapy GLP-1 injectable in the form of semaglutide up to 2.4 milligrams.\nI think in that study, we achieved about 13.7% weight loss with the GLP-1 monotherapy. This is a similar trial. It's not exactly the same for Orforglipron, but probably we should expect to be somewhere near that. I think on tolerability, that study also had about 20% of the patients, maybe 21% of the patients, with vomiting, which is probably the most reliable indicator of GI tolerability and the most consistent across trials.\nSo that's our expectations. Again, it's still to match the best available data from an injectable. In this case, I've focused on the trial that we conducted since we're conducting this trial with Orforglipron. With respect to when did the discontinuations and tolerability events occur in the previous study, I think it was pretty similar to what we've seen in the past with injectables that usually these things happen early in the study when people increase their dose.\nActually, some of the difference between the top two doses was probably just a chance because it happened pretty early in the study when actually patients would have been on the same dose level during the escalation scheme. So nothing of concern there. I think if we'd seen a different pattern with events happening late in the study, I think that would be more concerning, but that is not what we saw.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. We're going to try to do a couple more quick ones. So next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Carter Gould from Cantor. Carter, your line is live.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cantor\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the upfront commentary on tariffs. I guess, Dave, given sort of your unique perspective in Lilly's active role in shaping policy, it's somewhat surprising we didn't hear you talk about some of the drug pricing risk. I guess anything you can share there around if you think potential MFN legislation is a priority or possibility in the coming balance of the year? Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Well, I think it's always a risk for the industry. I think we point out that it's not coherent to have a discussion about that without talking about real net pricing versus real pricing in Europe. And that pulls you into a PBM reform discussion and a 340B discussion. So it's a complicated matter. I think you have to ask what would be the vehicle for such a thing. And there's certainly appetite in both parties to pursue this. Our goal, by the way, long-term is to make sure that we can have a discussion, as I mentioned earlier, a trade with Europe that would really change how drugs are priced in that continent and developed economies pay more for the R and D costs. That's the real answer here.\nBut I think right now, we're hyper-focused as an industry on fixing the IRA problem that was created as to small molecules. I think our enthusiasm for that policy change is high. And that'll be the focus on the bill that's being contemplated now in May to get out of the house. So that's the focus today. And we'll try to manage the risk you're talking about in the background all the while, pointing out that it can't be independently looked at as list price in the US versus Europe. It's a nonsensical idea.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'll try to squeeze in one or two more.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Rajesh Kumar from HSBC. Rajesh, your line is live.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nEquity Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi there. Thanks for taking my question. Just on access and coverage of Zepbound, could you update us on how that looks now compared to, say, a year back, same time? How many more patients have coverage in the US? And what are the next steps, especially in light of compounders being blocked from selling competing products which are no longer allowed for Lilly's products at the moment?\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWe'll go to Patrik for an update on Zepbound access progress.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks very much. You know what? I think we shared earlier that the formulary access is probably the easiest step, and the more challenging step is going to get employers to opt in. We have made some significant progress back in 2024. We started the year with approximately 50% of the employers opting in. By the end of 2024, we were at mid- to high 50s. So progress there on employer opt-in. But also in other segments, in Medicaid, we have actually moved from 11 states being covered by the end of 2024 to 14 states covering now, and incremental states in Medicaid that have opted in in April, specifically for OSA.\nOn OSA, we know that the CMS has issued guidance that plans can reimburse for OSA, but they have 180 days since the approval, which took place late December last year, to expect some progress in Medicaid as well during the second half of this year. In terms of compounding, I think it's really hard to assess the magnitude of that market. But I think a couple of important cuts here. Not all of those patients are necessarily on label. And B, there is also a matter of pricing.\nWe believe that our price point of $349 is actually quite competitive. And thirdly, in terms of the overall preference in the marketplace, where we currently have a strong momentum with more than 75% of patients starting anti-obesity treatment starting on Zepbound. I think we'll continue to execute along those lines across those segments, and we see progress being made every week.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Patrik. And then last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nLast question today will be from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Kripa, your line is live.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nBiotech Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I have a question about the Bimagrumab Phase II trial, which is expected to be completed by June. Any update on when we might see data? We've heard the potential to see data in June at a conference. Also, can you help set expectations for the data? Thank you so much.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kripa. We'll go to Dan to talk about the bimagrumab.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question on the Bimagrumab. There are actually two Phase II trials. The first one that was conducted actually before we acquired the asset was in combination with semaglutide. That'll be the data that'll be disclosed first. The ongoing trial is in combination with Tirzepatide. And of course, that's the trial of greater interest to us. And I don't think we've commented on when we might disclose that data. Remember that this is an agent that was designed to see if we could have a positive effect on lean mass as well as a decrease in fat mass. And so that's what we're trying to see how that works in combination with these GLP-1s.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave, for closing comments. Okay, great. Thank you all for participating today on our earnings call and your interest in the company. Please follow up with the IR team as you have questions, which I'm sure you will after today. Everyone have a great day. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Should you request assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike, please go ahead.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly US.A. We're also joined by Mark Keeman, Wes Tall, and Wai Wong of the Investor Relations team. During the call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide four.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Mike. 2024 was a productive year for Lilly. We grew our top line, advanced our pipeline, and invested in our supply chain to meet the increasing demand for our medicines. Most importantly, we delivered for patients by bringing life-changing medicines to more people around the world. In 2024, full-year revenue grew 32% compared to 2023, exceeding our first-time guidance by $4 billion. Revenue grew 45% in the most recent quarter as our recently launched products gained momentum. Last year, we announced positive phase III results for imlunestrant, insulin efsitora alfa, and three additional tirzepatide trials. We also started phase III programs for lepodisiran, remternetug, and olomorasib based on positive earlier phase data.\nWe continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. We acquired Morphic Therapeutic and announced a collaboration with OpenAI to invent novel antimicrobials. We opened the Lilly C4 Innovation Center in Boston as a hub for Lilly's genetic medicines efforts and announced the new Lilly Gateway Lab in the UK to collaborate with European research. We advanced our manufacturing agenda, announcing investments to expand our footprint in Indiana, in Wisconsin, and in Ireland. Since 2020, our commitments to build, expand, and acquire manufacturing facilities now total more than $23 billion. Importantly, we brought innovative new medicines to patients.\nIn 2024, we received regulatory approvals for Kisunla, Ebglyss, and a new indication for Zepbound in OSA. This progress strengthens our portfolio of new products and enhances our capacity to drive top-tier growth and margin expansion. As you can see on slide five, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 45% and our new products growing by more than $3.1 billion, led by a strong uptake of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Q4 also saw solid performance across oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Our business excluding incretins grew by 20% in the quarter compared to Q4 2023, excluding the one-time benefits of business development.\nSince our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones. We received approval for our new indication of Zepbound and Omvoh. We submitted imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer and tirzepatide for heart failure. We also announced positive Phase 3 results in the SURMOUNT-5 study, where Zepbound demonstrated a 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy. We strengthened our overall supply position and delivered on our production target to make 1.5 times the saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. With more patients using Lilly Direct, the uptake of single-use Zepbound vials increased.\nWe had no wholesaler backorders as we closed 2024, and wholesalers have been fulfilling orders from pharmacies at very high levels. We continue to augment our internal pipeline with external innovation, announcing plans to acquire Scorpion Therapeutics' mutant-selective PI3Ka inhibitor program. This transaction will add a clinical-stage breast cancer asset to our oncology pipeline. Lastly, we returned $3 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition to that, we announced at the end of the year a $15 billion share repurchase program and the seventh consecutive 15% increase in our quarterly dividend. On slide six, you'll see a full list of key events since our Q3 call, including the milestones I mentioned here and several other updates.\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q4 and 2024 full-year results and provide details on the 2025 guidance.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide seven summarizes our financial performance in the fourth quarter, and slide eight for the full year. As Dave mentioned, our revenue grew 45% in Q4, primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Performance of our non-incretin portfolio was also strong as revenue grew 20%, excluding one-time payments related to business development. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 83.2% in Q4, primarily impacted by favorable product mix. R&D expenses increased 18% from continued investment in our early and late-stage portfolio.\nIn total, we started eight new Phase three programs in 2024 and advanced several new assets into the clinic. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 26%, mainly driven by promotional efforts to support ongoing and future launches. This includes US direct-to-consumer ads on Zepbound and Mounjaro, and US launch activities for Kisunla and Ebglyss. We also increased our commercial investment outside the US to support international launches of Mounjaro. Operating income more than doubled, increasing to $5.6 billion, driven by higher revenue from new products. The effective tax rate was 13.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $5.32, inclusive of $0.19 of acquired IP R&D charges.\nThis compares to $2.49 in Q4 2023 that includes $0.62 of acquired IP R&D. On slide nine, we quantified the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. US revenue increased 40% in Q4, driven by robust volume growth of 45%. Zepbound and Mounjaro were again the largest growth contributors, partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices decreased 5% in the US due to favorable changes to estimate for rebates and discounts related to Mounjaro in Q4 2023. Europe revenue grew 82% in constant currency.\nWe continue to be pleased with the uptake of Mounjaro and have now launched in all major European markets. In addition to growth from Mounjaro, European revenue benefited from one-time payment associated with the amendment of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. This was recorded in Jardiance revenue in Q4. Excluding this one-time payment, Europe revenue grew 61%. Japan revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Mounjaro, Omvoh, Jardiance, and Verzenio. In China, revenue increased 13% in constant currency. Trulicity and Verzenio drove volume growth. Mounjaro was recently made available in China and will proceed with a limited launch as supply becomes available.\nWe expect modest initial Mounjaro sales in China due to supply limitations, a more meaningful contribution in the second half of 2025. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 46% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide 10 provides an update on our performance of new and growth products. New products more than doubled in Q4 to $5.6 billion, led by global Mounjaro sales of $3.5 billion and US Zepbound sales of $1.9 billion. US Zepbound performance is going very well. We began promotional activities this quarter, and we continue to see strong uptake.\nIn Q4, Zepbound became the market leader in the anti-obesity market as measured by new prescriptions. As shown on slide 11, the combined US incretin analog market grew 45% compared to Q4 2023. We increased 3 percentage points in share of market in Q4 2024. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $114 million, adding another solid quarter of sequential revenue growth. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $57 million. With the recent FDA approval in Crohn's disease, we look to drive broader use in an additional patient population.\nThe Kisunla launch is progressing well, and prescriptions in the US have been steadily increasing. While it is early, we saw positive momentum across key indicators, including volume of diagnostic ordered, access in priority integrated health systems, coverage by Medicare and commercial plans, and number of infusion sites placing orders. We are encouraged by the launch of Ebglyss in the US. We saw early positive receptivity and high levels of physician engagement. In addition, we expect commercial access with two of the largest pharma benefit managers beginning in March. We now plan an accelerating investment in commercial activities to drive new patient start. Growth products also performed well as revenue increased by 13% compared to Q4 2023. Verzenio's growth trajectory continued as US total prescription grew by 15%.\nIn addition to strong execution in the early breast cancer indication, Verzenio revenue benefited from increased US wholesaler stock at year-end. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 25%, driven by Mounjaro switches and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to slide 13 and 14, I will discuss our 2025 financial guidance. As previously shared, we expect 2025 revenue to be between $58 and $61 billion. The midpoint represents approximately 32% growth compared to 2024. We anticipate continued US incretin class growth, consistent with the trajectory of total prescriptions seen in 2024.\nWe expect to launch Mounjaro in new markets outside the US and Europe throughout the year. Mounjaro international revenue will contribute to overall performance more significantly in the second part of 2025. Given the uptake of newer incretins, we expect Trulicity volume to continue declining as fewer new patients are starting on Trulicity. We expect oncology, neuroscience, and immunology to also grow revenue in 2025 as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Kisunla launch uptakes continue. At the portfolio level, we anticipate foreign exchange to be a headwind as the dollar has strengthened relative to other currencies. In addition, we forecast overall net prices to decline by mid- to high-single digits%, including US Part D changes.\nWe continue expanding our manufacturing capacity and estimate to produce 1.6 times the amount of incretin sellable doses during first half of 2025 compared to first half 2024. Our facility in Concord is anticipated to begin shipping medicines this year, and we plan to make continued progress on expanding our manufacturing network. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue is expected to be between 41.5% and 43.5%. At the midpoint, this reflects approximately 340 basis points of margin expansion compared to 2024. In SG&A, we will continue to invest behind our new launches, including direct-to-consumer efforts in the US to drive new patient activation. In addition, we plan to increase investment outside the US to support the launches of Mounjaro in new and existing markets.\nIn R&D, we plan to accelerate our investment in early and late-phase activities. As Dan will share later, we started eight phase III programs in 2024 and anticipate that investment in those programs will ramp as the studies enroll patients. We also plan to initiate phase III programs in 2025. While we keep a high bar for what we advance into clinical development, we expect to scale our investment in R&D this year. Other expenses are expected to be $600 to $700 million driven by interest expense. We estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 16%.\nEarnings per share, or EPS, is expected to be $22.50 and $24 on a non-GAAP basis. This doesn't include a forecast for charges related to IP R&D. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D and to provide an overview of potential key events we expect in 2025.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Lucas. Lilly & R&D had another productive quarter. I'll cover pipeline progress in Q4, then the 2024 key events, and finally provide potential key events for 2025. Since our last earnings call, two new indications were approved in the US: Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and Omvoh for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Both approvals are important milestones and mark an expansion in the number of patients who can benefit from each of these medicines. Moving to regulatory submissions, we completed submissions in the US and EU for tirzepatide for heart failure, and global submissions for imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer, and for Jaypirca with the BRUIN CLL-321 data.\nI'm also pleased to share that we've submitted an update to the Kisunla US label to include the dosing modification data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, and the FDA has granted the submission a priority review. In our Phase three portfolio, we initiated a new program for orfoglipron in obstructive sleep apnea. This program includes two studies under the same master protocol to evaluate if people with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity can benefit from orfoglipron. After Zepbound was approved in the US as the first and only prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea, we're excited to explore if an oral GLP-1 can also deliver a benefit in this disease. Earlier in the pipeline, we advanced a second oral GLP-1 into phase 2 in obesity and advanced eltrekibart into phase 2 for ulcerative colitis. Three phase 2 assets and phase 1 asset have been discontinued based on clinical readouts.\nIn Q4, we also beganphase 1 studies for four new molecules, one in each of our therapeutic areas. Q4 capped off a productive year of advancing new medicines at Lilly. In total, over the year, we started eight phase III programs. We phase III data from 21 trials, including 17 major publications in top-tier medical journals. We received regulatory approvals for two new medicines, Ebglyss and Kisunla, as well as many new indications around the world. We added 14 new programs to the early phase pipeline.\nOn slide 16, we detail these outcomes for our 2024 milestones. I'm pleased that nearly all of our anticipated milestones came to fruition positively in 2024. Turning our focus to 2025, slide 17 shows key R&D milestones we expect this year. Starting with our late-stage portfolio, we expect to initiate two new phase III programs this year. First, in oncology, we'll begin an adjuvant non-small cell lung phase III program for our KRAS G12C inhibitor, olomorasib, building on its ability to be administered with immunotherapy. Our current metastatic program is progressing well, and we've aligned with the FDA on phase III dose through the Project Optimus pathway. We shared a clinical update at the World Conference on Lung Cancer last fall, and we are encouraged by the ability to safely combine Olomorasib with other agents.\nphase III program will focus on moving to an earlier setting and combining with existing approved agents in both resectable and unresectable KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer to prevent cancer from recurring. The second program is in cardiometabolic health, where we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial for orfoglipron in hypertension, adding to the ongoing trials in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. I'm excited that this year we're looking forward to reading out multiple orfoglipron trials. We expect to see data from up to five studies in type 2 diabetes and two studies in obesity. Our goal is to generate efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile that is similar to that of an injectable single-acting GLP-1, but through an orally available medicine. The first Orfoglipron phase III trial to read out will be Achieve One, which is a 40-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nThese patients have a baseline Hemoglobin A1c between 7% and 9.5% and a body mass index of 23 or greater. The trial utilizes six escalating doses in four-week increments to a maximum dose of 36mg. Based on prior studies of Orfoglipron, as well as other GLP-1 therapies, we expect weight loss in people with diabetes to be significantly less than in people living with obesity who do not have diabetes. We anticipate ACHIEVE-1 will read out in Q2 this year, followed by up to four additional type 2 diabetes trials in second half of 2025, and a potential submission for this indication in 2026. The orforglipron phase III trials in people with obesity, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, are expected to read out in Q3 of this year. These trials will form the basis of our first orforglipron regulatory submissions, which will be for the treatment of obesity, and we expect to occur late in 2025.\nThis year, we also expect data from the tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT. Of course, this is an event-based trial, and the timeline is dependent on the accrual of cardiovascular events. We anticipate data in Q3. While designed to measure both non-inferiority and superiority compared to Trulicity, a positive outcome in either would demonstrate that tirzepatide reduces the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and would support a labeled indication. Late this year, we expect to see the first data from a triple-acting incretin, retatrutide, which combines GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. We believe this potential new medicine can deliver even more weight loss than tirzepatide and could potentially provide additional health benefits.\nThe initial study to read out, TRIUMPH-4, is a 68-week study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees who have a body mass index of 27 or greater. We'll also see multiple additional Jaypirca data sets this year. Physician feedback is very positive on experience with Jaypirca in the currently approved indications, and we hope that generating data in earlier lines of therapy will enable broader use within CLL and MCL. We could see data from additional trials in the first line or BTK naive settings this year. Moving to neurodegeneration, while we don't have a key event listed in 2025 for donanemab, we're closely watching the preclinical Alzheimer's disease study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3. This trial screened patients with a blood-based diagnostic and utilized a fixed duration of treatment with donanemab. By moving earlier in disease progression, the goal is to reduce the risks of developing any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\nWhile the current primary completion is projected for 2027, the study will read out when the target number of progression events are accrued. A new focus area for us in 2025 will be to study potential new applications of incretin biology across diseases in neuroscience and immunology. With a pipeline of incretins in clinical development and deep scientific expertise in this space, Lilly is well positioned to match the biologic properties of specific molecules to the desired indications being studied. We plan to start several clinical trials assessing potential benefits of our incretins in areas that could include brain health, substance use disorder, pain, neuropsychiatry, and inflammation. We'll be prepared to move rapidly into phase III trials based on clinical data and where our conviction is high. Lastly, we expect a number of important regulatory submissions in 2025, including orfoglipron for obesity, as I detailed, insulin efsitora alfa for type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide for cardiovascular outcomes, and multiple potential data sets for Jaypirca.\n2025 will be another exciting year for Lilly R&D. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Dan. So we had a strong financial performance in Q4 and throughout 2024. We finished $4 billion above our first-time revenue guide and $4 per share above our first-time EPS guide when taking our IP R&D charges into account. The incretin market continues to grow rapidly, and Mounjaro and Zepbound are both gaining share of market. We believe both products are still very early in their launch cycle. In addition, our oncology, immunology, and neuroscience therapeutic areas continue to progress, launching new medicines and delivering strong revenue growth.\nWe have an exciting outlook for growth in 2025 as well. New indications, new manufacturing capacities, new access opportunities, and new markets are all tailwinds to our financial performance. We made significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 and have several exciting readouts, which Dan just highlighted, expected throughout 2025. So now let me turn the call over to Mike to moderate our Q&A session.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call on time. So to that end, consistent with prior quarters, we will respond to one question per caller, and we'll end at 11:00AM. If you have more than one question, you may re-enter the queue, and we will get to your question if time allows. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready to take the first caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality.\nPlease hold while we pull for questions. The first question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much. Just a question on the guidance, the 2025 guidance. So I think everyone knows the prescription uptake trend didn't show acceleration, hasn't shown it yet. That's been viewed by some as a concern. Does the 2025 guidance require acceleration, or can you get their scripts just continue on the same trajectory and the slope of that line doesn't change? When I do back of the envelope math, it seems like that's frankly all that needs to occur.\nAnd one of your slides suggests that might be the right way to think about it as well, but can you just confirm?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll go to Lucas to talk about the guidance assumptions.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, we mentioned in my notes that what we expect to see, Tim, is a continuation of basically the total prescription growth that we have seen in 2024. So that's what we built in our 2025 guide.\nTo the market.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terrence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Pharma & Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much. I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on your expectations for Zepbound payer dynamics and access this year, particularly the impact from the OSA label. I know you've also filed for heart failure, and how you expect that to play out over the course of the year. And then anything on next steps on the compounding litigation that we should be focused on. Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDangerously close to a two-part question there, Terrence, but we'll go to Patrik to talk about access, and then I'll come back to Dave to make a quick comment about compounding.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you very much. When we look at the commercial access, it remains strong. We have 87% coverage in the commercial space still. And of course, the employer opt-in is a second step of high importance. We made progress in 2024, and we expect in terms of employer opt-in that we are north of 50% today. OSA remains an opportunity for us to gain access also in the medical segment.\nAnd CMS confirmed recently that they will reimburse OSA if Part D plans decide to list it. And they have 180 days to make that decision from the FDA approval, and we're working with plans right now. And we anticipate to get some medical coverage by the second half of this year. And similarly, OSA is also an opportunity for us to get more Medicaid states signed in. We expect PIF, when and if approved, to have a similar role as OSA and access opportunity, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. So regarding compounding, I think our position has been pretty clear. We've been in supply since August, and the FDA took us off the list formally later in Q4. Of course, the compounding associations are suing to delay that. We oppose that, I've opposed that suit. I think the next date coming up is 18 February 2024, where the FDA said that's when you need to stop one form of compounding.\nOur position has been clear all along. We don't think there's a place for this because we have full supply, and there's no reason to have a non-approved, kind of illegitimate product out there. So, of course, new sheriff in town, new government, and court case pending. So we don't know the outcome of all that. But that all said, I mean, I think our business is growing nicely in Q4, and we can see that in prescription trends early this year. It's just an unsafe practice that shouldn't exist, and long-term probably isn't great for innovators.\nSo we'd like to move on from this and hope that's what the courts and the government decide to do.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, David and Patrik. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for taking the call today. I just wanted to zoom into Orfoglipron specifically, and I think you took the chance to make the point about diabetes and diabetes population and their weight loss. Can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the potential positioning, particularly in the context of kind of that single injectable GLP-1 kind of anticipated efficacy that you're guiding to?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Courtney. We'll go to Dan to talk about the right comp for Orfoglipron.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. I'll start on the efficacy expectations, and then maybe Patrik can talk about the market positioning here. So you're right, it's a single GLP-1, and we take pains to mention that because we're not expecting the kinds of efficacy or tolerability, actually, that we see with tirzepatide, which is a dual-acting agent. Still, as you know, monotherapy with GLP-1 has provided important benefits to many patients, and so we're setting our sights there. This is a first study in type 2 diabetes patients where, as I noted, weight loss is typically quite a bit lower than you see in people without type 2 diabetes. So we sort of index on the efficacy that we've seen in the past with Ozempic, and we'll get that data soon and excited to see it. Patrik?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAnd from a positioning perspective, you know, we like the idea of having an oral with an injectable GLP-1-like efficacy. There is a big portion of patients who actually have needle phobia. It's estimated in the US to be 20% to 25%. And also a group of patients that doesn't necessarily need the amount of weight loss or HbA1c reduction as tirzepatide generates. And that might be an opportunity in the maintenance space as well. But lastly, and very importantly, it's an opportunity to scale in markets outside the US, taking into account that we don't have a need for refrigeration.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Patrik and Dan. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Just another Orfoglipron question. You've now launched a pretty wide range of studies, I guess, to say hypertension beyond the initial obesity and type 2 diabetes studies. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what gives you confidence in running such a wide range of programs while having seen those initial readouts, particularly maybe some of the tolerability profiles with the drug's titration, etc.? I'm just trying to think of how you balance kind of the risk-taking there with the confidence in the asset you have right now. Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for that question.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. It's a smart question. Of course, going into phase III with any drug, particularly a small molecule such as Orfoglipron, the biggest risk is safety. And I think as these trials proceed, even though we're not seeing the safety data, we grow more confident in the overall safety profile of the drug because the trials continue uninterrupted. Of course, we won't know for sure until we get that first data readout and then subsequent data readouts. But it's correct that we grow more and more confident in the success of this molecule as each day passes.\nAs for specifics around tolerability, titration, and discontinuations, those don't really factor into our thinking. We haven't had a look at unblinded data for any of those things, so we can't make assumptions on that yet.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Jeff, your line is live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citibank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just had one on commercial tirzepatide in bigger settings like diabetes prevention or if the CVOT is successful. Would these be a tipping point on broader reimbursement or access? I mean, it's clear you have a benefit there, but I wasn't sure if commercial payers or Medicare are looking for yet even more data to support kind of risk-benefit. Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Geoff. We'll go to Patrik to talk about the broader landscape there.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSo thank you very much, Geoff. I think the Summit One extension is definitely defined as game-changing at the provider level, and we are in discussions, of course, with regulatory agencies, but there is no precedent for type 2 prevention as an indication. But the data itself, I think we will utilize to really drive increased employer opt-in, seeing the benefits of outcome studies and treatment of people with prediabetes and obesity.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe just a broader point, which we've said before, Jeff. I think a lot of investors are looking for some single event that will trigger the broad reimbursement or not. I don't think we've ever really thought of it that way, but rather an accumulation and sort of weight of everything that will grow reimbursement steadily over time. I think that's actually what we've seen since we launched Zepbound last year. US commercial insurance picking up several points during the year. Even XUS now, we have UK reimbursement, etc.\nBut different payers will make different decisions at different times. I think the data sets you mentioned will be some of the more compelling to create moves, but still, then the way affordability and budget constraints, etc. That all said, by the time we get to the end of the decade, it's hard to imagine we are not using obesity medications to prevent what is the precursor condition to so many chronic diseases. And already the health economics are pretty compelling, and there'll be more data coming beyond that. So long-term, we remain really bullish on this whole category being reimbursed like we expect to reimburse all other medications. Just the schedule for that is going to be more slow and steady, I would say, to model expectations on a global scale and in the US as well because of the diversity of payers.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, David and Patrik. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Seamus, your line is live.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi, this is Colleen on for Seamus. Thanks for taking our question. We just wanted to ask on the sustainability of operating margin expansions. Looking at some of the longer-term forecasting from sell-side consensus, we're seeing estimates nearing 50% by the end of the decade. Do you view this as realistic, or how are you thinking about the balance between the margins and then also ensuring you're not under-investing on a pipeline?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question, Colleen. We'll go to Lucas to talk about the long-term operating margin philosophy.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWell, we are very pleased with the results that we've seen in 2024 and Q4, and we provided a guidance for 2025 that is a continuation of that margin expansion. I mentioned 340 basis points expansion in 2025. Thinking more long-term, our view is how we continue to drive growth in a sustainable manner. In order to do so, we believe that reinvesting into the business, in particular in R&D, to drive that innovation and growth into the future is a critical success factor for our business. So from that perspective, we mentioned before that we believe that getting into high 40s or 50% is not actually a good way to drive that sustainable growth into the future.So what we are seeing now on that low 40s is, in particular at this time, the right basically balance that we have in terms of investment into the business and also the returns that we generate as well.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Lucas. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nConor MacKay\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi there. This is Connor MacKay on for Evan. Thanks for taking our question. Given some of the slower launches we've seen from peers in the Alzheimer's space, can you maybe talk a bit about the lessons you've taken from those and then as well as from your experience early days in the Kisunla launch? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Connor, for the question. We'll go to Anne to talk about Kisunla.\n\nAnne White\n\nPresident of Lilly Neuroscience, (Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWell, thanks so much for the question about Kisunla. And I'll tell you, we are pleased with our momentum so far. What our team is focused on really is system readiness and growth. That's still a significant area of opportunity in the space. So we're partnering with healthcare providers to scale and reach more patients. As far as how it's going so far, Lucas mentioned key indicators that we're watching. To date, we've achieved P&T approvals of over 80% in our key accounts.\nWe have over 800 prescribers. And then an important leading indicator is the diagnostics front. And those results also continue to be encouraging. Amyvid use is more than doubling in the last year, and the use of blood diagnostics grows significantly each month as well. The true challenge here is the healthcare system's readiness, and I think most critically the capacity to detect and diagnose patients. And so we have a number of solutions that we're working on with the healthcare providers to help them increase that capacity, increase the throughput for patients, a lot of educational series as well on how to quickly diagnose and treat these patients.\nImportantly, I think we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm about the profile of Kisunla, and that actually helps with these capacity constraints. The once-monthly infusions, the ability to stop dosing once plaques have cleared, all of those, physicians have told us, are going to help with some of these capacity constraints. So it's been a strong start so far. We did really learn lessons from the first launch that went out there and applying that learning to what we're doing now, but it's been really positive so far in terms of the level of support and collaboration that Lilly's been able to bring with her expertise in the field and our long relationships with these customers.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Anne. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is live.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's certainly very encouraging to see the range of new phase III trials being initiated with Orfoglipron in the past few months. But there's one trial in particular I noticed has not been initiated or may not be in the plans, which is an outcomes trial. I'm just curious what's the thought process behind that. Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Umer, for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk about the orfoglipron development plan.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Umer. Of course, we're trying to cover a broad landscape of indications here that we think would be important and fit with the advantages an oral medication has, sort of primary care broad-use kinds of applications being prioritized. Outcome studying is an interesting idea. The challenges here in maintaining patients on placebo make it more and more difficult to do those kinds of studies in the US, but it's certainly an idea that we're exploring around the world and more thinking to come in the future.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nWell, thank you so much. I apologize in advance for this question, but over the past six to nine months, there has been a consistent cadence of data points questioning the size of the addressable and accessible obesity market, none of which are news but include slowing prescription trends, Lilly meeting demand at least a year early, Lilly instituting DTC and extending copay cards despite struggling to meet demand, Lilly launching in OUS markets despite struggling to meet US demand, and significant stocking fluctuations in channels and guidance. So taken collectively, these points are concerning. I think you will say that they all relate to the unprecedented size of the market and meeting its demand, but can you state that there has not been any conversations within Lilly questioning whether we are all significantly over our skis on this market and that the manufacturing buildout may simply be too aggressive? Thank you.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Well, Steve, thanks for the apology and the question. I'll go to Dave for that one.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Steve, I think you've been calling into our calls for most of my career. I've never had the apology upfront, so I appreciate that. I know why you're asking it. And I think the perspective we have is that it's early days on a very, very large opportunity. There's turbulence. I'll own that.\nWe always seek to put projections out that we can hit with confidence, but that are also within the range of possibilities. And in the back half of that year, last year, we fell short of that. But everything we've said is true, and we continue to believe in that this is a market with hundreds of millions of people globally, that there is a unique thing here, and that we can both prevent a large portion of chronic disease with obesity drugs. And last year, we saw proof points on that from Lilly and our competitor. That's not just weight loss. It translates into chronic disease outcomes. You'll hear and see more of that.\nAnd people love taking these drugs. We know that because when we run out, which we did last year, they get very angry with us. And so I, being a person who represents to the board the CapEx decisions, I have zero doubt that we have still more building to do and that the capacity we've put in the ground so far is not sufficient to meet global demand. You'll hear more about that from us. Of course, as highlighting on this call, we're getting close to, I think, a relief valve on that, which is the idea that you could have an oral, which is scalable in a way that injectable systems just aren't, really test the question legitimately, what is the edge of the demand curve? But we don't think we're close to it right now.\nWe're still gating promotion and gating launches globally. That's a different thing. And we're building facilities as fast as we can to match up those two things, what we can make and what we can sell. And although we're supplying the US market well right now, we'll need to do more. And I'm pretty confident in that. So hopefully that gives you some color on the mindset here and wouldn't overread the turbulence and prediction challenges we have.\nLong-term, we're very bullish, and you'll see us act according to that belief.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nBiopharma Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding sleep apnea. Now that you have sleep apnea on Zepbound label, how have the discussions with the prescribers as well as payers have gone so far? The one pushback we hear is that these patients are often treated by sleep specialists, and there's a general shortage of those specialists here. So could you talk a little bit about the call points and then how you're thinking about this?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mohit. We'll go to Patrik for the question on sleep apnea, what the discussions are like with some of the prescribers, and the initial experience so far.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you very much, Mohit. Yes, you're correct. It's the first pharmacological treatment ever approved for obstructive sleep apnea. There is a lot of lifting on our side, and we will approach that as we are approaching any new disease area, partnering with advocacy organizations, healthcare providers, and massive efforts in terms of medical education. We expect this to go beyond the sleep specialists, but of course, we are starting our efforts with the sleep specialist community, and I think that's been very well received so far. And we are meeting with them regularly, conducting speaker trainings, but with the aim to move to primary care, which is a necessity because this is also a patient population that, to a large extent, remains undiagnosed.\nSo primary care efforts are going to be required.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Patrik. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Dave, your line is live.\n\nDave Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much. My incretin-related questions have been asked. I wanted to just pivot to the long-acting relaxin candidate, long-acting relaxin. The company had advanced it into a CKD trial in the fourth quarter, but then recently canceled both the heart failure and CKD programs. Dan, I'm hoping you could provide some more color on what drove the action, plus how you now view the long-acting relaxin mechanism, including potential for future development in other cardiopulmonary diseases. Thanks very much.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave. We'll go to Dan to talk about the long-acting relaxin program.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. I was disappointed with the results from the phase II trial, for sure. Relaxin is an interesting mechanism, I think, sort of validated by normal human physiology during pregnancy. But unfortunately, the results that we got in this trial didn't support proceeding with this molecule. I read that as speaking to the mechanism, but rather than the molecule. But I know others are pursuing this mechanism, and I wish some success where we didn't have it. So we'll have to wait and see.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nThanks so much. So at JPMorgan, your team mentioned you expect GLP-1 pricing to be relatively stable in 2025. Are you implying that while you'll give additional discounts to the channel to improve access, that will be offset by improved adherence, or is it more Lilly's reached a steady state on discounts, at least until semaglutide gets put under IRA negotiation in 2026? Thanks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAll right. Thanks, Akash. We'll go to Lucas to talk about GLP-1 price insurance.\n\nLucas Montarce\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question. In terms of the price insurance that I alluded to in the JPMorgan conference and getting into 2025, first, we talk about the Q4. And into 2025, what we mentioned basically is a continuation of the trends. Remember that we had in the base period in 2023, an uncovered copay that basically created quite a lot of noise on the year-on-year comparison. So we talk about basically adjusting by that, still single-digit erosion on our pricing trends, and that is the same trends that I alluded that will continue into 2025. In terms of some of the dynamics on the access side, I don't know if you want to comment anything, Patrik, on your side.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nI think we have really good access on the Mounjaro side, over 90% in commercial and Part D, and I've already covered the commercial space for Zepbound. We expect access to continue to improve in 2025 as well. In terms of adherence, I think we just need to reflect on the dynamics that we have experienced in this market, partly due to supply constraints, but we are encouraged with what we see on Mounjaro for patients that started in Q2 2023. We actually see a longer adherence with Mounjaro than we do with both Trulicity and Ozempic. As Dave referred to earlier, in terms of Zepbound, we expect adherence to be long here based upon the first-hand experiences that consumers have.\n\nMike Czapar",
    "content2": "SVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Patrik. Thank you, Lucas. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Alexandria, your line is live.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector of Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking the question. With the Ro partnership, how does Lilly envision this relationship evolving? And a follow-up, can you help frame the opportunity associated with Zepbound vials, and how is it expected to shift over time?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Alex. We'll go to Patrik to talk about Zepbound vials and Rowe.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. We launched the self-pay system with Lilly Direct back in late August, and we are pleased with the performance so far. In terms of TRX for Zepbound, it's still low to mid-single digit, but in terms of new therapy start, it's actually in the low teen, so a very good start. The partnership with Ro is not a financial or a marketing partnership at all. It's just the opportunity for eligible patients to have the option of using the Ro platform to purchase FDA-approved authentic medicines. It's really about connecting that software to Lilly Direct self-pay pharmacy.\nWe will lean into additional partnerships along those lines with partners that really want to ensure that the patients get access to authentic and FDA-approved medicines.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Patrik. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live. Chris, please go ahead with your question. Your line is live.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nApologies. I was on mute. For the orfoglipron launch, you previously stated that you're doing manufacturing scale-up to be prepared for a full launch at potential approval. What is embedded in that assumption? Can you talk a little bit about the approach for timing of orfoglipron in terms of diabetes versus obesity? Will it be simultaneous or one before the other?\nUS versus international? We certainly saw the injectable business do a prioritized US launch. Should we also expect the similar kind of \"new product launch cadence\" with patient assistance programs and the implementation of channel tools like Lilly Direct? Should all those be at the outset? Thanks.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Chris, for the very detailed question. We'll go to Dave to talk a bit about the Orforglipron launch prep.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Waiting for all allocation at some point. Yeah. Look, the goal here with Orfoglipron is because it's using different production systems that are available to us. It's a long cycle of processing to get commercial product, but that's very predictable, and we have access to those platforms inside and outside the company. So we are building for a full launch in the normal pharma sense. And here, pointing out maybe the flip of the earlier question about demand, we have had to gate all these things to make sure we carefully match supply and demand for the injectables, as our competitor.\nWe do not plan for that with orfoglipron. So we will plan to launch or submit and have approvals and then launch in a full sense, including activities you're used to seeing for primary care products like sampling, copay, full formulary access, and globalization of orfoglipron as rapidly as possible. And we're building capacities to do that, and hopefully that will begin in early 2026. I think, as Dan mentioned, the first complete package for submission in the US will be obesity. But we expect diabetes to shortly follow and then these other indications that have been discussed today. Hope that answers the question.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Another one for Dan on orfoglipron. I appreciate the earlier comments on indexing orfoglipron's efficacy to SEMA and the Phase 3 titration schedule. Sorry, excuse me. But can you go over how this titration schedule may impact the Phase 2 weight loss A1C and safety results published in Lancet and New England Journal? Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, James, for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk more about orfoglipron.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. It's a good question, James, and reminiscent of the theme we had when the tirzepatide trials were going. It was a similar transition from a faster titration in phase 2 to a more gradual titration in phase III. I think that strategy served us well in the case of tirzepatide. I'm hopeful for the same kind of outcomes in orforglipron, which is to say that it mitigated tolerability concerns. So the GI side effects that are just known to this class seem to be significantly mitigated by slower titration.\nAnd in longer studies, and the first study to read out is not the longest study we have here, in longer studies, we were still able to obtain the sort of plateau kind of efficacy that we expect for the mechanism. So that's what we're hoping for orforglipron, better tolerability, and similar efficacy as phase II.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So for the first orfoglipron study on diabetes, thank you so much for the level set there. I have a similar question on retatrutide. We noticed in your slides there was a phase III readout in obesity and overweight patients with osteoarthritis of the knee as a potential event for 2025. So one of the primary endpoints is weight loss. Could that be a reasonable comp for the obesity studies in 2026, unlike what you've flagged with orfoglipron and diabetes?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Trung. We'll go to Dan to talk about retatrutide.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. I'm glad you asked the question. It's a super smart question. You're probably noticing that the osteoarthritis trial is shorter than any of the other ones. We've commented before that retatrutide is going to need longer trials. Most of ours are 80-week plus trials to reach maximal efficacy.\nThis is a 68-week trial. I think we also know, at least by analogy from the SEMA trials that looked at osteoarthritis and obesity versus a more pure obesity population, that even for similar length studies, there's a diminution of efficacy in terms of weight loss in the OA population for a number of reasons, including different baseline demographics, male, female, BMI, etc. So I think we know how to extrapolate out from the OA population to the general population, but I don't think you should take the OA population as a point estimate for what will be achieved in a broader obesity population. We should do quite a bit better than that.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Kripa, your line is live.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking our question. This is Nicole on for Kripa. Can we see some BMI data this year, and do you still see some benefit with a muscle-preserving drug? The recent data from Versanis showed preservation of lean mass, but no incremental weight loss. So with BMI, do you expect incremental weight loss or weight neutral, but better body composition? Is that what you're looking for?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk a bit about how we're thinking about the BMI data.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for a good question on Bimagrumab. I think our thesis here has been in combination with tirzepatide that we could get incremental weight loss or perhaps a similar weight loss, but as you point out, with preservation of what we call lean mass. I think to really show a benefit for combining the two drugs, we're probably going to either need to see the incremental weight loss or we're going to need to see some real functional benefits to lean mass preservation. I think just lean mass on its own, we don't really know how to understand that. And we previously noted that we don't see any signs that lean mass changes on tirzepatide or, to my knowledge, on any incretin are actually adverse in any way.\nOn the other hand, growing muscle could be a positive in different ways. So we're looking for new positive effects with bimagrumab. The beginning of your question, I realize I didn't come to, which is when do we see the previous phase 2 study, which was completed? We haven't been clear on exactly when we'll show that data, but this year is a safe assumption.\n\nMike Czapar\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. I think we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe final question today will be a follow-up from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Dave, your line is live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks very much. I was just hoping you could clarify the comment earlier. I think there was a comment about additional PBM coverage coming in March. I didn't quite catch that. If you could just provide some more color, and quantify the potential impact on the opportunity for script trends following that occurring. Thank you.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nLet me cover that, and then I'll just close. I think, Dave, that was referred to Ebglyss, which is very new in cycle, and we do expect two of the three PBMs to cover it, and that gets us excited about activating consumers and raising awareness for that brand. Zepbound and Mounjaro have full PBM coverage already.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSo great. Let's conclude it there. Thanks for dialing in, everyone, and your interest in today's earnings call and, of course, in everything about Eli Lilly and Company. If you've got follow-up questions or things we didn't cover in enough detail today in the Q&A, please follow up with the IR team. Mike Czapar leads that now. And everyone, have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

Please hold the line, and we'll be right back with you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q2 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Should you request assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO, Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Gordon Brooks, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience, Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly International, Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology, and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA.\nWe're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether, and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide four.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Joe. It's an exciting time here at Lilly as our growth trajectory accelerated in the Q2. Our investments in advancing innovative medicines and our focus on manufacturing expansion are bringing Lilly medicines to more people around the world. On slide five, you can see details of the financial performance in the Q2 and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 36% in Q2, with our new products growing nearly $3.5 billion compared to the same period last year.\nUS demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is strong and growing as access and supply continue to expand. While weekly prescription volume was volatile in the first half of the year due to challenges fulfilling high demand, our progress on supply gives us confidence in our outlook. Q2 saw impressive performance across other areas of the business as well.\nExcluding the sale of the rights to Baqsimi last year, non-incretin growth was 17% worldwide, with growth spread across geographies, including 25% growth in the United States. Our $3 billion increase in revenue guidance reflects our expectation that momentum will accelerate through the balance of the year.\nWe achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the approval of Kisunla, the brand name for donanemab in the US for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the approval of Jaypirca in Japan for people with relapse or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors, the submission of tirzepatide in the US and the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, and the positive top-line results from the SUMMIT phase III trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity.\nLilly now has a significant opportunity to create new medicines through a broad internal portfolio and active business development to support our long-term growth. In obesity, our strategy is to comprehensively address this global public health crisis, pursuing opportunities against every rational mechanism, indication, and dosage form. We are investing broadly in this disease and now have 11 new molecules currently in the clinic across multiple indications.\nWe're also investing in a wide range of late-stage phase III programs. We recently shared the positive data of tirzepatide in OSA and HFpEF. Our orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 small molecule, has a comprehensive phase III program underway in diabetes and obesity, with nine trials currently running and readouts starting mid-next year.\nWith retatrutide, our GIP GLP-1 glucagon triagonist, we have initiated a broad phase III development program studying the molecule in obesity, OSA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes, as well as type II diabetes. These readouts start in 2026. A top priority remains executing on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. In May, we announced plans to invest an additional $5.3 billion in our Lebanon, Indiana manufacturing site, bringing our total investment there to $9 billion.\nWe believe this is the largest single investment in synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing in the history of the United States. Importantly, this expansion will enhance capacity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Zepbound and Mounjaro. Since 2020, we have committed more than $18 billion to build, upgrade, or acquire facilities in the US and Europe, and we've begun to see the benefit of these investments.\nWe are making near-term progress to ramp production, including at new sites like Research Triangle Park, existing Lilly sites, and at contract manufacturing organizations. Our Concord, North Carolina, site is progressing well. We're in the process of running validation, and our next US facility will initiate production by the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025. We also continue to make progress on different presentations for tirzepatide. We have now launched our multi-dose KwikPen in multiple markets outside the US, with positive early indicators of patient adoption.\nIn Gordon's remarks, he will preview our plans to launch vials here in the US. Lastly, in terms of external innovation, in July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Morphic, a biopharma company developing oral integrin therapies for treatment of serious chronic diseases, including a phase II asset being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease.\nOn slide six, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. As we announced in June, Anat Ashkenazi resigned as Lilly's Chief Financial Officer to become the CFO of Alphabet. We wish Anat well in her new role and thank her for her partnership and leadership of our financial organization over the last three years. We have named Gordon Brooks, Interim CFO, while an internal and external search for Anat's successor is currently underway.\nGordon has been with the company for 29 years and also serves as our controller and the leader of the corporate strategy group for the company. In other leadership news, Alonzo Weems, our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Risk Management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will retire at the end of the year after 27 years of service.\nMelissa Seymour has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Global Quality and a member of the company's executive committee following Johna Norton's recent retirement. I want to thank Alonzo for his many years of service and welcome Melissa to the Lilly team. Now let me turn the call over to Gordon to review our Q2 financial results.\n\nGordon Brooks\n\nInterim CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. So I'm on slide seven, which summarizes the financial performance in the Q2 of 2024. Q2 revenue growth of 36% was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound, as well as Verzenio, and excluding revenue from the sale of rights to Baqsimi in Q2 of last year, revenue grew 46%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 79.8% in Q2 of 2023 to 82% in Q2 of 2024.\nGross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable product mix and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher production costs. R&D expenses increased 15%, driven by continued investment in our portfolio and in our people. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by promotional efforts associated with ongoing and future launches, as well as investment in our people.\nOperating income increased 90% in Q2, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.5% in Q2 2024, compared with 16.1% in Q2 2023. The Q2 2024 tax rate reflects a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, while the Q2 2023 rates reflected the impact of earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi.\nAt the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.92 in Q2, an 86% increase compared to the prior year. Q2 2024 results include the negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.09 in the prior quarter, Q2 2023. On slide nine, we quantify the effects of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. US revenue increased 42% in Q2.\nVolume growth of 27% was driven by Zepbound, Mounjaro, and Verzenio, partially offset by the sale of rights for Baqsimi in Q2 of 2023 and declined Trulicity. Realized prices increased 15%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. As noted in our Q1 and 2024 earnings call, unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler back orders at the end of Q1. In Q2, we fulfilled the majority of these back orders, improving wholesaler stocking levels.\nWe estimate that US Mounjaro and Zepbound aggregate sales in the Q2 were positively impacted by channel stocking, and we estimate totaled high teens to mid-20s% of US sales as we rebuilt inventory from extremely low levels in the spring and to account for the growth of these brands.\nWe're pleased that the improved supply situation is reflected on the FDA shortage website, which currently shows all doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound listed as available, and the two lower doses of Trulicity listed as available. While wholesaler back orders in the US have been reduced substantially, it's important to note that the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, more so for medicines that require refrigeration and offer several different doses.\nThese factors may continue to result in variability in the patient experience at the pharmacy counter. While supply and demand has come into better balance, we expect increases in demand may result in periodic supply tightness for certain presentations and dose levels. We have a continued broad agenda to further increase supply and will continue to look at all options.\nToday, we are excited to announce plans to further expand access for Zepbound with the launch of the 2.5mg and 5mg single-dose vials in the coming weeks, with more details to come at that time. In Europe, revenue grew 20% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro launch uptake in the UK and Germany. We also had strong volume growth from Verzenio and Jardiance, which was partially offset by decreased volume from Trulicity.\nJapan performance was strong in the Q2, with 15% revenue growth in constant currency. Volume growth of 21% was driven by uptake of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Moving to China, Q2 revenue increased 1% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Tyvyt, Olumiant, and Taltz, partially offset by Trulicity and Cialis. Mounjaro was recently approved in China for type II diabetes and chronic weight management.\nWe have not yet announced expected launch timing in this market. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 61% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro volume growth from demand and channel dynamics. Slide 10 provides additional perspective on performance across our product categories. Verzenio had solid growth in the Q2 across major geographies, with worldwide sales increasing 44%, driven by the early breast cancer indication.\nJaypirca revenue increased to $92 million worldwide, which included a $19 million partner milestone payment related to Japan. Jaypirca continued impressive quarter-over-quarter growth, building on the brand's uptake from both the MCL and CLL patient populations. Omvoh was launched in the US and 14 international markets, with sales of $26 million in Q2. These launches continued to progress well, with increasing patient starts.\nIn the US, we expect sales to accelerate as the product-specific J code went live on 1 July 2024. Mounjaro sales in Q2 were $3.1 billion globally, with $2.4 billion in the US. Revenue growth in the US reflected continued strong demand, as well as the improved channel dynamics discussed earlier. We're seeing solid uptake of Mounjaro outside the US, with sales in Q2 totaling $677 million.\nIn H1 2024, we launched the KwikPen presentation in the UK, Germany, and the UAE. So far in Q3, we have also launched Mounjaro KwikPen in Spain and plan to launch in additional markets throughout 2024. In Q2, worldwide, Trulicity revenue declined 31%. US Trulicity revenue decreased 36%, driven by lower volume, primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints, partially offset by improved wholesaler stocking levels on certain doses.\nTurning to slide 11, we have an update on the US launch of Zepbound. We've seen exceptional growth trends for Zepbound that have accelerated as production has ramped, leading to sales of over $1.2 billion in Q2. We're rapidly building out formulary coverage for Zepbound in the US and, as of 1 July, had approximately 86% access in the commercial segment. We estimate over 50% of employers have opted into anti-obesity medicine coverage and see that modestly growing as we work to expand coverage.\nOn slide 12, we provide an update on our capital allocation. Slide 13 shows our updated 2024 financial guidance. We're raising our full-year revenue outlook by $3 billion to be between $45.4 billion and $46.6 billion. This increase is due to strong performance across our non-incretin medicines, as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nAdditionally, we have improved clarity into the timing and face of our production expansion and Mounjaro launches outside the US. We achieved a number of supply-related milestones in Q2 and have increased confidence regarding our expectation that production of saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the saleable doses in the second half of 2023. Based on the midpoint of the range, our updated guidance implies revenue growth of 38% in the second half of the year, following 31% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we're expecting more significant growth in Q4 compared to Q3.\nGiven the updated revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less half X divided by revenue to be in the range of 36% to 38% on a reported basis and 37% to 39% on a non-GAAP basis. For other income and expense, we now expect between $525 million and $425 million of expense on a reported basis and between $400 million and $300 million of expense on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect lower expected net interest expense, and the reported range reflects net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 of 2024.\nWe have increased our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, driven by changes in our forecasted mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.10 to 15.60 on a reported basis and $16.10 to 16.60 on a non-GAAP basis.\nBoth ranges reflect the updates mentioned earlier, as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q2 of $0.24. The reported range includes a charge in Q2 2024 associated with anticipated litigation payments. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Gordon. It's been another busy quarter. I'll start with comments on the Kisunla FDA approval, then the tirzepatide heart failure phase III readout, and finally, I'll cover the rest of the updates for the quarter. We are, of course, very excited about the FDA approval of Kisunla for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We followed the June Advisory Committee meeting, where we had another chance to present and discuss the compelling data package characterizing the safety and efficacy of this medicine.\nWe were pleased by the discussion of the FDA advisors, particularly with regard to our data supporting stopping of Kisunla therapy when amyloid plaques are removed to minimal levels. In our trial, nearly half of study participants completed their course of treatment with Kisunla in 12 months.\nWe believe limited duration therapy, along with a once-monthly infusion schedule, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions required. The vote was unanimously positive on all questions presented, and a few weeks later, the FDA approved Kisunla, including labeling that physicians may consider stopping dosing of Kisunla based on reduction of amyloid plaques. Following the July approval, we launched Kisunla, and we're delighted to see that patients have already begun receiving this new Lilly medicine as part of clinical practice.\nWe note that Kisunla is broadly covered for Medicare patients through approved CED registries. Regulatory reviews continue around the world, with potential action yet this year in several countries. We're pleased to have recently received a positive opinion for donanemab from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. And finally, our phase III prevention study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, continues to progress as planned.\nMoving to tirzepatide, on slide 14, you'll see the recent positive results of our SURMOUNT phase III trial, which evaluated tirzepatide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity. This study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints for tirzepatide, maximum tolerated dose compared to placebo. In the first primary endpoint, tirzepatide reduced the risk of worsening heart failure by 38% compared to placebo, as measured by a composite outcome of heart failure, urgent visit or hospitalization, oral diuretic intensification, or cardiovascular death.\nThe median follow-up for this endpoint was 104 weeks. In the second primary endpoint, tirzepatide significantly improved heart failure symptoms and physical limitations compared to placebo, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, KCCQ, clinical summary score.\nMain changes from baseline in this measurement is 24.8 points for tirzepatide, while placebo was 15 points based on the efficacy estimate at 52 weeks. All key secondary endpoints were met in the study, including mean body weight reduction of 15.7% compared to 2.2% for placebo. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in the Surmount trial was consistent with previously reported tirzepatide studies, including SURMOUNT and SURPASS. We will present detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting and submit to a peer-reviewed journal.\nWe plan to submit results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies starting later this year. In other updates across our portfolio, slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of 6 August 2024, and slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. I'll start with updates in cardiometabolic health, which is the new name of our internal business, formerly known as Lilly Diabetes and Obesity.\nIn June, we published detailed results for our phase III trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we presented results at the American Diabetes Association meeting. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Notably, in one of our key secondary endpoints, as shown on slide 17, tirzepatide demonstrated that up to 51.5% of participants met the criteria for disease resolution of sleep apnea.\nWe've now submitted tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity to the FDA, as well as the EMA. We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation, and we expect US regulatory action as early as the end of 2024, which will be dependent on the FDA granting priority review.\nAlso in June, we published results in the New England Journal from our phase II trial of tirzepatide for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, with stage two or three fibrosis, and we presented these results at the European Association for the Study of the Liver. We were pleased to show that in a secondary endpoint, more than half of the patients taking tirzepatide achieved improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks, as shown on slide 18.\nWe're engaged with regulatory authorities on a potential phase III registration strategy, and we're also encouraged by the potential read-through of these results to retatrutide, which also showed significant improvements in liver fat in phase II. This quarter, we also announced top-line data from two phase III trials for our once-weekly insulin called Efsitora alfa.\nThe QUINT-2 and QUINT-4 trials for the treatment of type II diabetes each met their primary endpoints of non-inferior A1C reduction. QUINT-2 compared Efsitora to once-daily insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin-naive adults. QUINT-4 compared Efsitora to insulin glargine for 26 weeks in adults previously treated with daily basal insulin and at least two injections per day of mealtime insulin. In both QUINT-2 and QUINT-4, Efsitora was safe and well tolerated.\nDetailed trial results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting. We look forward to sharing additional data from the QUINT program later this year.\nWe're pleased with our progress to provide breakthrough innovation to patients who require insulin, progressing our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist molecule in phase I and investing in approaches aimed at disease modification for type I diabetes, such as islet cell therapy. In other late-phase updates, we've initiated triumph outcomes, a phase III trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and renal function for patients taking retatrutide. Earlier in our cardiometabolic pipeline, you'll see additional incretin molecules in phase I.\nIncretins are an important part of our portfolio strategy, and having multiple molecules in clinical development offers us potential optionalities as we look at opportunities to help patients across mechanisms, indications, dosages, formulations, and treatment schedules. To highlight a few, GLP-1 NPA II is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor designed for once-daily oral administration.\nWe expect this asset to move to phase II later this year, so we now identify it on our pipeline slide, whereas it had previously been listed as not disclosed. Given the diversity of indications to potentially pursue with incretins, we are excited about the possibility of having another oral option to help more patients with different diseases. We also highlight today GIP/GLP-1 Coagonist III, which is a next-generation dual agonist molecule, and we are planning to explore weekly and monthly dosing given its longer half-life.\nElsewhere in our cardiometabolic health portfolio, we have stopped development of an NRG4 agonist as the profile was insufficient for further clinical development. Turning to oncology, we are pleased that Jaypirca has now been approved in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors.\nIn early phase oncology, we've initiated the phase I trial for a second Nectin-4 ADC. We view this as an important target, and having two compounds in the clinic provides more opportunities to improve outcomes for patients. We've also initiated a phase I trial for our ADC targeting the folate receptor. This asset, which came from our acquisition of Mablink, is a next-generation construct designed to have efficacy at all folate receptor expression levels and with an improved therapeutic index relative to existing agents.\nWe're also announcing that we've terminated the LOXO-783 program, which targeted PI3 kinase alpha. We evaluated the ongoing clinical data from the program and compared the molecule to next-generation candidates that we have progressed from our discovery efforts.\nWe believe our next molecules have greater potential to benefit patients, and we look forward to putting our next candidate into the clinic in 2025 and sharing more about its profile later this year. In immunology, we've now submitted mirikizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Japan. We've terminated development for our GITR agonist antagonist due to insufficient efficacy. We also announced our acquisition of Morphic, and pending completion of the deal, we plan to reflect the oral alpha-4 beta-7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 in phase II for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nFinally, in neuroscience, our anti-Tau small molecule OGA inhibitor recently concluded its phase II study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. OGA failed to meet the primary endpoint of decreasing the change from baseline, as measured by iADRS, in either of the two dose levels tested.\nWe're reviewing the data for presentation of detailed results of the study at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease Conference later this year. While this negative outcome was disappointing, we remain committed to Tau as a high-conviction target in Alzheimer's disease and plan to continue studying Tau biology. I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the Q2. Exceptional revenue growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Verzenio. We are pleased with the ramp in production in the first half of the year and expect continued expansion ahead.\nSignificant advances in our pipeline include the approval of Kisunla for Alzheimer's disease, the submission of tirzepatide for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the US and Europe, and positive results from the phase III study of tirzepatide for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity. We are investing in product launches, the advancement of our pipeline, as well as our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda.\nAll of this and the incredible work of our teams around the world give Lilly leadership confidence that we have a very bright future ahead and better opportunity than at any time in our history to impact human health on a global scale. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner, so consistent with prior quarters.\nWe'll respond to one question per caller, so I'll ask that you limit to one question per caller, as we'll end the call at 11:00AM. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue, and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we pull for questions. The first question today is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOh, great. Thanks so much. And just, I'll stick with my one question. It really is on your awareness of ASP movements in the market, so the average selling price. By our calculations, when we sort of look at the ASP averages, removing rebates and inventory, etc., relative to comments made yesterday on Novo's call, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the market with regard to average selling price.\nThe prices look actually reasonably close to us, with the tirzepatide franchise having higher sort of ASP per script, but not dramatically higher given concerns of real pricing deterioration. I guess the only question that I have here is, what are you seeing from an ASP perspective, and do you see this as kind of the natural evolution of this market as competition emerges, as we saw with Ozempic historically and Trulicity in 2019?\nThanks so much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Seamus. I think I'll go to Gordon. Do you want to touch on that, or Patrik?\n\nGordon Brooks\n\nInterim CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. I'll hang up on that. Seamus, thanks for the question. Yeah, so just on price trends, initial favorability in the first half of the year was driven by Mounjaro, that goes away in the second half of the year as the copay program moves out of the base period.\nIn terms of pricing, we see stable pricing sequentially across quarters in 2024, so nothing unusual Q1 to Q2, and our guidance Q3 and Q4 continues stable sequential pricing. For the second half of the year, when you don't have the Mounjaro dynamic pricing, the second half will be similar to prior year pricing. So those are kind of the dynamics we see in pricing.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress on the manufacturing. Maybe just a two-part for me on that one. Just wondering if your initial guidance for the at least 1.5-fold increase in sellable doses include the Zepbound starter vials that you're rolling out in the US, or if that's a potential driver of upside. And then as we think about RTP, I know you're continuing to make progress there.\nThe scripts suggest you're at about a third of the way through the ramp to peak, but this inventory restock that you talked about today suggests maybe more of a meaningful step up. So just can you quantify for us where you are in the ramp in RTP? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. Dave, do you want to hop in and?\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, I can just handle it. So I think what we're saying today is just reiterating that 1.5 is sort of like a floor on how we think about second-half volume. I would say the vials are part of that, but given that we have about 20 weeks left in the year, there's a limit to how much of that will ship anyway. But they certainly open up a node of the most constrained part of the supply chain, which is still finishing the final container closure, and it uses different lines, obviously, than syringes or cartridges.\nSo it just adds to our capacity. Probably the most meaningful part of that will show up in early 2025, to be honest, as that new form ramps and details on that rollout will be coming in the coming weeks.\nAs it relates to RTP, I wouldn't read through that the Q2 step up in volume we shipped was primarily due to RTP. That site is on track, and we are steadily escalating production for our goals. I also mentioned Concord is doing well against its time schedule, and we expect product out of that site end of this year, early next year. But rather, maybe performance out of the totality of the network that allowed us to recover wholesale inventory levels in Q2 and now come off the FDA shortage list. It's more just overall performance across many, many nodes of our supply network.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on all the progress. This seems to be a broader debate on the role emerging earlier-stage competition in the obesity market could play, where that fits in the market broadly. I'm sure you're not surprised by the breadth of agents being developed in the space, but just interested in your latest views in terms of barriers to entry you see for some of these newer competitors and how you think about defending Lilly's market position over time. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe Dan, do you want to start on that, and then?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, I'll start with some R&D comments on barriers to entry. The first, I think, is having a successful drug in phase two clinical trials and getting it approved. You can see that we've invested thoroughly, I would say, in our phase three portfolio, often pursuing multiple indications in multiple populations at once. Just being able to get to that point, I know investors have gotten excited about various releases of phase I data, but it's still a challenging space to develop drugs, and we usually wait until we've seen pretty robust phase II data before we get too excited about a particular molecule.\nSo that's the first thing, and I think a lot of the news that we've seen from different companies will probably sort out as we get to see phase two data and which molecules make it, and which have the right profile, and which don't. But I wouldn't be expecting 100% success here.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe a few additional comments. I think when we look at the marketplace, there are two very important barriers. We have been extremely successful in gaining access across both Mounjaro, where we have currently 93% access in commercial and 89% in part D. Similarly, for Zepbound, 86% after seven months in the marketplace. That's quite significant.\nThe second piece is the amount of outcome indications. We are investing heavily in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, and similarly for the phase III assets of orforglipron and retatrutide. So I think overall, we think that we are extremely well positioned to compete here, and we are not surprised to see that most of the firms are actually leaning into this very important space.\nBut with the cards we have in our hands in the market today, the phase III assets, and what we refer to in the prepared remarks, we are well positioned to compete today and tomorrow. That goes across both different indications, assets, dual therapy, etc. All hands on deck on our side.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe one last thing to pile on. But here we're highlighting our pipeline gap at 11 assets, all different targets. But maybe just a reminder, Chris, we had our phase I MAD data for tirzepatide in 2016. That was eight years ago. And that's a massive lead, I think, over other GIP/GLP agonists that are behind us. On the oral side, you can get more in category differentiation based on target engagement, safety profiles, etc.\nBut here again, we have the most advanced program, and as Dan highlighted today, a follow-on program to add to that sort of portfolio we have there. Finally, one other barrier, but certainly it's work to do, is scaling manufacturing. The volume is really high in this category. Probably will end up being one of the highest volume categories in the history of the industry.\nYou're talking about making things on the billion scale, which takes time, is technically difficult, and very capital intensive. Of course, competitors will come, but there's a road ahead for all these that the two leading companies have already walked in large part.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you all. Next question, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. I have a question on compounders of GLP-1s, including but not limited to your tirzepatide. So companies like HIMS or anyone else, how can this not infringe patent protection? And is this something that is likely to get adjudicated in the courts, meaning that you and presumably Novo sue? An article just yesterday in The New York Times talked about patients getting upside down with compounded GLP-1s. I think they used the term overdosing on these compounded formulations. So not only do compounders take away sales from you guys, but it could also tarnish reputation of the class. So what can we expect Lilly to do about it?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Danny, you want to start with some comments?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for raising this important topic, Tim. Of course, we've been watching this carefully, not really out of concern that they're taking away our business, as you know. We've been largely supply constrained here, but rather the impact it's having on patient health. We often are able to secure samples from these kinds of compounding labs and analyze them in our own labs. And what we find, for the most part, in most instances, is this isn't compounded tirzepatide at all.\nOur drug is not available to compounders. Rather, they're purchasing either other chemicals entirely, which we often find, or fake producers of tirzepatide that is often full of impurities, sometimes contaminated by bacteria. This is a safety risk to patients that we take seriously, and trying to do everything we can to make patients aware of the potential dangers here so that we can help them.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. And just from a policy standpoint, I mean, you can expect us to be active here. We've taken public positions. We're obviously engaged with regulators and considering all kinds of legal actions and have filed some. Of course, compounding is a long-standing practice under the 503A provisions of FDA, which is meant to customize doses for individual patient needs. It's not clear to me medically what that would be for tirzepatide, but I guess that's legal in a sense.\nIt's the mass production that's concerning, and we don't see a lot of that with our medicine, more with the other one. But I think if we just step back and reflect on why this is happening, there's shortages because of parenteral manufacturing constraints in the industry and in the leading companies.\nA lot of that constraint is investing and proving those processes are compliant with the GMP standards that the FDA and Europe under Annex 1 have enforced. And we agree, by the way, with that strict enforcement. So it's a little odd that the answer to that constraint, which is about raising the standards of the industry to have sterile products, is to create another industry that has non-sterile products. So we're just pointing that out, and I think you can see Lilly on the front foot here over the coming months to address this. But ultimately, the real thing to address is increasing coverage on insurance and increasing supply.\nWe've made a lot of strides in supply. We'll step that up another notch with the availability of vials, and we need to work with primarily the government as well as employers to expand coverage so obesity medicines are affordable.\nI think when we get to those points, this will be a non-issue, but in the meantime, people can get hurt, and as Dan said, it's pretty concerning what's happening.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is live.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask on operating leverage, if I may. I know in Q1, when you guys raised the guidance by $2 billion on top line, it dropped down to EPS by $1.30. This quarter, guidance went up by $3 billion, but it dropped down at a much higher leverage at $2.16 EPS, almost a 90% incremental margin.\nMy question is not so much what your operating leverage is going to be in 2025 or a four-year guidance, but instead, I'm basically asking, if you annualize the momentum of your Q4 numbers per this year's guidance, the EPS upside implied to consensus could be almost as much as half of Lilly's entire full-year EPS where it stands right now.\nI'm just trying to think through how do you plan on spending on various functions and what the incremental margins could look like as the revenue momentum really kicks in with the improving supply. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Umer. There's a lot of financial mechanics that I'll hand to Gordon to comment on, I think, effectively capital allocation considerations.\n\nGordon Brooks\n\nInterim CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood. Thanks, Umer. Appreciate the question. Yeah, I mean, we've been speaking for a long time about operating margins and getting to the mid- to high-30% range. As we've seen this year, Mounjaro and Zepbound are taking an inflection point upwards, and so we're seeing ourselves at the top end of that range. For the first half, margins are a little inflated. We haven't yet leaned into all of our promotional channels and incretins.\nYou don't see, for instance, TV commercials on the incretins. We haven't done that given the supply situation. And on R&D, it takes time to scale R&D thoughtfully, so it doesn't always move exactly in sync quarter by quarter with revenue. That said, our guidance for the year does indicate we will stay in the upper 30% range for the full year with growth first half.\nIf you look at the first half, it's the two quarters growth into the second half. And you should also expect to see, within that mix, stronger sales and marketing growth as we get to new launches in the second part of the year, and R&D continue to scale and grow from what we've seen thus far. So those are the dynamics we see here on operating margin for 2024.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Gordon. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. My question is regarding the rest of the world sales for incretins. It seems like Mounjaro is doing quite well there, and if I take out the 15% or so for stocking in the US, it seems like ex-US is already about 33% this early in the launch. So I would love to understand how has been your experience so far, and is there going to be any different uptake for ex-US versus your prior generation incretins for both Mounjaro and Zepbound, given that these are really efficacious drugs?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Ilya, do you want to comment on OUS rollout for Mounjaro?\n\nIlya Yuffa\n\nPresident of Lilly International, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. We've seen some great progress with the launch of Mounjaro outside of the US. I think what you've seen in terms of growth in the earlier launch countries such as the UK, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, UAE and Saudi Arabia are both key markets that make up the rest of the world, have already achieved a leading share and continue to drive momentum and overall market growth.\nAnd so as you take a look at Q2, the main driver of that growth has been in Mounjaro in markets where we've already launched earlier in the cycle, and majority of that coming from the KwikPen presentation with a lot of that in the UAE. Some of that is channel dynamics similar to the US.\nAt the same time, if you take a look at Q2 and the trajectory for Q2 relative to kind of historical peak sales of any of our brands, it's already surpassed that with a limited number of markets where we've launched. So as we look at the coming quarters, obviously, we just recently launched in Germany and now also Spain with the KwikPen presentation. We'll also look to monitor the demand and also supply capacity and expect to launch in newer markets. The near-term growth, I would expect predominantly coming from already launched markets of Mounjaro.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Ilya. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Alex Hammond from Bank of America. Alex, your line is live.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nVP of Equity Research in Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking the question. In the prepared remarks, Dan mentioned engagement with regulatory authorities on a potential pivotal trial for MASH. Can you provide any color on these discussions and how Lilly is thinking about tirzepatide versus retatrutide for this indication? When could we receive updates? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDan?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about the opportunity to help patients suffering from MASH. I think the data that we shared in phase II for tirzepatide is really quite profound in terms of the size of effect we can have. There's a couple of issues in MASH drug development that we're trying to tackle, probably the most significant of which is the current standard of liver biopsy to identify the patients to enroll in these trials and also to measure the outcome.\nLiver biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure and difficult to find patients to consent to these trials, and of course, there's risk to patients. We're working hard to develop non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to identify the right patients to enroll in MASH studies and also potentially could be used as an outcome to know if a drug's working.\nMy hope is that we could develop those kinds of biomarkers that could be used for both purposes and could be suitable for accelerated approval of MASH drugs in the future. Of course, long-term traditional approval for MASH drugs still requires demonstration of outcomes. So in that environment, we have two drugs that I think could both be great MASH drugs, and we'll have to decide whether to invest in one or both of those drugs depending on the regulatory paths we see. We'll keep investors updated as we make decisions about the future of these molecules and MASH.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Capita\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, and Senior Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Analyst\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on manufacturing and specifically on the concern that you raised back in February around the proposed acquisition of Catalent by Novo Holdings and the subsequent sale to Novo Nordisk. Are you still as concerned as you were in February, or given what you've been able to do with your own footprint, is this less of an issue? Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. I can take it. We remain concerned about that transaction. I don't think it was ever really about the trajectory of our ramp, although, as we've disclosed, we do rely on one of the Catalent sites for GLP-1 and other diabetes production. It's more the oddity of your main competitor being also your contract manufacturer and how to resolve that situation. There's also an industry structure issue. CDMOs are important for managing capacity across the sector.\nAnd if we ended up in an outcome where that sector didn't really exist, maybe all became captive of large pharma, it would really constrain, I think, availability in the development of medicines, particularly out of biotechs. So we've aired those concerns publicly and privately since the proposed transaction was announced, and we're waiting to see what happens.\nBut in terms of the long-term outlook for our company, as you may have noticed, we're building aggressively ourselves. Our primary strategy is self-run sites, and we've got $18 billion we've announced in the last several years, probably not done there. We're quite comfortable building and operating sites, and as the newest large sites have begun to come online, we know we can execute that drill and repeat it, and that's our base plan.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan, for the question. Paul, next.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David, your line is live.\n\nDavid Risinger",
    "content2": "Senior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks so much. And let me add my congrats on the results as well and the corporate updates. So Zepbound's breadth of health and worker productivity benefits seem to be underappreciated by many. There are articles from time to time that say that patients need an off-ramp from therapy, etc. And my question is, what is Lilly doing to encourage patients to stay persistent with therapy, and how does Lilly intend to better communicate not just Zepbound's health benefits, but its worker productivity benefits to employers in order to drive much greater employer inclusion of obesity drugs as part of employee benefits? Thanks very much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Patrik, do you want to comment on persistency and benefits?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAbsolutely. I think first of all, when we look at persistency, it's very early after the launch, but based upon the feedback we hear from providers and from patients as well, this is a drug that patients want to stay on because they experience the benefits firsthand of weight loss and also the downstream implications on comorbidities. You're right. The employer opt-in efforts are extremely key, and we believe that our outcome data, OSA and HFpEF, will help us tremendously, and more readouts to come over the coming years.\nWe're also having value-based agreements with several of the payers where we are looking into the benefits of tirzepatide in the workplace in terms of reduced absenteeism, increased productivity, etc., as well, and that has gained a lot of interest. In terms of the consumer, yes, the easy start and stay on is a key priority for us.\nAnd there, we're working with consumers, improving our consumer platforms, and also digital channels to really enable patients to experience the benefits that Zepbound provides over time.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrick. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you for taking my question. Just going back to the margin question earlier, given you're now expecting your 2024 rating.\n\nOperator\n\nApologies, team. We will get Kerry reconnected with a better line momentarily. We will move on to the next question in the meantime, if that's okay, from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nChris, your line is live.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Thank you. With all the different oral mechanisms, in particular, variations on it from yourselves as well as competitors, can you update us on your thinking on what the basis of competition is going to be and what kind of opportunities do you really envision? I think there has been for a while now a comparison on the basis of percent weight loss, particularly for the injectables. But as we move into orals, it seems as if tolerability profiles really matter.\nSo how are you thinking about it, and how do you recommend investors think when we compare data sets across these other oral products in development? Even if the mechanisms are different, how do we get smarter about differentiating and interpreting data? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAnyone want to chime in?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. I'll start, and then we'll see if Patrik has anything to add on commercial differentiation. But in the clinical trials, I think, first of all, as I was saying before, just take some caution on these small, short phase I trials. There's more to see. Most of the drugs that we've seen actually are different mechanisms. They're GLP-1 agonists. And in this class, I don't expect there to be differentiation in terms of efficacy, weight loss.\nYou can pretty much dial in the amount of weight loss you want depending on how aggressively you dose it and what population. Tolerability is another issue that usually comes along with the efficacy. The faster you ramp to higher doses, the less tolerability you have. And the different companies will have to work through their own escalation of dosing to match the desired efficacy with some reasonable tolerability.\nThe variable that links those two things together is often the half-life of the molecule. So shorter half-life molecules will give you bigger peak trough excursions in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. And we think that's what drives the tolerability issues. So what you want is a long half-life molecule that can be dose-escalated more smoothly. So that probably will be the differentiation rather than anything that companies are currently talking about in terms of efficacy.\nAs I said before, it's a long road from early data to phase III clinical trials like we have with orforglipron, and we can expect some attrition. I'm pretty excited also about next-generation molecules. All these ones that we've been talking about now are GLP-1s and offer efficacy sort of in the range of injectable semaglutide.\nI think ultimately we'd like to see drugs that offer efficacy and tolerability that exceeds that, things that could combine multiple ingredients like tirzepatide does. And we are certainly working on orals that could also agonize GLP-1, for example. So exciting progress there and more to come on that in the future from us.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nPresident of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nJust from a commercial point of view, we are regularly conducting both consumer and provider market research. And when we look into the preferences, the true drivers today are still the degree of weight loss, safety, and tolerability. And when we look at the needs beyond that, it's actually the need of an oral and an oral with an injectable-like efficacy.\nSo that's probably the need that comes beyond what we're currently serving today, and particularly to serve those patients that have the fear of injections. When we look at other aspects, I think what comes beyond that would be the composition of weight loss, lean mass versus fat, and durability. And I think we're looking into all of those aspects as well.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Thanks for the answers. Paul, next question. I know we're running short on time, so we'll do our best to kind of compress our answers as we get through as many questions as possible. Paul?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we have Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nLovely. Thank you for taking my question. Hopefully, you can hear me better this time around.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMuch better.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nLovely. My question was on margins. So given you are now landing, expecting to land in that mid to high 30s range this year, so soon after tirzepatide launches, where can we expect your midterm operating margin to land? Is a margin in the mid 40s, perhaps higher, achievable? And Dave, I know you've previously suggested that an operating margin above 40% is not sustainable for an innovation-focused company. But given your progress so far, I wonder if you've changed your view on that. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGordon, do you want to touch on that briefly?\n\nGordon Brooks\n\nInterim CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWill do. Thanks, Kerry. Appreciate the question. Yeah. I think, as we said, like Ivan says, I said earlier, we do expect to end in that upper 30s range this year. There's still a lot at play here. Yes, on the top line, we see inflection points on revenue, but through the first half, you've had an inflated position. We haven't yet leaned into any of our promotional channels. That's going to be a dynamic that we lean into more starting in the second half. And R&D, we do intend to scale that, and that's not going quarter by quarter exactly in line with revenue.\nSo all of those things are still going to play through. I think that said, at this point, we're just talking about 2024, and when we do guidance for 2025, we'll chat about the longer-term picture then.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Next question, Paul?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Akash Tiwari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. So we're starting to see that myostatin may not be the only way to kind of preserve lean muscle mass. In particular, it looks like amylin GIP GLP combos are showing the potential for maybe 90% versus 10% fat versus muscle loss. Can you talk about what you think an eloralintide tirzepatide combo could show, both in terms of absolute weight loss, but also the quality of that weight loss? And then where would myostatin fit in a world where next-gen amylin triplets could show that level of muscle preservation? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Dan can focus on that first question about eloralintide.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. So we have multiple mechanisms in play here. Starting maybe with the amylin, we have a molecule in phase II called eloralintide, which is a pure amylin agonist, and we're evaluating that both as monotherapy and in combination with tirzepatide, GIP, GLP. So that'll be interesting to see. I don't have strong preconceived notions about what to expect in terms of lean versus fat mass loss with that particular combination. Probably the people who have the most data about that would be the scientists at Novo since they've investigated cagrilintide in combination with semaglutide.\nI think that brings us probably to another mechanism, which is dual amylin calcitonin agonism, which cagrilintide probably is a dual agonist, and we have a molecule like that in phase I called DACRAs, and we'll also investigate that.\nComposition of body mass will be one of the aspects in which we evaluate it. Then finally, you talk of myostatin. We have a molecule in this family, and that's the bimagrumab that we acquired from Versanis, which is an antibody against the receptor, and that's proceeding in a phase II trial in combination with semaglutide. We look forward to having data to share with that in the future. All of these mechanisms, I think, could have variable effects on body mass composition, but I point out that so far, we've not seen any disadvantages to the types of weight loss that we get with tirzepatide.\nIn fact, patients show improved functional outcomes on a variety of things, including improved function in heart failure as we just demonstrated. So could we have further improvements with even more higher ratio of fat to lean mass? That's the question these trials will answer.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just following on from the previous question on ex-US GLP-1, you saw Mounjaro ex-US sales this quarter jump to $677 million from $286 million. Can you give us some color on how ex-US reimbursement is going with the bigger countries, and is this more of an out-of-pocket drug in these countries, and what percentage of the $677 million is obesity sales versus diabetes? Thanks very much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. On that second one, I don't think we'll probably give much of a good answer on that. So I'll maybe ask Ilya to weigh in just on that first question around how ex-US reimbursement is going.\n\nIlya Yuffa\n\nPresident of Lilly International, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Well, first, I think the momentum overall is progressing quite nicely in both the reimbursed as well as the out-of-pocket segments. We have achieved reimbursement in the UK. We have reimbursement in Germany, and we're continuing to look for reimbursement and expand reimbursement in other markets that we've launched. We have some reimbursement in UAE and Saudi as well in type II diabetes, and we continue to expand on that in the markets that we will enter.\nBut a lot of that momentum is covering both the type II and chronic weight management market and both in the reimbursed and out-of-pocket segment. And we're seeing both the progress in share as well as market expansion in the markets that we've been in.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Ilya. Paul, I know we have a lot in the queue. Maybe we'll just have two more questions and then wrap things up.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. The next question is coming from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you so much. The FDA definition of shortage seems clear, and tirzepatide no longer meeting the definition of shortage seems to imply Lilly is meeting demand. I assume you will say that that's not the case, but the definition, at least in black and white, is quite clear. I assume this is FDA's determination. So does Lilly agree with FDA's conclusion? How is demand being met? How is demand being measured, and what does demand look like? Thank you.\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the important question. As we think about the compounding question, it's important as well. As we've said earlier, we're available in all dosage forms in the US. What that means is, as you know, we can fill orders as they're received is what we're doing. That does not mean that any pharmacy, or certainly every pharmacy, has all 12 dosage forms sitting on their shelf. That's infeasible economically, probably for a lot of them, and even logistically.\nSo I think we'll continue to see, because there's not an abundance of supply, it's more of a real-time fulfillment situation, patients going to pharmacy counters and being told to wait a few days while their order's filled. But product is flowing, and it's flowing at a pretty high rate. We're shipping quite a bit, and you can see that in these results from the quarter.\nSo, fills will add to that picture, but demand will increase as well. So I think we're doing well given the situation, but the in-pharmacy experience will continue to be choppy. We point that out to the FDA, so that means people may call and say, \"I couldn't get what I wanted at the moment I wanted it at the pharmacy I chose to.\" That's not the definition that we think applies here. So we'll continue to work with channel partners and the agency to try to clear up the confusion and improve the consumer experience, which is our responsibility along with theirs.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Paul, last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question today will be from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how excited you are about these muscle-preserving obesity drugs and if you see that as a true unmet need. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Dan, anything to add on?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. No, thanks for the question, Louise. I think it's an interesting area of science for sure. Too soon to know exactly how these kinds of mechanisms will translate into benefits for patients. At a high level, we know that the ratio of lean mass to fat mass is really important in determining metabolic health, probably more important as an indicator of overall metabolic health than, for example, BMI. And so that's what spurs these kinds of efforts to increase lean mass while causing fat mass loss. And we'll wait to see data from our own bimagrumab and wait to see how that translates into health benefits for patients.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. So I think we'll wrap up. Dave, closing remarks?\n\nDavid Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Joe. And thanks to the team here. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please follow up with the investor relations team if you have any questions we didn't address, and it sounds like there's a few that we're holding. Happy to answer all of those.

Should you request operator assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO, Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience, Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly International, Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly, and Patrick Johnson, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springneather, and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide two.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Joe. We're pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum in our business, which positions us well for accelerated growth as this year progresses. Our focus is to bring innovative medicines to people in need. In 2024, we're investing in our people, our launches, expanding our pipeline of new medicines, including through business development, and, of course, accelerating the needed capacity in our manufacturing network. Results this quarter represent a continuation of the strong growth we delivered in 2023. On slide four, you can see details of the financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 26% in Q1, with our new products growing nearly $1.8 billion compared with the same period last year.\nWe achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase 2 results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the U.S. and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the U.S. for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and the initiation of our Phase 3 study for lepodisiran, evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk. Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany.\nIn existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand. The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets, while we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States. We continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter. On slide five, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. Now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix, and to a lesser extent, improved production costs. Marketing, sales, and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches, as well as increased compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research, as well as a one-time charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio ProStay program. In Q1, we recognized the acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10.\nOperating income increased 63% in Q1, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9%, compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023, driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods. On slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 28% in Q1, driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro, and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the U.S. increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro excess and savings card dynamics.\nMoving to Europe, revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro, as well as payments associated with distribution and investment agreements. Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity and a partnership milestone in the base period. Price declined 5% in the quarter. Moving to China, Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant and Cialis. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and, to a lesser extent, Verzenio and Jardiance. Slide eight provides additional perspective across our product categories.\nFirst, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increase 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase 3 trials read out. Next, in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally and $1.5 billion in the U.S., up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the U.S. was impacted by a one-time benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023, as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 amid strong demand.\nAccess level across commercial and R&D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines. The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. In each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties getting their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in H2 2024, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year. The production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in H2 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the saleable doses in H2 2023.\nIn the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship. Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks. In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30%, driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to healthcare professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity.\nTurning to slide nine, we have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound, with over $500 million in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S. As of 1 April 2024, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access in this market is a two-step process, typically requiring individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access both with PBMs and through employer opt-ins, and early progress is encouraging. On slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation. Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance.\nGiven the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full-year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom ends of the range to be between $42.4 billion-$43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound, and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024. With this update, year-over-year revenue growth for the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint, or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures.\nGiven the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32%-34% on a reported basis and 33-35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense and tax rates, which now takes into consideration Q1 results. Based on these updates and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.0-$13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50-$14.00 on a non-GAAP basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month. That was positive Phase 3 results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesity and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications, contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and even type 2 diabetes. The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S., with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70% of people with OSA, also live with obesity. While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease.\nAs shown on slide 12, SURMOUNT OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study one evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy, while study two evaluated tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least three months prior to the study and planned to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. The total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which could be 10 mg or 15 mg, or to placebo, and patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks. On slide 13, we show the results of study one.\nFor the efficacy estimate on mean apnea-hypopnea index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9, and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body weight reduction of 18.1% with tirzepatide treatment, consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo. On slide 14, we show the results of study two. In this population, for the efficacy estimate, tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1 in the tirzepatide arm, and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%.\nAgain, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body weight reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant. In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see, given several factors that were uniquely combined in this study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there was a particularly high baseline BMI in this population.\nFinally, the use of the 10 or 15 milligram maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20%, despite this difficult-to-treat population. Consistent with other Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT OSA during a symposium at ADA on 21 June. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear. Moving to the other updates across our portfolio, slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of 26 April, and slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in Q4, the first Phase 3 study of insulin efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin.\nThis study evaluated efsitora alfa compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top-line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT-2, which is evaluating efsitora alfa compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin. Together, these are the first two of five studies in the efsitora alfa Phase 3 program. Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time to first hospitalization due to heart failure or all-cause mortality versus placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. We've completed enrollment for SURMOUNT-MMO with over 15,000 participants and for both orforglipron studies in chronic weight management, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, which together enrolled 4,500 participants.\nFinally, we've now initiated the TRANSCEND Phase 3 program studying retatrutide in type 2 diabetes. In the cardiovascular disease area, we're excited to have initiated the Phase 3 trial for lepodisiran, the subcutaneous injectable siRNA. This study will evaluate the efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes for participants with high lipoprotein(a) who have cardiovascular disease or are at a risk of heart attack or stroke. We are evaluating the efficacy of lepodisiran in both secondary and high-risk primary prevention, and we hope this will one day offer healthcare providers a treatment option for a broad group of patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high LPA levels. Earlier in our diabetes and obesity pipeline, we've now initiated a Phase 2 monotherapy study evaluating eloralintide, our selective amylin receptor agonist in obesity.\nTurning to oncology, we made the decision to terminate for futility the Phase 3 CYCLONE-3 trial evaluating Verzenio in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer following an interim analysis. This concludes development of Verzenio in prostate cancer following last quarter's announcement that the CYCLONE-2 study did not meet its primary endpoint. In early oncology development, we've initiated Phase 1 trials for two new assets. The first is our Nectin-4 ADC, which came from our acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics. The second is PNT2001, which came from our acquisition of Point Biopharma. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our oncology portfolio and expect 2024 to be particularly productive. Along with the Nectin-4 ADC and PNT2001 start, we expect at least three other new molecules to enter the clinic this year.\nWe look forward to sharing more details with the investment community at an oncology-focused investor event hosted by the Lilly Oncology team. This event will take place on the evening of Sunday, 2 June, in Chicago in conjunction with the ASCO annual meeting, but will also be available via webcast. We plan to provide an update on our oncology strategy and pipeline opportunities. Additional details will be available soon regarding this event. Turning to neuroscience, last month we announced that the FDA plans to convene a meeting of the Peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We expect the advisory committee meeting will take place in mid-2024, but the exact date will be confirmed when it appears in the Federal Register. We expect the focus to be around the safety and efficacy profile of donanemab, along with unique aspects of the clinical program.\nWe remain confident in donanemab's potential to offer very meaningful benefits to patients and look forward to addressing the FDA's questions in this forum. Additionally, we made the decision to discontinue investigation of GBA-1, our gene therapy asset in Gaucher disease type 2. Phase 2 studies in Parkinson's disease and Gaucher disease type 1 are still underway and have not been impacted by this decision. Finally, in immunology, we've submitted mirikizumab to the FDA and EMA for approval for use in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In the U.S., we've resubmitted lebrikizumab's application to the FDA for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This is following a complete response letter based on inspection findings at a third-party manufacturer. As a reminder, the letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, safety, or label. We expect regulatory action in the second half of this year.\nWe're also announcing that in the coming months, we'll be initiating Phase 3 studies evaluating lebrikizumab in two new indications: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and allergic rhinitis due to perennial allergens. Lebrikizumab will be the first biologic to be evaluated in Phase 3 for allergic rhinitis. We're optimistic about the potential of lebrikizumab to be an important treatment option in these patient populations, as well as in atopic dermatitis. In earlier stage immunology development, we've advanced our CD19 antibody into Phase 2 for multiple sclerosis. I now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress in our first quarter. Strong revenue growth in Q1 was driven by our recent product launches, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. We expect acceleration in revenue growth through the second half of the year as supply of incretin medicines continues to ramp. Significant advances in our pipeline include top-line data from tirzepatide and SURMOUNT OSA, approval of the QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro in the EU, submission of mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, as well as an initiation of lebrikizumab Phase 3 study as Dan just mentioned. We are continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, internal and external pipeline development, and our manufacturing expansion agenda. This is to sustain our long-term growth outlook. So now let me turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and to conclude our call in a timely manner. So consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller, so ask that you limit to one question per caller as we'll end the call at 11:00AM. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for our first caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we pull for questions. The first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, and congrats on all the progress here. I just had a question, just was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the capacity dynamics that are leading to the guidance raised today. I specifically was just looking for a little more color on is this more U.S. or international, and should we read this as more capacity in the system than you expected, or just a faster ramp of the new plant and maybe the same overall capacity as you exit the year? Thanks so much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Anat to talk about the guidance raise.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Chris. And as we've mentioned earlier in the year when we issued guidance, we said that we expect capacity and supply to ramp towards the second half of the year, and that's what we're seeing. Now, as a reminder, we do have quite a large number of nodes across our supply chain that have to come online or ramp capacity. If you look at everything we have under construction or ramping up, we have six sites right now between the two sites in North Carolina, a site in Ireland, two sites in Indiana, a site in Germany, and then a seventh one that we just purchased. They're all either ramping up or under construction.\nThere are multiple nodes across that supply chain that have to become operational, which requires approval, etc., for three products, depending on which product runs on which line that are planned throughout the year. Now that we're four months into the year, we have greater visibility into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident. Just as one example, the approval of the QuickPen in Europe that just came in, slightly ahead of our expectation, gives us additional confidence in our ability to launch QuickPen for patients in Europe. So it is across our sites globally, as well as ramping up capacity with partners, our CDMOs, as well as in existing sites where we're making investments to expand where we can or ramp up capacity. So it's across our supply chain.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Next caller, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. I have a question regarding the pricing. If you look at the script trend, it seems like there was a little bit of adverse relationship in the pricing versus fourth quarter. Can you comment on that, and how should we think about the cadence of price volume over the quarters for the year? Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mohit. You didn't say it, but I assume you're talking about Mounjaro and Zepbound, so I'll hand over to Patrick to make some commentary on that price.\n\nPatrick Johnson\n\nPresident, Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you very much, Mohit. When you look at the pricing of Mounjaro, I think it's important to take into account that in the Q4 earnings, we announced a one-time adjustment for Mounjaro in Q4 that was quite significant. So that was a one-time adjustment in the base of Q4. When we look forward for H1 2024, it's important to have in mind that we also terminated the $25 savings card 30 June 2023, but patients that were on are grandfathered until 30 June 2024. So that will probably be some benefit during H1 2024 for Mounjaro, but from H2 2024, we should expect to see typical pricing headwinds for Mounjaro as well.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Next question, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is live.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus a quick second on Part D reimbursement dynamics, if I may. And my question is, will tirzepatide be considered differently than a \"weight loss drug\" to secure Part D reimbursement? And the new indications like sleep apnea, will they be considered an applicable drug and not get lumped up as a broad \"weight loss drug\"? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Umer. I'll go to Patrick for that question.\n\nPatrick Johnson\n\nPresident, Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you very much, Umer. I think with the announcement made by the CMS early April to reimburse comorbidities for obesity based upon the SELECT trial, we're also confident that with the new data that we presented just weeks ago in terms of obstructive sleep apnea, that that's going to be reimbursed in Medicare Part D. And we expect similarly for other comorbidities and readout of HFpEF assuming that's positive and approved, and later on with the morbidity and mortality outcome study. Still, our true north is really to get through our Treat and Reduce Obesity Act cost. And we strongly believe that's not a matter of if, but when. We don't see it likely to pass in 2024, but there is still a small likelihood that that's going to happen.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrick. Next question, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. So really just wanted to ask, Dan, as you have assessed the Phase 2 SURMOUNT data in NASH, just interested to know how you are thinking about those data and the opportunity for tirzepatide in that setting, or perhaps if retatrutide remains the right target molecule to move forward there. We've had a lot of speculation around some of the comments from the last quarter and just trying to firm that up and also when we're likely to see those data. I believe they're expected to EASL, but if that is possible to confirm, thanks so much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDan?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Seamus. I'll start with the last part there. Yeah, the abstract was accepted and will be presented at EASL in early June. So that'll be the opportunity to see the full NASH package from that Phase 2 trial. Like we said in the last call, really exciting data. We shared some of the top line. I think tirzepatide can have a profound effect on this disease. It's a Phase 2 trial. Next steps here are to discuss with the FDA what the best path forward could be for tirzepatide. You're pointing out, though, that we have another choice in retatrutide, which, based on biomarker data from earlier studies, could also have a profound effect on this disease. That molecule has the addition of glucagon, which is likely to have additional benefits in the liver.\nImportant opportunities ahead and good to have options as we go into these discussions with regulators. I think for NASH, like other obesity-related or metabolic-related diseases, LILY has a pretty broad portfolio, and we'll just continue to push the science to make the best possible medicines for patients.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. You showed a slide that Zepbound has NBRX market share of 57% at end of Q1. That makes it pretty clear that the strongest drug wins. So on that topic, just your latest thinking on upcoming competitor readouts and how they'll stack up to that Zepbound on metrics of weight loss and blood sugar, so specifically CagriSema from Novo and Amgen's 133. I know it's just the best guess, but it's what we get asked to do thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Okay. I'll maybe hand it to Dan for some comments.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure, Tim. It's probably more your job than ours to speculate on competitor readouts, but I'll take a stab at it since it's yes. I think on AMG 133, we've just seen really a small amount of data, so probably anything is possible. And like you, we'll be interested to see their results. Of course, there's arguments that can be heard about GIP agonism versus antagonism. We've placed our bets, and we like the data we got with GIP agonism. On CagriSema, of course, adding more agonism on different pathways on top of GLP-1 is a good idea. That's what we have with tirzepatide as a dual agonist. So CagriSema makes sense, and you'll note that we've advanced our amylin agonist into Phase 2. Tirzepatide already is a dual agonist. Retatrutide's already a triple agonist. There's probably more we could do here at Lilly.\nI think across our portfolio in Phase one and Phase two, we have nine assets that are marked for diabetes or obesity. Many of them could lead to additive weight loss on top of established mechanisms, plus two more in Phase three, of course. So we have a strong portfolio here. I think Tirzepatide still has unsurpassed efficacy at weight loss, but we're preparing for our next generation assets as well.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks again, Tim. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Congrats on all the progress. Just was wondering if you can tell us if the IQVIA prescription data is an accurate representation of Tirzepatide volumes or if it's been underrepresented at all given Lilly Direct and what you know about how much is flowing through that channel. And if it is underrepresented, can you help quantify any delta for us? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Terence. I'll hand it to Patrick for commentary on IQVIA via Lilly Direct.\n\nPatrick Johnson\n\nPresident, Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWell, thanks very much, Terence. When it comes to Lilly Direct, I think we're very pleased with the start. When we look at the utilization by consumers, it's gaining traction by weeks here. If we look at the TRx data of Q1, particularly for Zepbound, it's relatively low volume that goes through Lilly Direct, slightly higher in terms of NBRx. It's our understanding that what goes through Lilly Direct is not by default captured by IQVIA, but IQVIA has a methodology in place to estimate what goes through Lilly Direct as well.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Patrick. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. So your team presented data on a monotherapy GIP agonist at ADA last year, but it looks like you are moving the amylin into Phase 2. Can you talk about why amylin might be preferred versus GIP as a maintenance regimen for obesity and how your products could differ versus others when it comes to half-life and preferential agonism versus calcitonin and amylin? Thanks.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Akash. I'll hand it to Dan for commentary on our amylin.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, yeah. There are a lot of good questions in there. Thanks for following the science so closely. So on the GIP, the long-acting molecule, I think primarily in that experiment, we were excited to show the benefits of isolated GIP agonism just to answer some mechanism of action questions around tirzepatide. But as you point out, there's potential for that molecule for other indications or as a monotherapy or combination with other mechanisms. But of course, since tirzepatide already includes GIP agonism, we're also excited to explore other mechanisms. So that's where the LARA, which is one of nine different mechanisms, as I said a moment ago, that we're exploring the long-acting amylin, move forward to Phase 2. That has potential perhaps as a combination therapy, perhaps as a maintenance therapy, perhaps as a monotherapy. There's a lot to explore.\nIt's still very early as it is for all of our mechanisms. So we'll keep investing, and as we have data to share, we'll do that.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks for my question. Just back on CMS recently broadening its coverage for Wegovy for certain heart conditions. I appreciate you mentioned that TROA is the main goal, but do you expect Zepbound to get added to CMS in a similar way as Wegovy? And yeah, when could this happen? Could this be after the heart failure data in Q3, or do we have to wait for the CVOT data? Thanks very much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Trung. Let Patrick respond.\n\nPatrick Johnson\n\nPresident, Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tom. Based upon what CMS stated early April, we actually expect to get obstructive sleep apnea for Zepbound covered by CMS and Medicare at the time of launch. And the next one then would be HFpEF assuming a positive readout and approval. And the third one would be the MMO indication. That's the sequence of our plans assuming everything goes according to plan and we get the approval for both.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrick. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Jeff, your line is live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for the question. You guys have been asked on this before, I'm sure, but can you just review the rationale and utilizing the QuickPen just for outside the U.S. markets like Europe? I wasn't sure why this couldn't apply to the U.S. market and if this also could be a means to relieve capacity looking forward. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Geoff, for the question. Paul, Dave, you want to weigh in?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, sure. And Lilly, I can add to this. As we think it, we've said on several calls now, our goal is to pursue all of the above, basically as it relates to supply options, recognizing the tremendous demand, unmet need, and the constraints that exist in scaling the supply chain. So QuickPen uses existing assets, so there was less time lag. We should do this first in the U.K. and now in Europe as a way to meet the needs of those patients. But we haven't ruled it out in other jurisdictions. And so we'll continue to look at every option we can to meet the needs of patients with obesity and overweight as well as with diabetes.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Carrie Halford from Berenberg. Carrie, your line is live.\n\n[Analyst] (Berenberg)\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nOh, hi. I'm going to take a different topic here. Looking at Lp(a), your new product you've now said that you're taking into Phase 3. Can you confirm whether you've published any Phase 2 data? I haven't found any. So if I'm correct there, when might we see that published? And can you confirm what dose and frequency of administration you're looking at for that Phase 3 study? And I guess as you appear to be positioned third in that race, we'd be interested to hear how you expect your drug to be differentiated versus a competitor as it's already in Phase 3. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Carrie. It's a good multi-part question, but on Lp(a), happy to talk about Lepodisiran. So Dan, do you want to comment on this?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Carrie, for the good questions here. You're right. We haven't yet published the Phase 2 data. I think we just recently were able to publish the Phase 1 data. That was really exciting and well received. I think one of the things that people noted in our Phase 1 data was a very long durability of action and the very deep reduction in Lp(a) levels following a single dose of lepodisiran. We now have, of course, Phase 2 data in hand and use that to design and begin the Phase 3 trial. I think we haven't quite disclosed dose or frequency yet, but I'm sure that will happen in time. You asked about differentiation. I think there's probably a couple of different potentials for differentiation here versus a shorter-acting ASO and a siRNA that are both in Phase 3 studies.\nMaybe first is the depth of clearance of Lp(a). We don't know how much you have to reduce Lp(a) to lead to benefits and cardiovascular outcomes, and whether there's a threshold effect or a floor to this. So the depth of clearance is one. The second, as you asked about, could be frequency of administration or durability of action, those two being closely linked. And the third, of course, is the population that's being studied. I noted we're studying secondary as well as primary prevention here. So I think we have a good package with multiple opportunities for differentiation, and eager to test the Lp(a) hypothesis here in this Phase 3 study.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks for the question, Carrie. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you very much. Given that based on all available metrics, the SURPASS-CVOT interim likely already has passed, can you confirm that the only way the trial would have stopped is if there were either a survival benefit or futility, and not simply non-inferiority? And anything you can say regarding your confidence in eventually hitting superiority based on what you know so far? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Dan, do you want to take a question on SURPASS-CVOT?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Thanks, Steve. As you know, we do our best not to comment on interim analyses, although many of our different trials can incorporate interim analyses. But when we do talk about them, it risks unintentional unblinding of results. And for that reason, we prefer not to do that. You're right that the primary analysis of the study and the design was around non-inferiority versus what we already know to be a very good drug that reduces cardiovascular risk, and that's Trulicity. So it's designed as a non-inferiority trial. Of course, when the final data come, we would be delighted to see even superiority. You asked about our confidence. Confidence continues to increase for this readout.\nIn fact, as disclosed in the prepared remarks today, we got additional data here even from the OSA study that should make us feel more confident, not just the benefit in sleep apnea, which itself could lead to cardiovascular benefits, but actually the weight loss. I think there are some concerns about weight loss in different populations and different trials and males, females, etc. Some of that was discharged here. Remain excited and look forward to getting that data when the study is complete.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the donanemab with the adcom approaching. Can you discuss if your confidence has changed in the asset and maybe any specific points that you hope will be addressed during this discussion with these outside experts? Thank you so much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan. Anne, you want to discuss it on adcom?\n\nAnne White\n\nPresident, Lilly Neuroscience, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks so much for the question. We are incredibly confident in Donanemab's potential and the fact that it offers very meaningful benefits to people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and just the overall approvability of the package. We do look forward to seeing those questions. We haven't received those yet. I think that what we'll anticipate really is discussions around the safety and efficacy of the Donanemab. The safety and efficacy profile remain very consistent with what we published and presented. So nothing new there. We do expect there's a couple of unique aspects to our trial that we anticipate they'll want to discuss. One is around limited duration dosing. We think this is an incredibly important feature of the Donanemab, the chance to stop dosing when you've cleared the plaques. The Donanemab clears them robustly and rapidly.\nSo we think that allows for this limited duration dosing approach. So we really do look forward to getting into that data and having the advisors see that and respond to it. Another unique aspect is assessing tau at baseline. This is important for the field so that we understand the prognostic factor of tau, and that was able to be confirmed. But what we saw in the trial was all patients benefited regardless of tau level, with those earlier in the disease doing even better. It's one of the reasons that we remain so enthusiastic about TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3. And while Dan didn't mention that in his remarks, I think we remain even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to intervene earlier based on what we saw in that early population, the people with low tau, and those that had no tau with such strong biomarker results.\nI think you probably remember the data that patients in the earliest part of our study had a 60% slowing. And we believe that could be even stronger as you get into the earlier patients that are pre-clinical. But maybe just one remark. In the meantime, though, this is not time lost. We'll continue to make sure the healthcare system is ready. We're going to make sure that we launch into an even stronger market with potential approval. So we're making the most of this time and look forward to the adcom, as Dan said, in mid-2024 and answering any questions that they have.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Ann. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David, your line is live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much. And let me add my congrats on the progress and the guidance raised. So my question is on orforglipron. Novo Nordisk has raised some concerns about the scalability of orforglipron manufacturing given its complexity. I haven't spoken to Novo directly, but someone told me that they mentioned there are 35 steps in the process. I don't know if that's true, but could you please discuss how Lilly is building out its manufacturing capacity and whether the company expects to be able to meet global demand in the Western world after launch in 2026, or whether we, the investment community, should expect supply constraints and should be guarded about how we try to model orforglipron's ramp after launch? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. I'll hand over to our Dave Ricks here.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Okay. Great, Dave. Great to hear from you. I mean, first of all, it is true that Orforglipron is a complicated, large small molecule, a large small molecule, if you will. And there are many steps in the process. You can read about them in our patent filings, I think. But Lilly, maybe unlike other companies, we've made small molecules for a long time. We're capable of doing it. We understand how to put them together. And we've got a defined process to do it for Orforglipron. So the API production, while a long process and maybe complicated relative to other small molecules, is something we're super confident in and have our arms around. The finished process is really the big advance over using injectables because here we're just tablet stamping or capsule making, which are dry processes we understand extremely well.\nI think the big gain here will be the fact that both for synthetic chemistry, capsule making, and tablet making, there is already capacity on planet Earth that is significant. So unlike the parenteral side where we've been talking about injectables and new capacity needs to be built, which we're doing aggressively, as Anat commented on earlier, here, there's a lot of partners we can access as well as our own substantial network for dry product, so finished and API production. Pretty confident here. Now, will we stick the landing on exact doses and quantities? In every instance, we're not guaranteeing that, but I think the picture will be quite a bit different should orforglipron prove to be safe and effective in the Phase 3 studies. Again, that's in 2025, so we can expect launch maybe a year after that.\nThat's an important event in the time course of the incretin class.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. And thanks, David Risinger for the question. Next question, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you about your next wave of obesity drugs. Looks like you've got half a dozen of these in development. And where do you think you can most differentiate yourself? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Dan, do you want to comment on earlier Phase obesity?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Louise. We're excited about the portfolio of earlier stage obesity molecules. I think there's a number of opportunities for improvement over even an excellent drug like tirzepatide. We think about the quality of weight loss as one aspect. So for example, even on tirzepatide, we see the ratio of lean to fat mass improve as patients lose weight on these drugs. Could we make it improve even faster with a muscle-stimulating agent like Bimagrumab? Maybe. That's under investigation. Tirzepatide is very well tolerated, but some people stop taking it because of GI side effects. Could we have drugs that have fewer side effects? Maybe that could be possible. Tirzepatide is given as a once-a-weekly injection. Most patients find that to be acceptable, but probably with less frequent injections, that could lower the burden on manufacturing and make it easier to use for patients.\nSo that's another avenue of exploration. There are some patients who don't achieve their desired levels of weight loss, even on a powerful drug like tirzepatide. And so that's another avenue. Finally, across different indications, and I spoke earlier of MASH that are related to metabolic disease, there could be different activities that prove more or less beneficial for these other related diseases. So that's another avenue of differentiation. I think we're just at the beginning of probably what will be seen as a multi-decade investment in treating abnormal metabolism and all diseases that come with that. And I'm really proud and pleased that Lilly has what must be the strongest pipeline in this area in the industry.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nHey, thanks, Chris. Paul, next question.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOops, can you hear me?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOh, yeah, there you are. Go ahead, Chris.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Wanted to ask about the supply-and-demand dynamic and when those two might come closer together. Previously, Anat, you've been quite specific in your vocabulary in saying that that was something that could possibly happen in 2025. Dave, you were in front of a group that we hosted, and I think you gave a little bit of a broader range. What's the latest that you would like to communicate based upon all the progress that you're making, the acquisition of the Nexus facility, etc., about a potential timing for that supply-demand dynamic to come closer together?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Anat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYep. Yeah. Let me start on this. So I would say that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that the supply-demand situation will remain quite tight in the near term as well as the midterm. And just to clarify, it's not that we have a production issue or manufacturing facilities are progressing incredibly well. And I'm incredibly proud of the work done by our M&Q colleagues around the world. Literally, we have sites working 24/7. We're doing construction overnight. We're making the right investments to ensure we're progressing rapidly, as you've seen evidenced by the results as well as the raise we did for the year. But the demand is strong, which shouldn't be a surprise given the health benefits that these products provide to patients, highly efficacious and safe medicines.\nI expect that this will continue through the year, even with the significant ramp that we have, and we'll add more supply across different presentations, both with the auto injector as well as the QuickPen. But even with that, I expect that the demand will outpace supply through this year. Potentially next year, obviously, we'll see. We're continuing to invest and ramp as we go into next year, but it could be quite some time. We talked earlier about Orforglipron. Should we have positive Phase 3 readout that provides another relief valve in terms of just offering a different presentation, as Dave mentioned, which utilizes a different set of infrastructure within our manufacturing organization and available capacity globally. So it will be in a stepwise fashion. We'll continue to update investors as we progress through the year and coming years.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will be from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on all the progress. I wanted to dive into bimagrumab ahead of the Phase 2 data forthcoming. Can you talk for a bit around the importance of showing specific or clear dose-response across the composition of the weight loss drivers, and maybe as well as the importance of not blunting the overall weight loss as you contemplate a move to Phase 3 potentially? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Carter, for the question. Dan, you want to comment on bimagrumab?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Carter. It's a good question. Bimagrumab is a very different mechanism of weight loss versus incretins, but one that we think could be important in combination with incretins. So Bimagrumab, we think will likely have important effects on adipose tissue as well as muscle mass. And so our hope is to see increased muscle mass and increased ratio, I should say, of lean to fat mass by combining Bimagrumab with incretins. In this present study, it's being evaluated both as monotherapy and combination with semaglutide at different doses. So we'll see if weight loss effects on fat tissue stack, and we'll see if effects on lean body mass that were seen in previous Bimagrumab monotherapy studies work in combination with incretins. Looking forward to seeing that data.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Kripa, your line is live.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nVP of Biotechnology Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I have a question about your radiopharma pipeline. You mentioned PNT2002 in your oncology pipeline. Can you talk about how you see that advancing, and given what you've seen so far, where you see this being placed in the landscape in terms of market share? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Kripa, for the question. Jake, I'm calling you to maybe opine a little bit on our radioligand efforts, PNT2001 in particular.\n\nJake Van Naarden\n\nEVP and President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, happy to. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of Point Biopharma. We are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves. I expect we'll have more to talk about in terms of additional medicines over the course of the next couple of years in addition to PNT2001. Specific to that question, PNT2001 is a PSMA-directed therapy for prostate cancer conjugated to actinium, the alpha emitter.\nI think while actinium holds a lot of promise over lutetium, particularly in the context of creating double-stranded DNA breaks versus single-stranded, and the ability to perhaps drive more efficacy for patients with prostate cancer, I think one of the limitations of the existing agents is that they probably cause too much salivary gland toxicity to be real durable products. So the Point team designed a novel PSMA-directed ligand with increased tumor uptake relative to the salivary gland in order to drive more therapeutic index using actinium as the payload. We're just getting started with the Phase 1 experience right now. I don't have a lot to say about what we're seeing just yet. But the preclinical package looked really interesting and differentiated from the other PSMA ligands that exist out there.\nSo we're looking forward to putting it through its Phase 1 paces, and we'll see what we have. Depending on the clinical profile, I think there's the potential to improve outcomes in patients that have already seen a lutetium-based agent, maybe go ahead of that and compete with the lutetium-based agent, so perhaps even go even earlier in therapy as PSMA expression really exists in the continuum of prostate cancer care. So more to come on that as we define the clinical profile in the Phase 1.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Jake. Paul, I think we've got time for maybe one more question. We're right at 11:00AM, so maybe final question in the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. And the final question today is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to try and reconcile the guidance list with the 1.5x scalable doses being maintained. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, James, maybe I'll give to Anat to talk about the guidance and how the guidance raise relates to the one-and-a-half scalable dose comment.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSo let's start with the one-and-a-half scalable dose comment that I made on the guidance call in February. That references not a number of devices, but a number of scalable doses. As we ramp up capacity for QuickPen, recall that unlike the single-use vial or the auto injector, QuickPen is a multi-dose device that has multiple doses available for patients. That comment referred to the second half of this year versus the second half of last year. We're expecting that total scalable doses this year in the second half will be at least one-and-a-half times where we were second half of last year. That remains unchanged. But the level of confidence we have in our ability to progress on each node of our capacity that's coming online or will get approved, etc., has just increased. There are multiple of these throughout the year.\nMultiple of these have occurred. Some will occur. I gave the QuickPen as one example. Think about a construction of a site, for example, Concord in North Carolina, which we said will become operational by the end of the year, and we'll start seeing products next year. That construction has concluded. Lines are installed, and we need to run qualifications, get approval, etc. There are multiple nodes of these across our own manufacturing sites as well as external, and they all need to come online to get to where we need in terms of the full-year guidance. But our confidence as the year progresses, and as the year has progressed, our confidence in that has increased, but it remains at least one-and-a-half.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat.\nGreat. Well, thanks for your time today, everyone, and we appreciate you participating in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. Please follow up with the IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn't address today, and have a great day. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q1 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Should you request operator assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; and Patrick Johnson, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springneather, and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.\nActual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide two. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Joe. We're pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum in our business, which positions us well for accelerated growth as this year progresses. Our focus is to bring innovative medicines to people in need.\nAnd in 2024, we're investing in our people, our launches, expanding our pipeline of new medicines, including through business development, and, of course, accelerating the needed capacity in our manufacturing network. Results this quarter represent a continuation of the strong growth we delivered in 2023. On slide four, you can see details of the financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 26% in Q1, with our new products growing nearly $1.8 billion compared with the same period last year.\nWe achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase 2 results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the US and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the US for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and the initiation of our Phase 3 study for lebrikizumab evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk. Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany.\nIn existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand. The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets. While we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States, we continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter. On slide five, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. So now, let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave.\nSlide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix, and to a lesser extent, improved production costs. Marketing, sales, and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches, as well as increased compensation and benefits costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research, as well as a one-time charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio ProStay program. In Q1, we recognized the acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10.\nOperating income increased 63% in Q1, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9%, compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023, driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods. On slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. US revenue increased 28% in Q1, driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro, and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the US increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro excess and savings card dynamics.\nMoving to Europe, revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro, as well as payments associated with the distribution and divestiture agreements. Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity, and a partnership milestone in the base period. Price declined 5% in the quarter. Moving to China, Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant, and Cialis. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and, to a lesser extent, Verzenio, and Jardiance. Slide eight provides additional perspective across our product categories.\nFirst, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increase 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase 3 trials read out. Next, in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally and $1.5 billion in the US, up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the US was impacted by a one-time benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023, as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 amid strong demand.\nAccess level across commercial and R&D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines. The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. In each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet, we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties getting their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year. The production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the saleable doses in the second half of 2023.\nIn the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship. Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose QuickPen delivery device for Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks. In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30%, driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to healthcare professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity.\nTurning to slide nine, we have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound, with over $0.5 billion in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S.. As of 1 April 2024, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access in this market is a two-step process, typically requiring individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access, both with PBMs and through employer opt-ins. Early progress is encouraging. On slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation. Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance.\nGiven the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full-year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom ends of the range to be between $42.4 billion to 43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound, and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024. With this update, year-over-year revenue growth for the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint, or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures.\nGiven the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32%-34% on a reported basis and 33%-35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense, and tax rates, which now takes into consideration Q1 results. Based on these updates and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.05-$13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50-$14.00 on a non-GAAP basis. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month.\nThat was a positive Phase 3 results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesity and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications, contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and even type 2 diabetes. The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S., with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70%, of people with OSA also live with obesity. While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease.\nAs shown on slide 12, SURMOUNT-OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study one evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy. While study two evaluated tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least three months prior to the study and planned to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. The total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which could be 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or to placebo. Patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks. On slide 13, we show the results of study one.\nFor the efficacy estimate on mean apnea-hypopnea index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9, and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body weight reduction of 18.1% with tirzepatide treatment, consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo. On slide 14, we show the results of study two. In this population, for the efficacy estimate, tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1 in the tirzepatide arm, and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%.\nAgain, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body weight reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant. In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see, given several factors that were uniquely combined in this study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there was a particularly high baseline BMI in this population.\nFinally, the use of the 10 mg or 15 mg maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20%, despite this difficult-to-treat population. Consistent with other Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT-OSA during a symposium at ADA on 21 June. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear. Moving to the other updates across our portfolio, slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of 26 April, and slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in QWINT-4, the first Phase 3 study of efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin.\nThis study evaluated efsitora alfa compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top-line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT-2, which is evaluating efsitora alfa compared to insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin. Together, these are the first two of five studies in the efsitora alfa Phase 3 program. Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint."

Should you request assistance during the call, please press star, then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of investor relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning and thank you, Paul, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2023 Earnings and 2024 guidance call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of investor relations, and joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo@Lilly; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Vice President, and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, actual results that could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide three.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAll right, thanks, Joe. 2023 was a year of advancement across our company. We grew our top line, we progressed our pipeline, advanced our external innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We continue to invest in quality, the reliability, and the resilience of our company's manufacturing infrastructure, and most importantly, delivered new, life-saving and life-changing medicines to more patients. In 2023, revenue grew 20% for the full year and 28% for the most recent quarter as our newly launched portfolio continued to gain momentum.\nThis past year, we announced positive phase 3's for donanemab, tirzepatide, mirikizumab, and pirtobrutinib. We also announced a positive phase II result for orforglipron as well as retatrutide and moved these two important molecules into phase III. In terms of external innovation, in 2023, we continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations.\nThese transactions included the acquisition of DICE Therapeutics, POINT Biopharma, Versanis Bio, Emergence Therapeutics, Mablink Biosciences, ImmunoTrack, as well as Sigilon Therapeutics. We announced several significant investments in manufacturing, including plans to expand capacity at the company's Research Triangle Park facility and the two manufacturing sites within the LEAP Innovation Park in Boone County, Indiana. Most recently, we announced plans to construct a new high-tech manufacturing site in Germany.\nThis facility will further expand the company's global injectable product and device manufacturing network, including for our diabetes and obesity portfolio. Most importantly, this past year, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2023, we received regulatory approvals for Zepbound, Jaypirca, Omvoh, Ebglyss in the US, in the EU, rather, and an expanded label for Verzenio and two new indications for Jardiance. This progress will serve as a foundation to drive top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion over time.\nAs you can see on slide four, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 28% with our new products growing by over $2 billion. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones. In addition to the Zepbound and Jaypirca CLL approvals, today we announced top-line results for the tirzepatide phase II Synergy NASH trial, as well as the Verzenio phase III Cyclone 2 trial.\nDan will talk more about these updates in his update. In terms of business development, in Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Mablink Biosciences and POINT Biopharma, the latter of which expands our capacity and capability into radioligand therapies. Lastly, we announced a 15% dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and distributed over $1 billion in dividends in the fourth quarter.\nOn slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, and other updates. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our performance was highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth driven by our new products and growth products. Q4 revenue increased 28% compared to Q4 2022.\nExcluding divestiture, this represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration in revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, and the recent launch of Zepbound. For the full year, revenue increased 20% driven by robust volume growth of 16%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 82.3%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses.\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with launches of new products and additional indications, as well as higher incentive compensation costs. R&D expenses increased 28%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research, as well as higher incentive compensation costs.\nIn Q4, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $623 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.62. In Q4 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $240 million, or $0.23 negative impact to EPS. Operating income increased 29% in Q4, driven by higher revenue from new launches, partially offset by operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 28% for the quarter and included a negative impact of approximately 7 percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 7.3% in Q4 2022.\nThe higher effective tax rate for Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2022 and the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.49 in Q4, a 19% increase compared to Q4 2022, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.62 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.23 in Q4 2022.\nOn slide eight, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. US revenue increased 39% in Q4, driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio, and Zepbound. Net price in the US increased 27% for the quarter, driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamic, as well as a one-time favorable change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the US decreased by high single digits.\nEurope continued to show strong growth in Q4, excluding $65 million in revenue associated with milestones received for the EU approval and launch of Ebglyss. Revenue was up 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. For Japan, we were pleased to see robust growth in Q4 as revenue increased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio and Mounjaro.\nMoving to China, Q4 revenue increased 7% in constant currency with volume growth of 10%, partially offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q4 was primarily driven by private investments. We were pleased to see China return to growth in 2023. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 10% in constant currency.\nHowever, when you exclude the impact of the Q4 2022 sales of rights for LIMTEN Korea and Taiwan, sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and growth product categories combined contributed approximately 15 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories.\nFirst, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 42% in Q4, driven by robust demand growth and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication, with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 30% for the quarter.\nIn the US, Jardiance revenue increased 29%, driven by increased demand. In Q4, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 14%. US revenue decreased 18%, driven by lower volume and lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays for filling orders of Trulicity. Starting in early December and going through January, all dose strengths of Trulicity were indicated as having limited availability on the FDA drug shortage site.\nWe expect to experience intermittent delays for filling orders of certain doses in the coming months. In international markets, Trulicity volume continued to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to seven, Mounjaro continued its robust growth as more type 2 diabetes patients benefited from the medicine. Q4 revenue grew to over $2.2 billion globally, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2023.\nIn the US, Mounjaro revenue of $2.1 billion in Q4, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2023, benefited from a one-time change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Adjusting for this one-time change, sequential net sales in the US would have grown approximately 30% in Q4. Since our last call, we further expanded patient access to Mounjaro. As of 1 February, access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the US was 90% in aggregate across commercial, and Part D, including 92% access for commercial patients.\nThis expanded access puts Mounjaro near parity with established injectable incretins and gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. Since the $25 non-covered copay card program expired on 30 June, we now consider all prescriptions paid.\nCompared to Q4 2022, Mounjaro net price in Q4 2023 benefited from this change to the copay card program in the US. Recall that after a change to the non-covered copay program in late 2022, patients already started on the $25 copay card could remain in the program until 30 June 2023. Today, commercially insured patients without coverage utilize the current non-covered copay program and pay roughly half the list price for Mounjaro prescription.\nTurning to slide 12, in November, we received FDA approval for Zepbound for adults with obesity or those who are overweight and have weight-related comorbidities. We then announced on 5 December 2023 that Zepbound was available at US pharmacies, and we started building commercial formulary access before the end of the year. We are pleased with the early access of approximately 1/3 of commercial lives covered as of 1 February 2024.\nAccess in this market will be more gradual as individual employers need to opt in to coverage after the typical formulary contracting takes place. We are focused on building formulary access and employer opt-ins, but we expect that it will take some time before we reach broad open access in this market.\nMeanwhile, a commercial savings card program is available at US pharmacies for those who do not yet have coverage. In Medicare Part D, weight loss drugs are still prohibited from reimbursement. In Q4, we recognized $176 million in sales for Zepbound, with approximately 3/4 of that coming from initial channel stocking. The initial prescription trends we have seen are encouraging. On slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation.\nLooking forward to 2024 and beyond, we have confidence in our existing commercial portfolio, bolstered by the recent launches of Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Zepbound, and the potential launches of donanemab and lebrikizumab, all of which we expect to serve as drivers for continued growth through the balance of the decade. On slide 14, you'll see a summary of our outlook outlining our capital deployment decisions in relation to achievement of our strategic deliverables.\nWe will invest in our current portfolio and in the future innovation through R&D, business development, and a comprehensive manufacturing expansion agenda designed to drive revenue growth and speed life-changing medicines to patients. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend increases in line with earnings growth over time and share repurchases with excess capital. Moving to slide 15, we highlight some of the dynamics that may impact our 2024 financial results.\nWe expect continued robust revenue growth with revenue from our core business, which excludes revenue from divestiture, growing nearly 30% at the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by positive momentum from recently launched products. In incretins, anticipated growth will be led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. In 2023, we made tremendous strides in expanding access from Mounjaro, and we entered 2024 with 90% of commercial and Part D lives covered.\nZepbound coverage is off to a good start since its early December launch, and we expect both Trulicity and Zepbound to contribute substantially to Lilly's revenue growth in 2024. While we expect Mounjaro and Zepbound to be drivers of revenue growth, this will be partially offset by an expected continuation of the softer Trulicity sales trends that we saw in the second half of 2023. Recent revenue declines for Trulicity in the US have been driven by supply tightness.\nVolume has also been impacted by our actions outside the US. As for supply outlook for incretins, our manufacturing organization continues to execute well on the most ambitious expansion agenda in our company's long history. Given strong demand and time required to bring capacity fully online, we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2024. In late 2022, we shared our expectation that by year-end 2023, our capacity for incretins onto injector pens would double.\nThis goal was achieved through significant efforts from our manufacturing colleagues and partners around the globe. In 2024, our capacity expansion efforts will continue with equal urgency and will be accomplished not just through increased auto injector capacity, but also through alternative presentation like our multi-use KwikPen, which received regulatory approval in the UK in late January.\nWe expect our parenteral manufacturing site in Concord, North Carolina, will initiate production as early as the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025, and we are pursuing a host of other projects, internal and external, large and small, to further expand capacity.\nNow, I'll provide a bit more context on the timing and pace of our increases and supply plans in 2024. While we're continuing to expand supply every quarter, we expect the most significant production increases to come in the second half of the year. We expect our production of sellable doses in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5x the production in the second half of 2023.\nNote that while last year, our commentary focused on capacity of auto injectors devices compared to 2022, we're now referring sellable doses produced, which is more relevant to patients and investors. Beyond incretins, we look forward to progressing our launch trajectory for two other Lilly medicines approved to launch in 2023, Jaypirca and Omvoh.\nJaypirca was initially approved by the FDA in January 2023 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma under the accelerated approval program, received FDA approval also under the accelerated approval program in December 2023 for adult patients with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. We look forward to the ongoing opportunity to help patients with this medicine as our best phase III program continues.\nOmvoh was approved in October 2023 in the US and earlier that year in Japan, Europe, and other markets and represents a compelling new option for patients struggling with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. In 2024, we look forward to potential US launches of two more medicines, donanemab and lebrikizumab. We continue to expect FDA regulatory actions on donanemab in Q4 2024 and remain confident in the substantial potential for donanemab to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease\n. Due to the current state of diagnostic and treatment readiness, initial uptake will be somewhat limited, and we expect donanemab to contribute only modestly to growth in 2024 once approved. Lebrikizumab, which last year was approved and launched in Europe under the brand name Ebglyss by our partner Almirall, received regulatory approval in Japan in January.\nAs for the US, we look forward to the potential approval of lebrikizumab by the end of the year. We believe the efficacy, safety, and dosing of lebrikizumab can make it a compelling option for patients and prescribers in a large and growing market for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Given the expected timing of FDA regulatory action, we expect lebrikizumab to contribute only modestly to revenue growth in 2024.\nBeyond our recently launched portfolio of medicine, we expect continued growth from Verzenio driven by the early breast cancer indication, where the magnitude and maturity of our clinical data reinforces it as a standard of care treatment in node-positive high-risk early breast cancer.\nJardiance has been another outstanding contributor to growth, and we expect revenue growth to continue in 2024, though at a slower pace as strong strip growth may be dampened by pricing dynamics in the US. Outside the US, we expect an acceleration of growth in every major geography, led not only by the anticipated launches of Trulicity but also continued strong growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. Lastly, we seek to create long-term value beyond this decade.\nWe will continue to invest across our value chain in our recent and upcoming potential launches in our pipeline and in our manufacturing footprint. Slide 16 summarizes our initial 2024 financial guidance. Starting at the top line, revenue is expected to be between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion.\nUsing the midpoint of the 2024 range, this represents roughly 20% growth or 29% growth for our core business, which excludes the impact of divestitures that took place in 2023. In terms of phasing of our revenue growth throughout 2024, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, consistent with the increased availability of increases and doses.\nIn terms of pricing for our core business, which excludes divestitures, we expect a high single-digit percent price decline in 2024. The lingering base period impact of the Mounjaro non-covered copay card dynamics will dampen these price declines in the first half of 2024, with more significant price declines expected in the second half of the year. Starting this year, we're taking a streamlined approach to our guidance line items relating to expenses.\nRather than providing three separate guidance line items for gross margin, research and development costs, and marketing and sales administrative costs, we are presenting a single new ratio representing our margin after planned costs, calculated by subtracting R&D costs and marketing, sales, and administrative costs from gross margin and dividing that figure by revenue. We express this ratio as a percentage, and for 2024, we expect it to be in the range of 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis.\nWhile we are not providing a specific guidance number for gross margin as a percent of sales, our expectations remain consistent that we will maintain gross margin of approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis as productivity gains and volumes are offset by pricing pressures and the cost of new manufacturing facilities.\nAs for expense growth across key categories, we expect marketing, sales, and administrative expenses to again grow in 2024, though at a slower pace than revenue, with growth driven by marketing investments in our recently launched and upcoming launch products. We also expect R&D expenses in 2024 to increase, driven by growing investments across all phases of our pipeline as we invest for the future, with the majority of dollar growth driven by ongoing and new late-phase opportunities.\nWe expect R&D expenses to increase at a higher rate than marketing, sales, and administrative expenses. Other income and expenses are expected to be between $400 million and $500 million of expense, primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to taxes, we expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%.\nNote that this rate does not assume withdrawal or repeal of the provision in the 2017 tax act requiring capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Should such a change take effect, our effective tax rate for 2024 would be moderately higher. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.20 to 12.70 on a non-GAAP basis.\nConsistent with our prior practice, we're not including any potential or pending acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in our 2024 guidance, and we will provide updates each quarter on the impact of IPR&D on earnings per share if acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges are incurred. For guidance modeling purposes, we're currently estimating diluted weighted average share outstanding for 2024 to be approximately 903 million. We entered 2024 with strong momentum and a remarkable opportunity to help millions more patients with our medicines.\nFor our investors, 2024 should be another exciting year driven by expected revenue growth in our core business nearing 30% and continued investment to drive future growth. Our outlook for top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion remains on track. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our continued progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. I'll start with our progress against diabetes, obesity, and complications thereof. Today, we announced positive results from Synergy NASH, a phase 2 study of Trulicity in adults with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, also known as MASH. As shown on Slide 17, the study met its primary endpoint, with up to 74% of participants achieving an absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks, compared to less than 13% of participants reaching this endpoint on placebo.\nWe are equally encouraged by results seen in the secondary endpoint evaluating improvement in fibrosis. While the study was not designed to be statistically powered to evaluate improvement in fibrosis, the study results showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect across all doses on the proportion of participants achieving a decrease of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of MASH to placebo.\nThe adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials studying Trulicity in people living with obesity or type 2 diabetes. The full Synergy NASH results will be presented at a medical conference later this year. As you know, late last year, we received FDA approval of Zepbound, which marks Lilly's first approved treatment for obesity. This is a landmark occasion for patients and for the field.\nZepbound is the first and only approved treatment activating two incretin hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1, to tackle an underlying cause of excess weight. Also, in early-stage development, we have now advanced our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist for the treatment of diabetes into phase I and our long-acting atrial natriuretic peptide for treatment of heart failure into phase I.\nWe've advanced mazdutide into phase II for obesity as we've begun to dose patients in that study. We are pleased that early this year, our partner Innovent reported positive results in the phase III GLORY-1 study of mazdutide in Chinese adults with obesity. Innovent holds the development and commercialization rights for mazdutide in China, and Lilly retains the rights in the rest of the world. Moving to oncology.\nToday, we shared that in the phase III CYCLONE-2 trial, Verzenio added to abiraterone did not meet the primary endpoint of improved radiographic progression-free survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nFor the study, we employed an adaptive phase 2/3 design, and while the phase II stage met the pre-specified threshold for the independent data monitoring committee to recommend initiation of phase III, the signal was not confirmed in the phase III portion in a larger sample size. The overall safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the known profiles of the medicines. We anticipate sharing full results from the CYCLONE-2 study at a future medical meeting.\nSince our last earnings call, Jaypirca received approval under the FDA's accelerated approval program for the treatment of adult patients with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.\nWe also reported that the phase III confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval, known as Bruin CLL 321, met its primary endpoint, and we plan to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. With the CLL and SLL approvals, Jaypirca is now the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent BTK inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL and SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. This was the second approval for Jaypirca in 2023, with the first in patients with MCL.\nWe believe these two indications only represent the beginning of the eventual impact Jaypirca can have for patients, and we look forward to seeing the data from the rest of the phase III program across CLL, SLL, and MCL. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of Point Biopharma, which begins Lilly's entry into radioligand therapy, a promising technology with potential to deliver meaningful advances against a range of cancers.\nWe welcome our new Point colleagues to Lilly, and we look forward to building on their work to grow this capability at Lilly. 2024 is also poised to be a particularly productive year for new clinical starts in oncology, as we begin to see the results of the new oncology R&D strategy that we implemented about four years ago after the Loxo acquisition.\nThrough a combination of internal discovery efforts and business development, we expect to put at least five new molecules into the clinic this year: a wild-type selective KRAS G12D inhibitor, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, two antibody-drug conjugates with topoisomerase payloads, one against Nectin-4 and one against folate receptor alpha, and an actinium PSMA radioligand therapy.\nI'll speak in a moment about our clinical KRAS G12C program, but you can see that we're putting real effort into developing a suite of RAS-directed therapeutics, and we're excited to see those discovery efforts result in three potential medicines so far. Of course, we'll have to see which of these deliver on our target clinical profiles, but we're optimistic about this early-phase portfolio, and we've certainly diversified the modalities in our pipeline.\nIn addition, we're excited that olomorasib, our KRAS G12C inhibitor, has progressed into phase II as we're finalizing dose selection under Project Optimus for the phase III program, which we plan to start later this year. You can now see the full design of that study on clinicaltrials.gov. By way of reminder, we started this program years behind our competitors, and through focused effort behind what looks like a great molecule to us, we've made up the vast majority of that time.\nWe believe we're now neck and neck with our closest competitors with a medicine that we hope to show combines better with PD-1. Lastly, in oncology, we've terminated development of our RET inhibitor 2 as it did not meet our threshold to move forward with internal development. In immunology, we moved two new assets into phase I, and we advanced our Kv1.3 antagonist for psoriasis into phase I.\nLebrikizumab was approved in the EU for atopic dermatitis under the brand name Ebglyss, which is marketed by our partner Almirall there. In January of this year, we were pleased to have Ebglyss approved in Japan. In neuroscience, in January, our wholly owned subsidiary Akouos announced positive clinical results from the phase 1/2 AK-OTOF-101 study, which demonstrated hearing restoration within 30 days of a single administration in the first participant, an individual with more than a decade of profound hearing loss.\nThe surgical administration and the investigational therapy were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. These results highlight our commitment to help solve some of humanity's most challenging healthcare problems and make life better for individual patients. We now show OTOF gene therapy in phase II on our pipeline chart as we've begun enrolling younger patients in the phase II portion of the study.\nOn slide 18, we highlight our select pipeline assets with updates of the last earnings call, and slide 19 summarizes our key events for 2023. I noted the key updates on each of these slides in my therapeutic area comments. Turning to slide 20, we'd like to highlight potential key events for 2024. As you can see, this year will be another important year as we look to progress our late-stage pipeline.\nIn 2023, we initiated phase III development programs for our next generation of incretins, which are our oral agent orforglipron and our novel weekly injectable triagonist retatrutide. These programs are progressing and enrolling well. We look forward to seeing the first set of phase III results on orforglipron next year. This year, we're planning to initiate a phase III program in type 2 diabetes for retatrutide, complementing the ongoing trials in obesity and related complications.\nAlso this year, we are planning to initiate a phase III program for lepodisiran, our Lp(a)-lowering siRNA therapy in cardiovascular disease. On Trulicity, we're looking forward to a number of additional key data readouts this year. Beyond Synergy NASH, we expect to see results from the phase III obstructive sleep apnea, and phase III heart failure studies this year.\nWe note increased investor interest in the timing of CVOT, and we can reiterate that we expect the data in 2025, notwithstanding the clinicaltrials.gov listing, which will be updated soon to reflect our current assumptions based on event rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to have results of SURMOUNT-5, which is our head-to-head study of Trulicity compared to high-dose semaglutide in participants with obesity. We also expect the full phase III program readout on our weekly basal insulin, insulin efsitora alfa, later this year.\nMoving to neuroscience, we're looking forward to FDA action and the potential launch of donanemab in Q1 of this year, and we are progressing with regulatory reviews around the world. We've now launched a p-tau217 blood-based diagnostic test, and we will continue to scale this throughout 2024.We'll also continue to partner with others in the field to ensure physicians have multiple tools to aid in timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\nIn immunology, following the mirikizumab positive phase III data in Crohn's disease, we plan to submit to the FDA for this indication this year. Additionally, following the US FDA complete response letter on lebrikizumab, we expect regulatory action by the end of the year in the US. Finally, in oncology, as I mentioned before, we look forward to moving our KRAS G12C inhibitor, olomorasib, into phase III later this year following phase II dose selection.\nLastly, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our imlunestrant phase III study, EMBER-3, in participants with metastatic breast cancer in both monotherapy and in combination with Verzenio. This past year was busy and productive, and we expect more of the same in 2024 as we make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline for the benefit of patients. I'll turn the call back to closing remarks.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Dan, and congrats to you and the Lilly team for a big year. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum. We achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approvals of Zepbound and Jaypirca.\nWe continue to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, early-phase capabilities, and in business development, all of which will serve as a foundation for future growth. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of Point Biopharma and announced plans to build a new manufacturing site in Germany. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. Lastly, in January, we announced that Johna Norton, our Executive Vice President of Global Quality, will be retiring at the end of July after 34 years of service.\nDuring her tenure, Johna has overseen significant expansion, modernization, and improvements in our quality and manufacturing processes. I'd like to thank her for her many years of outstanding service to Lilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate our Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Before diving into the Q&A, I wanted to clarify one point.\nWe may have had some muffled sound during Dan's prepared remarks regarding the timing of regulatory action on donanemab, and as Dan mentioned, that timing is expected to be Q1 of 2024 this year. I received some notes that there were some muffled sounds, so I just wanted to clarify on that important point. Now, for Q&A, we'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner.\nSo, consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller, so we ask you to limit to one question per caller. We'll end the call at 11:15AM. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue, and we'll get to your question if time allows. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality.The first question today is coming from Terrence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terrence, your line is live.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress. Just wondering for your GLP-1 franchise, ex-US under index versus your key competitor, just wondering what are some of the hurdles to closing that gap as we think about the ramp in 2024, but also into 2025? Thank you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Terrence, for the question. I'll hand it over to Ilya Yufa, president of Lilly International, for that question.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Terrence. As we think about Mounjaro launches outside of the US, we have already launched in a number of select markets. We have a foundation to be competitive in many of our markets, and we anticipate continued launches.\nWe've just launched in vial format in select markets outside of the US, namely in Australia, Canada, Germany, and Poland. And we just received a KwikPen approval in the UK, and so we're anticipating launch there as we get additional regulatory approvals for our multi-use KwikPen. And we monitor our ramp-up and capacity for supply. We'll continue to launch in other markets throughout the year, and so we anticipate further growth anticipated for launches of Mounjaro outside of the US.\nand continue with that throughout the year as well as into 2025.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Ilya. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. On Zepbound, it seems like you're making strong progress on coverage, but just interested in expectations for the remainder of this year as we think about just where coverage could go and just how to think about ASP. I guess the core question is, is it reasonable to think that most payers who cover will add Zepbound this year? Thank you.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Patrik to comment on that question about Zepbound coverage.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nYes, thank you very much, Chris. As stated, we are pleased. We are so early in launch with 35% commercial access, having contract release and Cigna.\nOur efforts moving forward will really be to continue to expand payer access, but not only. We will do that with a very disciplined approach as we did with Mounjaro, but also to make sure that we get to employer opt-in. As I alluded to in her prepared remarks, that's going to take some time, but we are assuming that with the current access we have, that our access will be along the lines of what the competition has referred to, around 50%.\nLet me just emphasize that when it comes to employer opt-in, there is not one reliable source for employer opt-in. I think that's something that we need to continue to monitor, and we'll come back with more data during coming earnings calls. Overall, a good start, and we will continue our efforts to increase payer access.I think we're quite encouraged with what we have heard from the marketplace so far. Employer opt-in will take longer, but we believe that we are well positioned in that regard as well.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrick. Next question, Paul.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nOh, thanks very much, and congrats on all the progress and the success here. But just wanted to get a quick sense from Dan. Do you see a prospect from Synergy NASH for accelerated approval, and can you confirm that while clinically significant, the secondary endpoint of fibrosis stage improvement was not statistically significant? Thanks. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Dan?\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Seamus. This data is really quite new to us, but we're really excited about it.\nWe haven't had a chance yet to talk to the FDA here at all about next steps, but we're looking forward to having that opportunity. Of course, this was a small trial, about 190 participants, but it did use liver biopsies, of course, to assess the endpoints here. With respect to the improvement in fibrosis, I think I probably previously stated that I was unsure whether it would be possible for incretin-based therapies to reverse fibrosis in patients based on competitor readouts in the field.\nBut really excited to see this data with clinically meaningful improvement in fibrosis. There's different doses. There's different statistical methods that can be applied here, accounting for dropouts, particularly in the placebo group. So we'll have to wait for the scientific presentation to see all the p-values there.\nBut we're pretty positive on this data package as a whole and what this could mean for patients, both in terms of stopping progression of NASH and reversing fibrosis.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\nThe next question is coming from Umer Rafat from Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is live.\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, as you think about manufacturing build-out in various sites, which is obviously very important for all the existing GLP-1 demand, I'm curious, how are you balancing that dollar investment with your probabilities on orforglipron's clinical and commercial odds, especially with all the blinded data that's coming in?\nThanks, Umer. Dave?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, happy to answer that. Of course, as we enter this phase of really strong growth in the incretins, we're very focused on allocating capital, but top priority is creating new capacities. The gating factors are not really financial for us right now.\nSo you can expect us to be investing fully. We're not slowing down because of cash flow or whatever. It's really a function of the technical capacities, both in people and in suppliers, to be able to bring facilities online. That's particularly true in the parenteral side. You're referencing orforglipron. Here, we do plan to build ahead of phase III at risk. I think given the probability we assess internally, as well as the opportunity on the other side of a positive phase III, we see that as a wise investment.\nAnd as we've commented on before, it relies as you would know on very different assets inside Lilly as well as outside of Lilly. So here you have organic chemistry, API, and tablets and capsules. So pretty different setup. So we're paralleling that with our robust injectable investments.\nIf we're wrong, okay, we'll have to eat that in the end if orforglipron isn't a strong product. But if it is, I think it does begin to change the math on supply in this category, and I think that's a bet worth taking. Thanks, Dave.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nPaul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. On SURPASS CVOT, you mentioned it's slipped to 2025. I assume that implies the one interim look has come and gone, and then you're evaluating both non-inferiority and superiority. Would you agree that superiority is really what you need to show here, and what's your confidence in achieving that?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tim, for those couple of questions. Maybe we'll field the one on the interim look, Dan.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nYeah, sure. Well, thanks for that question, Tim. As you know, Lilly doesn't comment on interims.\nProbably most trials in our portfolio do have opportunities for interim looks, but that is not, I think, germane at all to the question on the timing on ClinicalTrials.gov, which was before and continues to be the time point at which we'll have final data. When we initially put that time point in ClinicalTrials.gov, it was in early 2020. We hadn't started enrolling the trial yet, so that was based on our assumption on enrollment rates, but probably more importantly on event rates.\nAnd as the trial matures, we get a view on event rates. I know it's frustrating for investors and for us, perhaps, to wait a longer time to get events, but of course, that's great news for patients when the event rates are slower, remembering that this is a head-to-head trial with a drug, Trulicity, that we already know is active in preventing MACE events.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan.\nPaul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director of Biopharma Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. I have a question regarding your sleep apnea study. How much benefit do you think from baseline is required for this to be clinically meaningful? Is it 50% or more? And do you think the trial is big enough to seek a label in sleep apnea?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Dan, back to you.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nYeah, thanks. There isn't really a well-established threshold for clinical meaningfulness in sleep apnea. Of course, the commonly used measure here is an index of how many apneic or hypoxic events a patient has while sleeping. Certainly, drugs in this category, I think, have great potential to improve that. We're excited to see what tirzepatide can see.\nProbably in addition to the absolute percent improvement in AHI that we'll be looking for, I'd also like to see patients switching from one category, for example, intermediate to mild disease or things like that. So we'll be looking at a number of things to assess clinical meaningfulness here, but I'm quite optimistic.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is live.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Cantor\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how you think about sizing the downstream opportunities for a GLP-1 such as tirzepatide, maybe in NASH, some of the other indications that you're going after as well. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Louise, for that queston. So about the downstream opportunities in NASH and elsewhere, Patrik, do you want to field that?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nNo, thank you very much. I think there are two important aspects.\nThe first one is when we refer to employer opt-in. I think employers are really looking actively into benefits of listing anti-obesity medications. And whatever data we can generate here, being in the cardiovascular space, being in OSA, or being in NASH and other indications, will be extremely important for increased employer opt-in. The second piece will be in Medicare Part D. As long as CROA is not passed, I think data in those comorbidities will be critical to enable access for patients in Medicare Part D. So those are truly the key drivers for those indications.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrik. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Berenberg\n\nThank you for taking my question. It's on tirzepatide obesity. I'm interested to hear why you've taken the decision not to launch under the Zepbound brand outside the US.\nbut rather seek a label expansion for weight loss for Mounjaro. Does that relate to simplicity, perhaps faster reimbursement access? And I wonder if you foresee any risk here that ex-US governments prefer ultimately to keep diabetes and obesity budgets separate? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Kerry, for the questions. I'll hand over to Ilya to talk about the branding of tirzepatide OUS.\n\nIlya Yufa\n\nEVP and President of Lilly USA, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. Yeah, so for tirzepatide outside of the US, it depends on a number of different factors, whether it's regulatory or competitor market dynamics. There are some payer dynamics as well. We don't anticipate that being a challenge in terms of negotiating reimbursement either for type 2 diabetes or for chronic weight management. We continue to have those discussions in a number of markets and are optimistic about our ability to commercialize under different brand scenarios.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ilya. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Jeff, your line is live.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Dave, I know you guys formally announced LillyDirect last fall, but should we view it as a platform that just streamlines access to providers and LillyMeds, or is there a monetization model or some market differentiation that could also play out over time?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company",
    "content2": "Thank you. I can start, Patrick. Yeah, jump in. Yeah, thanks for the question. The idea was really actually born out of the challenges patients face every day in the US and sometimes seeing doctors. And you'll note we have a Doctor Finder tool as well as telehealth partners on the platform for migraine, diabetes, and obesity. Finding medicines in their pharmacies, that's been a challenge.\nAnd I think particularly as supplies are tight, many patients report driving to five, six, seven pharmacies to find the medicine they need. This simplifies that process. And then I think in addition, there's been a lot of noise about drugs that are illicit or copies or compounded versions of Zepbound or other weight loss drugs. And that's concerning to us, and I think it's concerning to patients.\nSo by going to LillyDirect, literally, they have confidence in the supply. And finally, application of our savings programs has also been a challenge at the pharmacy counter, and that happens 100% of the time on LillyDirect. We haven't thought about it as a way to create some new retail distribution business. It's a way to serve the patients that want our medicines better. That's sort of the frame we're in now.\nEarly days, we're trying to develop it to be smoother, better, include more products over time, have better information about physicians and telehealth providers. So look for more developments there, but good start so far. A lot of energy and enthusiasm from the patient community.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from David. David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David, your line is live.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thank you and congrats on today's updates. So my question is for Dave and Dan on lean muscle loss associated with incretin use. Could you help us understand Lilly's take on this debate and comment on tirzepatide's data to date relative to semaglutide? What I've observed is that SURMOUNT-1 showed a 3:1 to lean muscle loss ratio, whereas semaglutide's STEP 1 trial showed a 1.5:1 ratio, albeit with slightly different assessment. Thank you. Thanks, Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nI'll have Dan field that. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nThanks for your question. Maybe just starting with our take on lean versus fat mass, I think the ratio of lean to fat mass is an important thing to think about. Body composition, not just body weight, matters to patients. For example, in risk of type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that body ratio seems to be important.\nThe good news is that for patients on tirzepatide, that ratio appears to improve. As you pointed out, they lose far more fat mass than lean mass. And so in every trial we've done, at the end of the trial, if you measure body composition, it's better, a higher ratio of lean to fat than at the beginning of the trial. So we see this changing body composition as a potential benefit of tirzepatide to be further explored. Of course, it's also a benefit we want to further extend.\nYou've seen us try to improve the total amount of body weight loss. We're also trying to further improve, I should say, the change in body mass composition, and that's why you saw us acquire Versanis and experiment with drugs like bimagrumab. The numbers you quote from the tirzepatide and semaglutide studies seem right to me. Of course, they're not head-to-head studies, but it does raise a question here about whether there's a potential benefit of GIP agonism here in addition to GLP-1 agonism.That's probably the way I would interpret those data.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, all. Thank you for taking my question. I would love to get your take on how you're thinking about the opportunity for the oral GLP-1s.\nWe've seen some mixed data from competitors, and I just would love to get how you see this evolving in context of your investment in oral orforglipron. Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan, for the question. Patrik, maybe I'll go to you to talk about how we think about an oral agent.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nWell, thank you very much. When we look at the opportunity in obesity, we have more than 110 million in the US. We have 650 million globally. I think taking into account the current supply constraints across markets, it's impossible to reach all of those with injectables. So I think that's the big opportunity with our orforglipron.\nWhat we have seen so far in phase II, if we can replicate those data in phase III, we have an oral medicine here with a weight loss along the lines of the best competitive incretin, not at the level of tirzepatide, but at the level of the best incretin in the marketplace and with no food or water restrictions. So we really see the opportunity here with orforglipron to reach patients across the globe.\nThere is another component as well. If we look at the current market, approximately 20% of patients with obesity are actually concerned to take an injectable. So that's another opportunity with orforglipron. So we believe that's a really strong card in our hands moving forward in the space of chronic weight management.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Patrik. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Scala from TD Cowen.\nSteve, your line is live.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you so much. There could be several reasons why Lilly is not initiating a phase III trial of tirzepatide in NASH. First, Lilly believes it has better molecules. Second, there's something in the phase II data which is less than ideal. Or third, Lilly will do a phase III. It just hasn't gotten around to finalizing plans. But that really can't be it to draw a parallel. You're starting a phase III with Lp(a) without even telling us the phase II was positive. So what would be best for us to conclude about tirzepatide in NASH?Thank you.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nThank you, Steve. Yeah, thanks, Steve, for the clever analysis here. So first of all, I should just say we literally just got this phase II data. So give us a chance to determine our next steps on plans.\nProbably I debunk at least one of the hypotheses here. There's nothing bad in the data that would stop us from going to phase III. In terms of having a better molecule, probably we do in retatrutide. Of course, we don't have that kind of phase II data here for retatrutide, and so that's based on liver fat reduction, which was just incredible in the phase II trial. Still, though, I think having a positive phase II trial here with really meaningful data in NASH obligates us to think about next steps.\nAs I said, that's going to the FDA to talk to them. I would say in terms of planning a phase III for any drug in NASH, the really important priority for us is to move away as much as we can from liver biopsies and replace them with non-invasive testing.\nI think we and others in the field have made a lot of progress there. We see analogies here to other disease areas, and we hope that in the future it'll be possible to conduct phase III NASH trials without relying on biopsies. That would really have a profound effect on the feasibility of running these trials quickly, but also in the clinical application of NASH drugs where those non-invasive biomarkers could be used to identify patients for treatment and monitor their response to therapy rather than biopsy.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Duration of use of the GLP-1s across the diabetes and obesity populations. Previously, you've characterized the duration in the range of 15 months for diabetes and have commented that you don't believe we have enough experience. Any updates there?\nWhen do you think we will have enough experience to be able to get a better gauge of duration of use median in the obesity population, at least initially?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Chris. Patrik, do you want to comment on duration of therapy?\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nYeah. Thank you very much, Chris. I think you're right. It's quite challenging. It's still early days with both Mounjaro and particularly Zepbound, and we have been facing some specific dynamics in terms of supply and also changes to the copay program. However, when we look at the recent data for Mounjaro, it's encouraging, and it suggests that patients that start therapy back in Q1 2023 are having a persistency at least along the lines of other injectable incretins.\nFor Zepbound, definitely too early, but we strongly believe that patients will be motivated when they see the benefits of a drug.\nAnd there will, of course, be many factors impacting both supply, macroeconomic, and microeconomic. But we are convinced that there will be a finite duration of treatment also for obesity since when we look into even heart failure and type 2 diabetes, more than a 12-month period of adherence is considered long. But encouraging data in type 2 diabetes so far, and with Zepbound, we will see that there will for sure be an end of duration based upon what we have seen in other chronic diseases, but we believe that the features itself will be motivating for patients.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Patrick. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from Akash Tiwari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\n\nAkash Tiwari\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. So David, at JPMorgan, you made an interesting comment on orforglipron where you mentioned the molecule has lots to prove here.\nCan you elaborate a bit on what you mean by this? And what's your confidence on Orfo's DDI profile? It seems to have a bit of CYP3A4 inhibition. So will this drug be able to get dosed with SGLT2s given they were excluded in some of your earlier studies?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. That was for me. I feel like I could frame why I said that, but maybe David can comment on the specific DDI questions in SGLT2 co-administration. I just said that because we're just starting the phase III. We all know small molecule, there's a bit of empiricism in terms of eliminating safety risks. Of course, every day as we expose more patients to the drug and we have higher doses, that's a good day where we don't announce that the drug has a problem. At some point, we reach a lot of confidence.\nWe just weren't at that point. We're not at it now. I think we're running the phase III experiment, and we need to discharge the off-target safety that is, I think, inherent in small molecule discovery. And we've seen in this class from others, but nothing specific on my mind. Maybe Dan can further reassure us.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. Of course, that's just the normal phase III types of risk, new safety signals which could always arise. I think with respect to DDI and co-administration with SGLT2s, we expect that to be possible, and we have that ongoing in our phase III trials. There are patients who will be dosed with or being dosed with orforglipron as well as other drugs like SGLT2s.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, both. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCan I just ask your thoughts on GIP agonism versus antagonism given data yesterday from a competitor suggesting more limited effects on things like blood pressure and lipid modifications? Just how differentiated do you think an agonism approach is versus antagonism and why you think agonism is the way forward? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nYeah. Yeah. Well, first of all, for the unfair comparison, we have so much data now on the benefits of GIP agonism from tens of thousands of participants in randomized clinical trials for tirzepatide. So we're extremely confident here about the benefits of GIP agonism. Adding to that data, we have experimented with a pure GIP agonist that doesn't have any GLP-1, and we reported the benefits there in a phase I study. We're contrasting that here to a small phase I study that was recently published with a drug that has both GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism.\nI noted in that publication that GIP antagonism is at a much lower affinity. So it probably only starts to antagonize GIP at very high doses. That's probably a question for that company. But I noted at the high doses, actually an increase in free fatty acids and complete attenuation of the decrease in triglycerides in the clinical trial.\nThose are some effects that we attribute to GIP. And so I'm not surprised that antagonism of GIP is starting to have some negative effects once that kicks in. We also see GIP agonism as having positive benefits on tolerability, reducing potentially nausea and vomiting. And again, I think maybe at the higher doses, you could probably see some hints of the opposite effect with antagonism. So pretty glad with the decision we took, and let's see how the field continues to evolve.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dan. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess over the prior two earnings calls, there had been at least an acknowledgment that CMOs were going to be part of the equation going forward for supply on the incretin side. I guess does the development yesterday have any sort of direct or indirect impacts as you think about that part of the equation going forward?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Carter. Anat, do you want to field that?\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. And I've mentioned on this call as well that we have a very extensive manufacturing agenda which does include third parties. While our strategy is and has always been to develop more internally, we do have third parties as well. So we saw the announcement that came out from Novo yesterday regarding the intent to acquire Catalent.\nWe certainly have questions about that transaction and need to learn more. We don't know Catalent is an integral part or manufacturer of both commercial and pipeline products for the industry, especially in diabetes and obesity. And we have products with these sites as well. So our focus today is on ensuring that continuity of supply of medicine for patients is uninterrupted, as well as we intend on holding Catalent accountable to their contract with us as we look and we gain more information on this proposed transaction.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to circle back to Carter's question.\nGiven Lilly is well-capitalized and manufacturing capacity being the priority, I mean, could you expect more buy versus build to get around some of the technical bottlenecks and the non-trivial FDA process? Just want to get your thoughts there.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDavid? Yeah, maybe I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the question, James. As I mentioned, on the earlier question related to orforglipron, we don't think of ourselves as capital-constrained buying or building in the space. The reality is there just isn't built capacity that's available. Most of it that's being used is already deployed against the leading products in the GLP-1 space, at least any at scale. And new capacity has a lead time of three to four years. So all of the things that are coming online now, like we mentioned today, are very large site in Concord, North Carolina.\nThat's a big note of capacity for the sector and certainly for Lilly. I mean, that was announced two and a half years ago, and it will just begin production at the end of this year. So that's the problem. And why is that? Well, of course, greenfield building is difficult. Repurposing is difficult. But also, these are technically complex facilities. There's not an infinite number of people who know how to set them up.\nAnd the supply chain for the machines that make the products is also constrained. So at this point, I don't think there's an easy way forward. And I think even in yesterday's announcements, we have a lot of questions about that. But I think even the purchaser or our competitor said it will take many years for them to be able to increase capacity within that purchase.\nSo it's just not an easy problem to solve. I think over time it will ease. There'll be more capacity brought online by us or a competitor and maybe others, including third parties. And new technology will emerge like orforglipron or other oral options that tap into different asset bases. So I know it's frustrating for investors. It's frustrating for us. It's even more frustrating for patients. But it's just sort of the situation we're in, is there'll be steady gains in manufacturing over the coming several years and perhaps bigger gains after that.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Dave. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Rajesh Kumar from HSBC. Rajesh, your line is live.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nLead Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi there. Can you give us some color on how the access with employers is playing out?\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAre you getting exclusive access for your drugs, or you're being added to the existing access your competitors' drugs have? And what is the nature of discussion, especially given that Zepbound is priced at a more attractive list price? I'm assuming with rebate, the differences might be a bit smaller, but any color there might be super helpful.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. Thanks, Rajesh. I think we covered that in Chris Schott's question earlier. I don't know if Patrik had anything to add or if we could just move on.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nNo, I think the only addition would be that we are always aiming for open access. We believe that's important for the providers and the patients we are serving. So that's going to be our aim when it comes to employer opt-in as well.\nAnd we believe a move by pricing Zepbound 22% below the competition despite launching with a best-in-class profile is also a good signal for increased and enhanced employer opt-in.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks. Thank you, Patrick. Paul, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThese are going to be maybe two more. Apparently, the next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew, your line is live.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nManaging Director and Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you. Could you talk to your scenario planning for post-2032 when the potential exists for generic semaglutide to be launched? There seems to be significant interest and investment in capacity expansion. Now, obviously, this is complex, as you outlined, given not just API, but fit and finish and IP and the rest of it. But I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of future-proofing your business against step edits and other thinking about your broader incretin portfolio.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Andrew. It's a very long-term question.\nI'll pass over to Anat to talk about 2032 and beyond.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWe do look at 2032, and we actually do look beyond. The way we look at our business, it is a long-term business. It's not a business that changes every year or two. So we do look at the long-term horizon, both in terms of the commercial products as well as what's coming through the pipeline.\nAnd as we think through the events of the patent cliff, whether for our products or those of competitors, our way of managing through that is to bring new breakthrough innovation to the marketplace. So to raise the bar on our own innovation, we don't wait for that to occur or happen by competition, but to bring something into the market that provides a meaningfully improved outcome for patients.\nSo in this specific example, you use the GLPs. Certainly tirzepatide brought in a higher bar for weight loss for patients with chronic weight management. And retatrutide that Dan referenced in his comments currently in phase III has the potential to bring even further improved outcome for patients. So that's how we see that. In terms of capacity and whether the question is on whether companies should be or shouldn't be building given that there is a patent expiry at the end, we do look at that, and we look at the long-term horizon.\nBut certainly, the investments in a manufacturing facility, for example, the ones we've just mentioned, whether it's in Concord, North Carolina, or Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, between the two of them, it's about a $4 billion investment, are certainly a good investment of our capital given that size of opportunity over the long term.\nI will say that as you think about potential for either generic or biosimilar entry in this space in general, it will require quite a massive investment in capital. Just the sites that I've mentioned today on the call, and we've talked about for the past year or so, total about $11 billion. And that's on top of already substantial network we have around the globe, primarily in the US and Europe for production. So as you think about entering into that space, it will require some significant capital commitments.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Cantor\n\nThank you, Anat. Maybe the final question, Paul, and then we'll wrap up.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thank you so much. So one of the competitor data sets, obviously, everyone's watching is the Amgen data this year.\nTheir messaging is around longer dosing frequency, monthly dosing, and then possibly a greater effect of weight loss off therapy. So can you comment on your views of the value of extended dosing, like monthly or longer? And then do you believe in that argument about efficacy being sustained off therapy, or is that just a function of the fact that this drug lasts longer?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDan, yeah.\n\nDaniel Skovronsky\n\nPresident of Immunology, Eli and Company\n\nI'll start with the second, and then maybe Patrik will weigh in on potential value here. But, although that could be a good question for Amgen. Look, I think the sustainability data I saw in that publication are a bit underwhelming. It's a very high-dose drug at half-life of an antibody. So just based on plasma concentrations that would be expected to remain there after a month or two, it doesn't surprise me.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nBut what we're seeing is that at doses that are reasonably well tolerated, if there were any doses that were reasonably well tolerated, weight loss is lower than what we would need to see to take a molecule to phase III, for sure. And sustainability doesn't appear to be at all differentiated.\n\nPatrik Jonsson\n\nEVP and President of Lilly International, Eli Lilly\n\nMy only addition would be that when we look at market research, of course, convenience is one factor, but it's not necessarily the most important factor when it comes to provider and consumer selecting treatments. So I'm really excited about the cards we have in our hands. Of course, tirzepatide remaining a foundational treatment for obesity, but also with the addition of retatrutide and orforglipron. And also, the opportunity is here to look into options with additional non-weight loss dependent pharmacology to complement the assets we have in the pipeline.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you both.\nDave, do you want to wrap us up?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, absolutely. That's good, Joe. Thanks. We appreciate everyone participating today and, of course, your interest in the company. 2023 was a really productive year for Lilly, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2024 with a strong guide today. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with Joe and the IR team if you have additional questions that weren't answered. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. To request assistance during the call, please press star then zero, and an operator will assist you offline. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Paul. Thanks, everybody, for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2023 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, and joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's chair and CEO, Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience, Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International, Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo@Lilly, Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Sprengnether, and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide three.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Joe. In Q3, Lilly continued the progress we made so far this year. We delivered strong financial results, continued to advance our R&D pipeline, and invested in our future through several business development transactions.\nAs you can see on slide four, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 24%. Our new products and growth products combined contributed approximately 17 percentage points toward volume growth, with over 12 percentage points coming from our growth products.\nLast week we announced that the FDA approved Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This marks Lilly's first approval in the U.S. for a type of inflammatory bowel disease, and it's important for Lilly's growth in its immunology portfolio. In addition to the FDA approval for Omvoh, we had several other important pipeline updates since our last earnings call. Specifically, Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression, and we reported positive phase III results from the VIVID-1 trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab based on inspection findings at a third-party manufacturer.\nThe letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, the safety, or the label. We will continue to work with the third party manufacturer and the FDA to address the findings to make lebrikizumab available to patients as quickly as possible. In terms of business development, we once again had a very active quarter. In Q3 we completed the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio which will further enable us to focus on our current and new product launches. The financial impact of this transaction is reflected in the Q3 results. Additionally, within the quarter we completed the acquisition of two clinical stage companies adding to our Phase II portfolio, DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio, as well as the acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics and Sigilon Therapeutics.\nWe also announced that we reached an agreement to acquire Point Biopharma, which if approved has the potential to expand our oncology capabilities into next-generation radioligand therapies. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 call, including several important regulatory, clinical, and other updates we are sharing today. Now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q3.\nResults.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We're pleased with the strong financial performance this quarter, highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth representing robust momentum in our core business. Q3 revenue increased 37% versus Q3 2022, excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and from the COVID-19 antibodies. Revenue increased 24% in Q3. This represents a core of a core acceleration revenue growth driven by Mounjaro and the continued strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.7%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. The absence of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q3 2023 and high realized prices partially offset by increases in manufacturing expenses.\nMarketing, sales, and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with new product launches, and additional indications, as well as compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 34%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $2.98 billion, which negatively impacted EPS by $3.29. In Q3 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $62 million or $0.06 of EPS.\nOperating income decreased 71% in Q3 driven by acquired IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher revenue associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 6% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 31 percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 84.6%. This represents an increase of approximately 74 percentage points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges incurred this quarter. Other than the impact of acquired IPR&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously provided guidance.\nAt the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.10 in Q3, a 95% decrease versus Q3 2022, inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and a negative impact of $3.29 from the acquired IPR&D charges.\nOn slide eight, we quantify the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth this quarter. U.S. revenue increased 21% when excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies. U.S. revenue grew 32% driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio, and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 13% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single-digit. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics to have a meaningful impact on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of 2023, which was evident in Q3.\nEurope continued to post robust growth again this quarter excluding revenue from the olanzapine divestiture. Revenue was up 7% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 11% primarily from Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased 16% in constant currency excluding Mounjaro, which had a one-time upfront payment associated with the sales collaboration agreement in the base period. Revenue in Japan decreased 3% in constant currency driven primarily by customer buying patterns related to Emgality. Moving to China, revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth of 25% partially offset by price decline. Volume growth in Q3 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We're encouraged by the growth we have seen this year in China. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 23% in constant currency as volume growth of 28% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, and Jardiance.\nSlide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and gross product categories combined contribute approximately 17 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a headwind of nearly 6 percentage points to volume in Q3. This headwind will abate as COVID-19 antibody sales were minimal after the third quarter of 2022. Lastly, revenue from the sales of rights to the olanzapine portfolio delivered nearly 22 percentage points of growth this quarter.\nSlide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 68% in Q3 driven by robust volume growth. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. As you heard earlier in Q3, Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.\nIn Q3, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline 10% as volume growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower prices driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates in international markets. Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to slide 11, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro revenue grew to just over $1.4 billion globally this quarter, up from $980 million the previous quarter. In Q3, we continue to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro.\nAs of October 1st, access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. reached 78% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 85% access for commercial patients. This expanded access gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As communicated last quarter. Since the $25 non-covered Co-Pay card program expired on June 30th, we now consider all prescriptions paid. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 non-covered Co-Pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered Co-Pay card. We expect Mounjaro net price will continue to benefit from the higher percentage of paid prescriptions, but we'll also continue to face a headwind from more rebated volume as access improves. Looking forward to the end of the year with increased access, we expect to continue to see overall growth in prescription trends.\nIn terms of Mounjaro supply, we're continuing to make progress on our manufacturing expansion agenda. Given strong demand, we continue to experience tight supply throughout most of Q3, which impacted results for the quarter. Most recently, U.S. product shipments have increased and inventory levels at U.S. wholesalers have improved with all doses of Mounjaro now listed as available on the FDA Shortage website.\nWhile supply constraints have eased in the U.S., outside the U.S., Trulicity and outside the U.S., Mounjaro supply remains tight, which materially impacted performance in these regions. With device assembly online at RTP, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling capacity by the end of this year from where we were a year ago and we're gradually increasing production each quarter. We're also continuing to focus on other parts of the supply chain as demand is expected to remain high and production bottlenecks may shift over time.\nAs we mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentation of Mounjaro to reach more patients around the world faster. We have launched with a single-dose vial in Australia and plan to launch in other markets outside the U.S. in the coming weeks and months. The introduction of a single-dose vial presentation in these geographies is intended to serve as a bridge to a multi-dose KwikPen which we expect will be available starting in 2024.\nWe're also preparing for a potential launch of tirzepatide for obesity in the U.S. later this year. Our auto injector capacity and output continues to increase and we look forward to bringing tirzepatide to more patients in the months and years ahead.\nOn slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation in the first nine months of 2023. We invested nearly $12 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments, and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\nSlide 13 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance.\nGuidance for the first four line items including revenue, gross margin, percent marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and R&D expense is unchanged. I would note that we are trending towards the higher end of our estimates for gross margin and the top end of our ranges for operating expense categories. You'll see that we've updated guidance for acquired IPR&D charges, effective tax rate, and EPS to reflect the inclusion of IPR&D charges for completed transactions through Q3 and year-to-date results and equity investments in GAAP guidance. These updates do not include the effect of potential charges associated with pending or future business development transaction. After Q3, we will provide our initial 2024 guidance when we report Q4 results. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nIn R&D. Thanks, Anat. This quarter we had significant pipeline progress as well as a high volume of activity at the major medical congresses where we presented new data on multiple products across all of our therapeutic areas, starting with oncology. Since our last earnings call, we announced top-line results from the LIBRETTO-531 study evaluating Retevmo versus physician's choice of multikinase inhibitors as an initial treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer. As we presented at ESMO, the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 72% improvement in progression-free survival compared to cabozantinib or vandetanib. These data should establish Retevmo as the standard of care for the initial systemic treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and we have work to do to ensure that all of these patients are identified and properly diagnosed.\nWe also shared detailed data from the Phase III LIBRETTO-431 at ESMO in October showing that Retevmo more than doubled progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer. We hope these data, in addition to others recently published for other driver-positive lung cancers, will help accelerate genomic profiling at lung cancer diagnosis to guide initial treatment selection. The results of LIBRETTO-531 and of LIBRETTO-431 were each simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also at ESMO, we shared landmark five-year results from a preplanned interim analysis of the Phase III MonarchE study evaluating Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy compared to endocrine therapy alone in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence.\nThe impact of two years of Verzenio treatment is observed well beyond the treatment period, reducing the risk of long-term recurrence by 32% at 5 years. These data reinforced two years of Verzenio plus endocrine therapy as the standard of care for high-risk early breast cancer patients. Lastly, we shared data on imlunestrant, our oral SERD being studied in phase III as a single agent and in combination therapy. The data shared included the first clinical data for imlunestrant in combination with everolimus or alpelisib, as well as updated monotherapy from the Phase I EMBER study in patients with ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. We hope that imlunestrant could be an important future endocrine therapy backbone in certain settings of breast cancer, and these new data show that the medicine can be safely combined with other agents utilized with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.\nLooking earlier in our oncology pipeline, we shared preclinical data on three of our new pipeline agents at the Triple Meeting on Molecular Targets in Cancer Therapeutics in October. We shared preclinical data for first, a highly potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D that is selective against wild-type KRAS, second, a highly potent and isoform-selective pan-KRAS inhibitor which with activity against a broad spectrum of the most common activating KRAS mutations and high selectivity over wild-type HRAS and NRAS, and third, a fully human monoclonal anti-Nectin-4 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase inhibitor. These programs are among the next slate of oncology agents we expect to enter the clinic over the next year. They represent years of focused work to create potentially differentiated molecules against exacting target product profiles.\nTurning to our diabetes and obesity portfolio in Q3, we announced the FDA approval of Jardiance for treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In the EMPA Kidney phase III trial, Jardiance significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular deaths in adults with CKD. This approval adds to the treatment options for the more than 35 million adults in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease since the last earnings call. We presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-3 phase III clinical trial at the Obesity Week conference in October with the results simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Also in October, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-4 study at EASD. These results will be subsequently published in a top-tier peer-reviewed medical journal.\nData from these phase III trials of tirzepatide showed that participants achieved up to 26.6% total mean weight loss. The detailed results from these studies clearly show the importance of continued therapy for sustained weight management and that if approved, tirzepatide could be an important part of obesity management for those having difficulty maintaining weight loss with diet and exercise alone.\nOur pipeline, as shown on slide 14, now includes a high-dose tirzepatide next in phase II since we have initiated a study exploring higher doses of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Earlier in the pipeline, we presented phase 1 data on muvalaplin at the European Society of Cardiology Congress with simultaneous publication in JAMA. Muvalaplin is the first oral agent specifically developed to lower LP(a) levels. In this phase I study, muvalaplin was well tolerated by participants and resulted in dose-dependent lowering of LP(a) of up to 65%. muvalaplin is currently in phase II as shown on slide 14. We have advanced our SCAP siRNA into phase I for NASH. We've also completed our acquisition of Versanis and now show bimagrumab in phase II. We are excited about the potential combination of bimagrumab and tirzepatide.\nLastly, we're happy to share that since our last earnings call, the retatrutide TRIUMPH Phase III Core Registration Trials are now all actively enrolling to pursue simultaneous indications for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis.\nTurning to our neuroscience portfolio, the FDA has shared with us that the donanemab review will extend into Q1 2024. Needing additional time to complete their review, we've completed submissions in Europe and Japan, and submissions to other global regulatory authorities are either completed or underway. Recently, at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease meeting, we presented new insights from donanemab development program during a symposium session. As part of this symposium, we shared ARIA data from a pooled analysis that included more than 2,000 participants dosed with donanemab and explored ARIA-E association across a number of baseline variables, highlighting a few key factors most strongly associated with ARIA risk, including baseline amyloid levels, evidence of a prior bleed, and high blood pressure. Interestingly, this data also suggested use of antihypertensives decreased the risk of ARIA.\nAdditionally, we shared analyses from our open label addendum of over 1,000 patients treated with donanemab. These results included a post hoc analysis of patients with no brain tau and demonstrated similar or even stronger biomarker results than our main TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. In a separate post hoc analysis from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 phase III study related to activities of daily living and independence in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, we showed that compared to placebo, people treated with donanemab preserved more of their ability to perform many of the items measured, including their ability to make meals, to use appliances, keep appointments, perform pastimes, and be safely left unattended. We also shared an update on our validation data for our plasma P-tau217 test for identifying amyloid-positive patients demonstrating robust performance of this immunoassay.\nWe expect to have this test commercially available in a phased approach first as a laboratory developed test by the end of this year. As you recall, we used plasma P-tau217 to identify presymptomatic individuals for a TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial. This is an event-driven trial, and we've now recruited a sufficient number of qualifying presymptomatic participants and expect to have efficacy results within three years.\nWe're excited to announce today that our otoferlin gene therapy asset from Akouos has begun dosing patients in a phase 1/2 trial for hearing loss.\nIn immunology. As Dave noted, we're happy to have FDA approval for Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This approval offers new hope for patients who are searching for an effective option that can offer rapid and lasting improvements.\nOmvoh will be available to patients in the U.S. in the coming weeks. We were also excited to have the phase III readout for this molecule, mirikizumab, in Crohn's disease. In the VIVID-1 phase III study, mirikizumab met the co-primary and all major secondary endpoints compared to placebo. Mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response for patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease through 52 weeks. We were thrilled to see that more than half of participants on mirikizumab achieved clinical remission at one year and that robust efficacy was seen in both participants who are naive to biological therapy as well as participants who previously failed a prior biologic therapy. Helping patients achieve long-term clinical remission is a key goal for us in our pursuit of treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.\nThese new data in Crohn's disease build on the high levels of long term remission seen with mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis and help reinforce the differentiation of this important potential medicine. This successful phase III trial will be the basis of global regulatory submissions for Crohn's disease. As Dave noted earlier in Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab based on findings at a third party manufacturer. In Q3 we completed the acquisition of DICE and now reflect the two oral IL-17 assets, DICE853, and DICE806, in phase I and phase II of our pipeline respectively. Additionally, two new molecules began phase II studies in immunology this quarter. First, our CD200R monoclonal antibody known as Eusirprobart for atopic dermatitis, and second, our RIPK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We've removed our BTLA monoclonal antibody agonist from phase II in our pipeline.\nAfter the phase 2a study failed to demonstrate efficacy.\nQ3 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nRemarks. Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q and A, let me briefly sum up our progress. In the third quarter, this quarter, revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum, of course led by Mounjaro. Excluding revenue from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and the sale of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue grew 24%, driven again by Mounjaro, Verzenio, as well as Jardiance. By continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, and early-phase capabilities, as well as in business development, we are confident that we have positioned ourselves for growth now and in the coming years. With the opportunity for continued margin expansion.\nWe achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approval of Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well as Jardiance for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, and the positive phase III VIVID-1 results for mirikizumab for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Looking forward, we are expecting regulatory responses before the end of the year on our submissions for pirtobrutinib in accelerated approval and CLL, as well as tirzepatide for obesity. In Q3, we completed several targeted acquisitions intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio. Directly following the quarter, we also announced an agreement to acquire Point Biopharma, which will further expand our R&D capabilities in oncology. Lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend.\nA few weeks ago we announced several leadership changes. Mike Mason, our Executive Vice President and President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, will retire from the company at the end of 2023 after 34 years. With Lilly in his current role, Mike has overseen tirzepatide's late-stage development and an unprecedented type 2 diabetes launch. Mike leaves behind an enduring legacy that reflects his deep compassion for patients and his commitment to our people. With this being Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him for his many years of outstanding service to Lilly and wish him all the best in his next chapter of life.\nPatrik Jonsson will assume leadership of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity in addition to his current responsibilities as President of Lilly USA, and Dan Skovronsky, our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Research Labs, will take on the additional role of President of Lilly Immunology from Patrik, and in a related move, David Hyman is assuming the role of Chief Medical Officer for the company from Dan, overseeing the full Lilly portfolio. Leigh Ann Pusey, our Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications, has decided to leave the company at the end of 2023. Leigh Ann has left a lasting impact on Lilly and the patients we serve, and we're grateful for her many contributions over the past six years.\nSo as we begin this new chapter of growth for our company, we are very confident that our deep experience of our leadership team will allow us to continue to accelerate our efforts to make medicines and be more effective and more innovative in the years ahead. So now let me turn the call over to Joe, and he'll moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. So, consistent with last quarter, we'll respond to one question per caller, so ask that you limit to one question per caller, as we'll aim to end the call at 10:00AM. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue, and we'll get to your question if time allows.\nPaul, please provide the instructions for the Q and A session and.\nWe're ready for the first.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today's call. If you do have a follow-up question, please rejoin the queue by pressing star one after that at any time. We also ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we poll for questions.\nThe first question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is.\nLive.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharamceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much. I have a question on obesity and.\nPersistence on therapy, which I think has been a big question mark. I know you haven't formally launched yet, but guessing you might have some idea, a best guess if nothing else. So, in your view, is this going to be like most other drug categories where persistence on therapy is often low? I think the rule of thumb is that at the one year mark, 50% of patients drop off chronic medicines. So really the question is if you took 100 patients who start on one of these contemporary obesity drugs, how many of that initial hundred would likely still be on therapy? Let's say three or four or five years down the.\nRoad.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Mike, would you like to weigh in on the persistence of therapy on?\nObesity?\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll first answer. With the data that we do have, it was hard to speculate on what it's going to be for obesity. You know, the best data we have for tirzepatide is in type 2 diabetes patients who started Mounjaro prior to our savings card changes last fall. Mounjaro's persistency for those patients is tracking higher than those patients that were started on Trulicity and Ozempic over that same period of time. So while it's too early to project the average length of therapy or how many out of 100 will still be on therapy after a couple of years, I think that this early data is encouraging. You know, as for bcd, you know, time was going to tell.\nI think, you know, we've all looked at Wegovy data, but I don't think this is the right benchmark at this point because of Novo supply constraints and.\nThere's been just a very dynamic market. You know, I think as you said, you know, this, you know, having persistency on a chronic treatment isn't just an issue for anti-obesity medications. You know, it's a goal for all chronic treatments. Now I think what's different about obesity is that on many chronic treatments, consumers don't feel differently or experience any acute impacts from stopping treatments. So what we've seen in the SURMOUNT clinical trials with tirzepatide is that some consumers will feel their appetite increase and experience weight regain when they stop tirzepatide. And so this should help reinforce treatment adherence. Seeing in our market research how important it is for people who live with obesity to lose weight and maintain it, I do think you're gonna see just a high motivation that people have lost weight, that they do wanna maintain it.\nWe do know from our SURMOUNT program that chronic use of tirzepatide is a good component, an important component of maintaining weight loss. So, it's too early to project it, but I do think there's things that's rolling in favor of tirzepatide having a good length of therapy in the obesity.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Next.\nQuestion. Paul,\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is.\nLive.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGreat, thanks so much for the question. So I really wanted to drill into orforglipron and those phase III programs. You know, Dan, I was just hoping that you could clarify for the market.\nIf there's any monitoring in that study related to liver enzyme elevations, I think there was one case in the phase II diabetes study that you conducted. Just wanted to know if there's any related concerns associated with that or if this is kind of as expected, you know.\nAn all-hands-on-deck, moving-forward opportunity. Thanks.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Seamus. Yeah, I like the way you phrase it. All hands on deck, moving forward on orforglipron. We're really excited about this molecule in terms of, you know, liver safety. I think we commented before that what we saw in phase II is what, you know, we thought would probably be typical for.\nA trial of that nature in this population. So not a heightened level of concern, but always concerned about safety going into phase III from a variety of factors including for all small molecules, especially.\nLiver function. So it's routine in our phase III studies across the portfolio to monitor liver function, and I'm sure we're doing that in orforglipron, but not aware of any special precautions there. So super excited that that program's going.\nFast.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThanks Dan.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nPaul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is.\nLive.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much for taking the questions. Anat, you had mentioned shifting the date of your 2024 guidance early next year. Just want to know what drove that change, and if you can assure us that there are no issues with the tirzepatide obesity review and or manufacturing. Thank.\nYou.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure. So let me first start with reassuring you that there are no issues behind our decision to move the guidance date to or have it aligned with our Q4 earnings call. What it does do is it does help us have the year-end full results when we provide guidance for 2024. So previously, if we didn't have that, investors had to look at guidance range for the year and estimates based on midpoints, et cetera. This does enable us to close the year and then have a full view into 2024. It is aligned with our internal planning processes as well, and obviously is the way most companies, and I believe all companies in our industry, do that. So nothing unique going into that other than just having the full data set for.\n2023.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Anat Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. And my question is regarding the P-tau217 biomarker data you have shown at CTAD. Seems like the predictability is getting to 94% with these tests. Even C2N was pretty good. So do you have any thoughts on at this point, how close are we to actually make this bring this to prime time? And when donanemab gets approved, do you think this could be the test doctors use or it would still take some time to get.\nTo.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks Mohit for the question. You broke up a little bit there, but I think we got the gist. I'll hand off to Anne.\n\nAnne White\n\nPresident of Lilly Neuroscience, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYes, as we shared at CTAD, we were pleased with the data that we saw, and we're also pleased to see progress across the field in blood biomarkers. We definitely believe that this is incredibly important to drive access and early diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease. So you've seen us invest in a number of fronts: our own P-tau217, but also partnering with others who are working on good tests to elevate the area. So it's a strategy of raising all boats. But yes, we did share our data, and we intend to make this available in a phased approach commercially as an LDT starting at the end of this year in a couple of sites and then continuing to expand over 2024. But at the same time, you'll see us continue to publish the data.\nWe think that what's incredibly important in the field is that good correlated data, particularly with amyloid PET, which is the gold standard for diagnosis, is published and shared so that we can continue to make sure that we have high quality tests out there. So that's part of our goal with delivering this test, is to really set a standard for what blood tests should look like. So look forward to hearing more over the next coming months as we publish that data and then make that more broadly.\nAvailable.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anne. Thanks, Mohit for the question. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you, do you think the approval of additional oral diabetes drug could impact the pricing for injectables? Why or why not? Thank.\nYou.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Louise, for the question. I'll hand over to Mike about the potential approval for other oral diabetes drugs and potential impact on.\nInjectables.\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nNo, I don't think that'll have an impact. I mean, traditionally we don't see a new class of diabetes agents coming in and affecting a current class. Usually the competition happens within a specific class within the diabetes.\nMarket.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff, your line is.\nLive.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning.\nEveryone. Thanks for the.\nJust had one on tirzepatide supply. I know you guys have, you know, a plan in North Carolina and another one coming online next year. But, you know, if you look beyond that, if you have demand anywhere near what's modeled and even outside of obesity and diabetes, you know, obviously supply could remain tight. So the question is, is there a threshold of treated patients, like, in the near term, that will inform your, your decision on adding manufacturing capacity and how much does the outlook for orforglipron have on.\nThat? Thank.\nYou.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Geoff, for the question. I'll hand over to David.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Geoff. Obviously, hot topic. We work on this multiple hours every day. You're citing the announcements we've made, and, as Anat mentioned, we made great progress this year on manufacturing agenda. RTP is sort of on track to deliver on its goal as we exit the year, and then that kind of in market volume following that. Concord, which is a few hours away, kind of a replica site, also well on track for coming online in 2024.\nSo that's good news in the IRMAA presentation, which is what we call our auto-injector that you know from Trulicity and the current presentation from Mounjaro in the U.S. We've announced previously that we're introducing now a single-use vial presentation ex-U.S. so that we aren't basically sitting on approvals and can have patients have access to the medication that will follow then by a multi-use injector that uses different property plant equipment than what we're talking about here. So a couple things to point out. You're noting kind of new greenfield site expansions we've rightfully made a big deal out of. We're not done with those. I think you might hear more about that in the future. Of course we are aggressively planning that and not banking on orforglipron to rescue us from this.\nWe think that there is a need to take up parenteral incretin supply pretty dramatically from the current levels, and we plan to do that. But that will be in a combination of the current syringe-based auto injector, the vial capacity. We've already talked about the multi-use injector, which will come online sometime next year and is a highly efficient play for us because it uses current systems and different ones from the auto injector. And then there's third-party agreements that have been ongoing in the background. And to point out here, we're not relying on one. We have a diverse portfolio of third parties, recognizing that the probability of full supply from any one is probably less than 1, but buying up as much capacity as available in all those systems. So we've got, I think, the all hands on deck phrase was used earlier.\nI mean, this is really all hands on deck, and it's a problem we work on every day. So we're not at all happy with the capacity we've announced already. You'll see more. Some we don't announce that will just layer into the volume we ship. And of course long term new.\nPresentations like solid oral opens up even more possibilities. But we need to do everything we can now, given the huge potential for global obesity treatment, for our medicines to play a key role in that, and then ultimately impact hundreds of millions of people. So a lot of work to do here yet ahead. Thanks for the question,\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nPaul. Next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is from Laura Hindley from Berenberg. Laura, your line is.\nLive.\n\nLaura Hindley\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Berenberg\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So I think it's clear from your results that the mix shift to Mounjaro is rapidly in progress. But how should we think about the ex-U.S. Trulicity contribution going forward, which did look weak this quarter but at the moment you're still supply restricted? Can we expect a return to growth into next year as constraints ease or should we now assume Trulicity is ex-growth as you push the shift into Mounjaro? Thank.\nYou.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Laura. For the question, I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International. Ilya, do you want to address Trulicity ex-U.S. contributions in the quarter and going.\nForward?\n\nIlya Yuffa\n\nPresident of Lily International, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure, yeah. First, thanks for the question. Listen, I think from a Trulicity standpoint we had healthy growth coming into.\nLater part of last year, and we've been pretty transparent with both physicians, as well as regulators, that due to tight supply we encourage not to start new patients. We continue with that to be transparent. We think that's the right thing to do. As we think about growth in incretin, we're looking as we build up capacity, as David mentioned.\nAs we increase capacity both in the single-use vial and introduce Mounjaro in additional markets as we have in Australia and will continue over the next number of weeks and months in other markets, and then transition towards a multi-use platform of KwikPen in introducing Mounjaro. So the overall growth in incretin will be mainly driven by as we are able to launch Mounjaro in new markets; that's probably where we'll get the growth. Thank you for the.\nQuestion.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks Ilya. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is.\nLive.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I realize Mounjaro is not approved in obesity yet, but I'm just very curious how you're thinking about the pros and cons heading into that pricing decision, if there is any, because Novo does have that price premium, as you know, on Wegovy over Ozempic. So on the one hand while Mounjaro price could be the same because the dose is the same, but on the other hand Novo has this dynamic where it can offer a lot more rebate for the obesity indication than you can if you leave the price unchanged. I'm just curious what your thought process is heading into.\nThat.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nI'll hand over to.\nMike.\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Obviously we're not going to talk about price prior to approval. We're evaluating every scenario. We'll make the right decision for patients who live with obesity.\nThanks.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nPaul. Next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink. David, your line is.\nLive.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director of Biopharma, Leerink\n\nYes, thanks very much, and thanks.\nFor all the updates today. Some major payers seem to underappreciate the broad health savings potential that incretins offer.\nThe non-diabetic obese population and instead focus on criticizing drug pricing. So ahead of the results from Mounjaro's morbidity and mortality outcomes trial in.\n2027, how does Lilly plan to better?\nInform payers about Mounjaro's health economics benefits in non-diabetic obese.\nPatients? Thanks very much.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave, for the question. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about that? About the longer term appreciation for the broader health benefits of medicines like.\ntirzepatide?\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company",
    "content2": "Yeah, no, David, it's a good question. One that we've obviously spent a ton of time on and done a lot of internal analysis and a lot of planning on. We will have a whole suite of real-world evidence and pragmatic trials so that we can answer this question clearly for payers and other stakeholders. You know, in our conversations with payers, you know, while they're concerned about the short term, you know, budget impact, they do understand that.\nLosing weight will have benefits. You know, it's not that hard of a sale cause they do understand the benefits are intuitive. If you look at the total number of obesity-related complications, there's over 200. And you look at some of these are just really devastating and very costly like type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and then when you look at the cost of these, in the U.S. alone, there's $370 billion in direct medical costs associated with obesity-related comorbidities and over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs. When payers see that people living with obesity and overweight drive 2.7x greater healthcare costs than normal weight individuals, that data does get their attention. And so I think over time we'll continue to provide health economics data. But also I think the voice of those living with obesity will be very important in this.\nThis is a disease that.\nReally materially impacts someone's both health and mental functioning and is really important for people who live with obesity. Their goal is to lose weight and maintain that so they can help their long-term health benefits, and they're going to have a loud voice in this I think both in commercial insurance as well as in states and the federal government. So I do, I am confident over time that we will see increase in access. I think the most recent report shows that there's 50 million people in the U.S. that has access to obesity medications. So it will take time but I do think more and more payers are appreciating the value that anti-obesity medications especially when we get approval for tirzepatide we'll offer them.\nThanks.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you Mike. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is.\nLive.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, thank you so much for giving me the question and congrats on the progress. So given the executive changes announced in October, how should we think about.\nThe direction of the immunology business now with Dan at the helm? Thank you.\nGuys.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan. Dave, do you want to take that?\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSure, I can start and let Dan comment. Look, we've been really pleased with this business, which I think it's important to take the long view here. I mean I was involved in creating this like 10 years ago, and both Taltz, Emgality, and now mirikizumab, and hopefully soon lebrikizumab, will form a really core portfolio for us. You know, really exploiting ideas that we had some time ago. You know what's next, and you see here today advancing another checkpoint agonist into phase II is a lot of decisions about okay, what's next to take immunology to the next level.\nAnd that's largely going to be about key decisions, both internal portfolio and potentially externally, like with our DICE acquisition, to find a new set of either single agent or combinations that can raise the standard of care in tough immunology diseases, noting in particular in IBD and RA. The standard of care is hardly satisfied today. We measure pretty low performance status as success. So that's the mission that Dan and we've hired Mark Genovese to the company and others to really build the portfolio of the future. I don't know Dan, if you.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nI'm very excited about the opportunity. There's lots of work to do in immunology given the depth of unmet medical needs, and the science is breaking here. So, I hope we can continue to bring great drugs to market as we're doing with mirikizumab and we hope to do with lebrikizumab soon and more to.\nCome.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Evan, for the question. Next.\nQuestion.\nPaul,\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is.\nLive.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks so.\nJust as we're thinking about the upcoming tirzepatide obesity approval, just interested in your perspective of how we should anticipate commercial coverage ramping as we think of maybe the first couple quarters post launch versus where it could be in a year or two from now, just how quickly can we think about coverage coming on board? Thank you.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Chris. I'll hand over to Mike to comment on anticipation of commercial coverage over time.\nMike?\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, no, it's a good question. It will ramp up. We'll, you know, we're trying to be disciplined, and we're trying to make sure that we bring on access as quickly as is prudent. And so, just like we did with Mounjaro, we'll take and make sure that we sometimes access has to materialize at an organic pace where it makes sense, and we'll make sure and use our judgment. So, just like with Mounjaro, while we'd love to get out of the gate quickly, most, most importantly as a setup for long-term success. So, you'll see kind of a natural ramp up that you would with, with any new product.\nI think it's important, you know, as you look in, you know, the first quarter of our launch, you know, last January when you saw Wegovy resupply, they were resupplying into a market where they already had capacity. I think when you look at our access and you look at our volume as we head into next year, you'll see a ramp up in volume as you see a ramp up in our.\nAccess.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is.\nLive.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Question on why Lilly is evaluating higher doses of tirzepatide. There is risk an adverse event is uncovered and taints the franchise. And of course, there are IRA considerations.\nDoes this suggest some reservation about the pipeline? Either triple G or orforglipron, the former which has safety signals, the latter of which took five years to get to phase III. It would also be interesting to know whether it's the exact same molecule or it's been enhanced in some way. Thank.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Steve, for the question.\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, I'll take all of that. I think. I'm not sure exactly what the safety signals you're referring to on retatrutide, I think, but we're excited about both retatrutide and orforglipron, which are both in phase III and both advancing quickly. We've invested quite a lot in those phase III programs. They're robust, covering multiple indications, so there's no hesitation or trepidation there at all. I think though, you know, notwithstanding those two molecules, which I expect to be great and important, you know, contributors to human health.\nWe have tirzepatide. I'm not exactly sure if we've maximized the dose response. If we hit the flat part of the dose response curve yet. It looked like we might be close, but we want to explore it. And so we're testing the higher doses in phase II. I think we've had enough patients on this drug for long enough that, that I expect the risk of uncovering a new safety signal with sort of marginally higher doses is extremely low. So not worried about that at.\nAll.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nMaybe just jump in here because we have questions like this, and you know, we have a number of research projects in obesity and related mechanisms, and some people ask, well, how does this one affect that? Or whatever. That's not really the mindset in which we're pursuing this. We're, we see ourselves as a leader in this space and have a unique opportunity, and our goal is to exploit every single idea until we get data that says we shouldn't. And so high dose tirzepatide is just another version of that, but it doesn't have a read through to other things. We're just in all the above mode in obesity.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is.\nLive.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank.\nYou. Good.\nMorning. In about a week or so, we'll get detailed results from the Select Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial at the American Heart meeting. Can you share with us what perhaps three key questions that the Lilly team will be looking at when we get detailed?\nResults?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDan, do you want to weigh in?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOh, I don't know. I could start. Maybe Mike has some to add here. Look, I'm excited to see that data, of course, as everyone else is, but the top line looked good for me. I think we're sort of creating now data points on a line that connect the level of weight loss with the degree of cardiovascular benefit. I think this point fits on that line reasonably well. That line, which shows greater health benefits, including better, fewer MACE outcomes.\nWith greater degrees of weight loss, bodes very well for Mounjaro data, given the very high degrees of weight loss that we saw in our trials. I'll leave it at that. See if Mike wants to.\nAdd.\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, probably the key question I'm looking at is like, how much of the effect was driven by drug effect versus weight loss is probably the key question we're looking.\nAt.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan and Mike.\nPaul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is.\nLive.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst and Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good.\nMorning.\nFollowing on the prior question, but maybe more on sort of the.\nImpact of the flow data and, you know, your thoughts there. Specifically, you guys have taken sort of a different approach with your more recent assets there in terms of targeting that population. Is Lilly's view that those benefits will accrue to the class, and maybe just talk about how you think about targeting that segment down the.\nRoad. Thank.\nYou.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Carter, for the question. Dan, do you want to comment on the flow.\nData?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah. So you're asking here about kidney disease. I think the profound effect that incretins seem to be having on the kidney is really a nice and important additive benefit here.\nThis is something that's been observed with multiple class members now and they expect it will extend into our incretins as well. So it's exciting and I think proof that these drugs, perhaps in addition to weight loss and A1C control, could have other direct metabolic benefits, including the.\nKidney.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nPaul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is.\nLive.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nMorning all. Thanks for squeezing me in just one on Mounjaro U.S. pricing. So by our calculations, we think at Q3 2023, the net price is around.\n$440 per TRX for the rest of the.\nYeah. Do you think that net price can continue to go up and above the savings card price of $450? Are there payers wanting to pay for this or is this broadly capped now until that savings card ends and for next year? Can you just give us your thoughts on if net price can meaningfully keep increasing?\nThanks.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Trung. Mike, do you want to make any comments around.\nManjaro.\nPricing?\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, no, I'd be happy to do that. You know, I think maybe at a macro level, I would say that our gross-to-net for Mounjaro in Q3 kind of normalized. You know, before then we had a number of savings card changes that, you know, made our gross-to-net rate, you know, dynamic. Our last.\ncard change occurred late in.\nQ2, so at the end of June. And so Q3 was a kind of a pure quarter where we didn't have any other Co-Pay card changes. And I would say that our Mounjaro rate normalized at that point. You know, going forward, I think what you'll see is what you see normally for a product at this point in the life cycle, that as we pursue gaining access, there'll probably be some pricing pressure related to that. But we don't have any other Co-Pay card changes planned in the near.\nFuture.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Paul, next.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator 3\n\nThe next question is coming from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn, your line is.\nLive.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking your question. This is Nicole on from Robyn, just going back to obesity. How are you thinking through the impact on Mounjaro if IRA stays and Wegovy and Ozempic prices decline in the 2026, 2027.\nTimeframe?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks Nicole, for the question. I think if I heard you right, you're thinking about IRA impacts to maybe semaglutide and potential impacts to Mounjaro. Mike, do you want to comment on that.\nBriefly?\n\nMike Mason\n\nPresident of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, no, I'm happy to do that. You know, obviously it's too early to really impact how IRA will have an impact and the impact it will have in other products within the class. I think what's important for tirzepatide is it is the first dual-acting incretin and we do think it has a unique profile and in head-to-head results in type 2 diabetes, it did show superior both A1C and weight to semaglutide. And so at the end of the day I think the profile of the product will carry the day and obviously more to come the IRA as.\nThe first products go through the negotiation. We see the impact, but we're confident in the profile of our tirzepatide.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Mike. Paul, I think we have two calls left in the queue. Why don't we go through those two quickly, and then we'll wrap.\nUp.\n\nOperator 3\n\nCertainly the first one is a follow up from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is.\nLive.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOh great. Thanks for the follow-up question. So, you know, just in terms of how you're thinking about the introduction of oral treatments and the importance of pushing for what would be hopefully a maintenance type regimen. Is Lilly, you know, looking at oral therapies as more of a maintenance regimen opportunity or do you see a broader opportunity here perhaps bringing in other mechanisms that perhaps could aid in pursuing I guess the ever elusive metabolic set.\nPoint?\nThanks.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nDan. Do you want to comment on?\nThat?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, thanks Seamus. Maybe to paraphrase Dave's previous answer is sort of an all of the above here. I think there's great opportunities on the oral as a standalone therapy for initiation of therapy also. Yes, for maintenance therapy globally and also yes, for potential combinations. You know, I point out the obvious fact that this is a GLP-1 monotherapy. So we benchmark it against the best injectable GLP-1 monotherapy. But I don't expect as an oral it will achieve the same levels of efficacy we can see with dual agonism like tirzepatide. So the future certainly will hold combinations like that. Thank.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAnd last question, Paul from the.\nQueue.\n\nOperator 3\n\nCertainly, the last question will be a follow up from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is.\nLive.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharamceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. What's the latest thinking on the topic of GIP agonism versus antagonism? So tirzepatide is the former, Amgen's drug is the latter. I've never seen two drugs in any category that have a similar clinical effect, but opposing underlying activity. The biologic drug target Amgen says GIP antagonism is the way to go, supported by their genetic analyses. What does Lilly think? Have you looked similarly at genetic analyses to inform your.\nView?\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Tim, for the last question.\nDan?\n\nDan Skovronsky\n\nChief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nYeah, I'll take that. Of course we have now, I think, more data on GIP agonism than anyone in the world. Starting with tirzepatide of course, which is a combo GLP-1 GIP agonist, and the head-to-head study against a pure GLP-1 agonist. You can see some profoundly different effects here. Looking at, for example, efficacy relative to tolerability, it looks like the GIP is boosting efficacy while also reducing the side effects that limit tolerability. So that was our initial evidence in human trials that involved. Well, now tens of thousands of patients have been on tirzepatide in trials, and then we went out to sort of prove this point by creating a pure GIP agonist that just agonizes GIP to see what that could do alone.\nAnd again we saw a very highly tolerated drug consistent with what we understand about the mechanism of GLP-1 that probably could suppress, actually, nausea and vomiting that led to weight loss. So I think human data trumps everything here and we've got a ton of that. So we're pretty excited about GIP agonism. I can't really say what will happen with antagonism, but like you said, it's pretty unusual to have opposing mechanisms both work in similar.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan, for the last one, Dave.\n\nDave Ricks\n\nChair and CEO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay, thanks, Joe. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and, of course, your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly and Company. As I said, it's been a very productive year for Lilly so far, and we look forward to continuing this momentum through a busy end of year and fourth quarter. So, thanks for dialing in today. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we did not address on the call, and hope everyone has a great rest of the week and rest of the day today.

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.\nAs we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn over the call to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks, Joe. In the second quarter, Lilly's momentum continued. We advanced our R&D pipeline, progressed our ambitious manufacturing agenda and delivered strong financial results. Our business saw an acceleration of revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. As base period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue and Alimta's loss of exclusivity recede, we do expect strong growth to continue in the quarters ahead.\nLilly has made substantial progress in advancing our pipeline of innovative medicines in recent years, but the past few months have been particularly noteworthy. In early May, we shared the top line results of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed donanemab treatment slowed clinical decline in Alzheimer's by 35%. While differences in enrollment criteria and study design make cross-trial comparisons difficult, this represents the greatest percentage cognitive slowing in a primary end point of any disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment reported to date and the only Phase II to Phase III replication to date.\n3 weeks ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we shared the detailed results, including new analysis, which demonstrates the potential of even greater cognitive slowing in patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.\nAt the ADA scientific sessions in June, we shared positive Phase II data on 2 next-generation diabetes and obesity product candidates: orforglipron and retatrutide. And less than 2 weeks ago, we shared top line results from the SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 Phase III trials, which showed participants on tirzepatide following intensive lifestyle intervention or with continued tirzepatide treatment achieved up to 26.6% mean weight loss. Dan will share more perspectives in his R&D update on these and other exciting areas of pipeline progress.\nMoving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the continued progress made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Excluding revenue from BAQSIMI and from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, Q2 revenue grew 22% on 23% volume growth. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, which leads our new products category. That category also includes Jaypirca and now Evo, which saw its first sales in Japan in Q2 and launched in Germany in July.\nIn the second quarter of this year, new products and growth products categories combined contributed approximately 26 percentage points of volume growth. These products, coupled with potential upcoming launches, solidify Lilly's strong growth profile through this decade.\nWe've had several important pipeline updates since our Q1 earnings call: for mirikizumab, approval in the EU and resubmission of our U.S. application with regulatory action expected by the end of this year; regulatory submissions in the U.S. for tirzepatide for chronic weight management; regulatory submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA following the positive Phase III results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial; and positive Phase III top line readouts for SURMOUNT-3 and 4 in the third and fourth global studies evaluating tirzepatide in chronic weight management.\nThe second quarter also was productive for business development. We've commented in the past on our active exploration and pursuit of external innovation and are pleased to have announced agreements to acquire 2 clinical-stage companies in the second quarter: Dice Therapeutics and VersanisBio. These companies operate in different therapeutic areas, and each is a fit with Lilly's strategy.\nWe also closed the sale of global rights to BAQSIMI, and the financial impact of this transaction is reflected in our Q2 results. After quarter end, we closed the sale of rights to our olanzapine portfolio, which will be reflected in our Q3 financial results. Both these transactions are now incorporated into our updated 2023 financial guidance.\nWe continued to progress the most ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda in the 147 history of our company. We're happy to share that commercial production to support our incretin portfolio has begun at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. Beyond the capacity expansion that will come as we ramp production at this site, we're also pursuing other near-term paths to expand access to our incretins to patients around the world. Anat will provide more detail on these efforts.\nAnd finally, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we're sharing today.\nSo without further ado, I'll turn this over to Anat to share our Q2 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments today on non-GAAP performance. In Q2, revenue increased 28% versus Q2 of 2022. Excluding revenue from BAQSIMI and from COVID-19 antibodies in the base period, revenue increased 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This acceleration in our revenue growth was achieved despite lingering headwinds from Alimta's loss of exclusivity in the United States, which occurred in the first half of last year, and the effects of which should normalize going forward.\nGross margin as a percent of revenue was flat in Q2 at 79.8%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from product mix, including onetime revenue from the sales of rights to BAQSIMI, which was offset by increases in manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and our investments in capacity expansion.\nTotal operating expenses increased 14% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18% driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming new product launches and additional indications. R&D expenses increased 32% driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research.\nThis quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $97 million or $0.09 of EPS. In Q2 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $440 million or $0.46 of EPS. Operating income increased 69% in Q2 driven by higher revenue, including revenue associated with the sales of rights for BAQSIMI and lower IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 27% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 115 basis points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges.\nOur Q2 effective tax rate was 16.1%. This represents an increase of 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 driven by the impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime in the sales of rights for BAQSIMI. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.11 in Q2, a 69% increase versus Q2 of 2022, inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sales of rights for BAQSIMI.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue increased 41%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and BAQSIMI, U.S. revenue grew 30% driven by robust growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 2% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by low single digits, consistent with prior trends.\nAs I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we expect Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics to have an even greater effect on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of this year.\nEurope continued its growth trajectory with revenue in Q2 up 6% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 12% in the second quarter. For Japan, Q2 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as we continue to see robust growth in our newer medicine, led by Verzenio, and to a lesser extent, Jardiance, Olumiant and Mounjaro, the last of which launched in Japan in April.\nMoving to China. Revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth only minimally offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by TiVos and Verzenio. We are pleased to see our China business return to growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 19% in constant currency as volume growth of 20% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.\nSlide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you may recall, on our Q1 earnings call, we simplified the categorization of our products with a focus on 2 categories: new products and growth products. As you can see, the new and growth categories combined contributed 26 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The volume growth for all others category was driven by the sale of rights to BAQSIMI. The lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a milder headwind to growth in Q2 compared to Q1 and will continue to be a modest impact to prior year comparisons.\nSlide 10 provides additional perspectives across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 57% in Q2 as OUS volume grew 82%, while U.S. volume grew 47%. Jardiance also continued its strong performance with worldwide sales growth of 45% for the quarter.\nThere have been 2 notable regulatory approval for Jardiance in the last 2 months. In June, the FDA approved Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children 10 years and older, making Jardiance the first and only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for this patient population. And in late July, Jardiance was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease. After almost a decade on the market, Jardiance continues to demonstrate its importance to patients across a number of cardiorenal metabolic conditions.\nTrulicity performance has held up well in a growing and dynamic incretin market. In Q2, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline by 5% as modest volume growth was more than offset by price erosion. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to initiate patients on Trulicity. We remain confident that Trulicity will continue to be an important option for HCPs and patients in years to come.\nMoving to Slide 11. I will share some perspective on Mounjaro's performance. We continue to be pleased with the strong momentum of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro's revenue in the U.S. grew to $960 million for the quarter. In Q2, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro, and access reached 73% on July 1 for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts from Mounjaro in Q2 was approximately 67%, up from approximately 55% in Q1.\nAs a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 noncovered co-pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay card program expired in June 30, we would expect the proportion of paid script next quarter to be 100% under this definition. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect continued growth in new-to-brand prescription as well as ongoing improvement in access.\nLastly, regarding the demand and supply outlook for incretin. We're pleased that commercial production has started at our RTP site in North Carolina. Even as we ramp up capacity at RTP, we believe supply will likely remain tight in the coming months and quarters due to significant demand.\nGiven the expected global demand for tirzepatide, as we mentioned on previous earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentations to bring tirzepatide to more patients faster. To this end, we initiated a bioequivalent study in early April for a multi-dose quick pen device. In many OUS markets, we expect to launch tirzepatide first in vial form later this year and transition to a multi-dose quick pen as approved and available in these markets starting in 2024. The launch of the vial and quick pen presentations for tirzepatide will leverage existing manufacturing assets and capacity. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the number of people we can help in the short term and long term with these additional options.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first 6 months of 2023, we invested $5.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\nSlide 3 (sic) [ Slide 13 ] presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Given the strong performance in our underlying business as well as revenue from the sales of rights for BAQSIMI and olanzapine, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance by $2.2 billion to a range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activities, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and BAQSIMI, while the remainder reflects strong underlying business performance.\nOur updated FX assumptions based on recent spot rates are listed and represents a de minimis impact to the updated guidance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue has increased to approximately 80% driven by the sales of rights for BAQSIMI and our olanzapine portfolio.\nWe're also increasing the range of operating expense guidance for the year. Marketing, selling and administrative costs are now expected to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with the increase driven by additional investments in recent launches in preparation for launches of new medicine and line extensions expected later this year.\nThe range for research and development expenses has been increased to $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion, reflecting positive dynamics across our portfolio, including success in events in our early-stage assets, positive enrollment trends in our late-stage studies, broadening of the clinical program for next-generation incretin, and expected incremental expenses from business development activities.\nWe have incorporated IPR&D charges that have been incurred through Q2 2023, which totaled $202 million. Other income and expense and tax rate guidance have also been updated. OID is now expected to be between $0 million and $100 million in income, up from prior guidance of $100 million to $200 million in expense. We've also increased our estimated effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, up from approximately 13%, reflecting the impact of the sales of rights for our olanzapine portfolio and BAQSIMI.\nBased on these changes, we have raised our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share and raised our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Scientific Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks, Anat. It's been a productive and busy few months for Lilly R&D. Since our last earnings call, we've had a few major readouts across our therapeutic areas, and we've announced several business development transactions. Let me start with the data that we shared in June at the American Diabetes Association. We presented over 40 abstracts across our portfolio and shared data during 2 ADA-sponsored symposia.\nThe first was for the Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-2 study of tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight in type 2 diabetes, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the second symposium was for the results from 2 Phase II trials of retatrutide, our GIP/GLP glucagon tri-agonist in adults with obesity and overweight as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. The retatrutide results in obesity and type 2 diabetes were simultaneously published in New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, respectively.\nWe also shared an oral presentation on our Phase II trial results for orforglipron, our once-daily, non-peptide oral GLP-1 in adults with obesity or overweight. These results were simultaneously published in New England Journal. We also presented results from a Phase II trial of orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these were published in the Lancet. Clearly, we're proud of all of this data in diabetes and obesity portfolio.\nSince we discussed the top line data for SURMOUNT-2 tirzepatide trial during our last earnings call, I'll focus my updates today on the Phase II data shared for orforglipron and retatrutide, starting with orforglipron on Slide 14. The orforglipron presentation highlighted safety and efficacy data across 6 dose arms in our Phase II study in obesity. With an overall mean body weight at baseline of 109 kilograms, orforglipron demonstrated an average of up to 14.7% body weight reduction at 36 weeks.\nAt the second highest dose tested in the study, 75% of participants reached a weight reduction goal of 10% or more. We also shared data showing a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure and an overall improvement in lipid levels. The most common adverse events were GI-related and generally occurred earlier in the trial during the titration phase and were mostly mild to moderate. While we've not yet shared the dosing details for our Phase III studies, these Phase II results have informed our approach on dose escalation.\nWe also presented data at ADA from a similar Phase II study of orforglipron in people with type 2 diabetes, the results of which are highlighted on Slide 15. Orforglipron demonstrated a mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c at 26 weeks of up to 2.1%, and over 90% of participants on the highest 3 doses achieved A1c levels less than 7%. We initiated Phase III trials for orforglipron in both obesity and type 2 diabetes in the second quarter, and we look forward to those results in 2025.\nFor retatrutide, the full results of 2 Phase II trials were presented during an ADA-sponsored symposium, which discussed efficacy and safety in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. There's also a segment of the symposium focused on liver fat and NASH-related biomarker data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which showed relative liver fat reduction of over 80% at 24 weeks for the [ 2 ] is doses.\nSlide 16 highlights key results from the obesity Phase II trial in which retatrutide met the primary end point at 24 weeks, demonstrating mean weight reduction up to 17.5%. The safety profile of retatrutide was similar to other incretin-based therapies. In a secondary end point of weight reduction at 48 weeks, participants treated with the highest dose of retatrutide demonstrated a mean rate -- weight reduction up to 24.2% or almost 58 pounds on average.\nIf confirmed in registrational trials, we believe that magnitude of mean weight reduction would represent a new high watermark for weight loss from a pharmacologic agent at this time point. It's also worth noting that the Phase II retatrutide trial in obesity was well balanced between genders with females representing just under half of all participants in the trial. This was intentional and is atypical for incretin clinical trials in obesity, which often have a higher proportion of female participants, a subgroup that typically experiences greater weight loss than males.\nIndeed, in the retatrutide Phase II obesity trial, the mean change in body weight for female participants at the highest dose was 28.5%. Given these encouraging results, we moved rapidly to initiate the Triumph Phase III program, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight and obesity. These 4 Phase III trials will each run between 68 and 80 weeks. The trajectory of weight loss seen in the Phase II study reinforces our belief that retatrutide can potentially represent a further improvement and additional option for patients seeking pharmacological treatment for obesity and its complications.\nWhile retatrutide's Phase II results in obesity garnered much attention at ADA, the Phase II results in patients with type 2 diabetes are also very encouraging with participants receiving retatrutide achieving a hemoglobin A1c reduction of up to 2% on average in addition to meaningful levels of weight loss. I'm pleased to share that we plan to advance retatrutide into Phase III for type 2 diabetes.\nMoving to tirzepatide on Slide 17. We were delighted to announce in late July that SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 trials of tirzepatide in obesity met all primary and key secondary objectives. In key secondary objectives for both these studies, participants achieved similar mean weight reduction, 26.6% in SURMOUNT-3 and 26.0% in SURMOUNT-4. While these 2 trials were not required for our chronic weight management submission to the FDA, they provide important additional information regarding the role tirzepatide plays in maintaining or adding to the weight loss achieved with either intensive lifestyle intervention or pharmacotherapy in adults living with obesity or overweight.\nSURMOUNT-3 evaluated tirzepatide following an intensive lifestyle modification program and demonstrated that even in people who have a weight loss response to lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide provides significant additional weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 was a randomized withdrawal study in which all participants received tirzepatide for a 36-week lead-in period, at which point, half the participants were switched to placebo and the other half continued treatment with tirzepatide. This study demonstrated that those participants who continued on tirzepatide experienced continued weight loss, while those who switched to placebo started to regain weight.\nThese data reinforce our understanding that obesity is a complex chronic disease for which multiple treatment approaches, including lifestyle modification and effective medications, are needed. We believe tirzepatide is well positioned to be one such treatment option. Accordingly, we submitted an application for tirzepatide for chronic weight management to the FDA during Q2. The FDA granted this application priority review designation, and we anticipate FDA action by year-end.\nSlide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 4, and Slide 19 shows potential key events for the year. I've covered the major updates in diabetes, including the advancement of orforglipron and retatrutide into Phase III since our learning -- last earnings call.\nTurning then to our neuroscience portfolio. 3 weeks ago with the AIC meeting in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we were excited to share the detailed results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, highlighting donanemab's robust efficacy profile across a number of new analyses that reinforce our belief in the medicine's ability to meaningfully slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially in patients earlier in disease progression. We cover the results in some detail during our AIC investor call so I won't cover that again, except to note that we submitted donanemab to the FDA and to the EMA for approval, and we look forward to FDA action before the end of this year.\nShifting to oncology. Launch progress continues with Jaypirca and mantle cell lymphoma, and we are pleased to have the detailed chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the BRUIN Phase I/II trial published in New England Journal in early July. Following the discussion with the FDA, we've now submitted an application for accelerated approval for Jaypirca in CLL patients previously treated with both a covalent BTK inhibitor and venetoclax based on the results from the BRUIN Phase I/II study. We expect FDA action by year-end.\nAlso during the quarter, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for pirtobrutinib for patients with MCL. We continue to study pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase III trials and look forward to the results from the BRUIN 321 trial in CLL, which we now expect to see before the end of this year, and it has been added to our key events slide.\nIn other oncology developments, at ASCO in June, we presented new data from the Verzenio monarchE trial in high-risk early breast cancer. For the first time, we showed data demonstrating the efficacy of the medicine in this setting is not compromised when patients undergo dose reductions. We believe that the ability to manage Verzenio's side effects while preserving efficacy could be very important to ensuring that patients complete their 2 years of therapy. This is an emerging part of Verzenio's differentiation in this class.\nWe're also very excited about last week's announcement regarding the randomized trial of Retevmo in treatment-naive RET fusion-positive lung cancer. As we communicated in the press release, this randomized trial was declared successful on its primary end point of progression-free survival, the first time any targeted therapy in lung cancer has ever shown superiority to a PD-1 plus chemotherapy regimen. While we remain disappointed by the low levels of genomic profiling done at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, we're hopeful that these data will continue to advance the practice of genomic-driven medicine. We look forward to sharing the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting.\nIn our earlier-stage oncology portfolio, the combination experiment of our KRAS G12C inhibitor with pembrolizumab continues to mature nicely. And we're now working to initiate Phase III trials in first-line G12C-mutated lung cancer in the next 6 to 9 months.\nMore broadly, we're excited to see the overall progress of our oncology portfolio. In addition to last week's Retevmo announcement, we expect another 7 randomized trial readouts in 4 to 6 new first-in-human trials across small molecules and biologics in oncology over the next 12 months. With the acquisition of Loxo Oncology 4 years ago, we catalyzed a change in the strategy and direction of oncology at Lilly, and we're seeing the fruits of these efforts.\nFinally, in immunology, we have several updates related to mirikizumab. A Digestive Disease Week in May, we presented new analyses from the Phase III LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 studies, demonstrating that remission of key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including biourgency, was associated with significant improvement in the quality-of-life assessment in adults with UC.\nIn Q2, we launched mirikizumab marketed as Onvia in Japan as a treatment for adults with moderately to severe active UC. In late May, we received approval for Onvio in the EU and have subsequently launched Onvio in Germany and planned additional launches in the EU later this year.\nIn the U.S., we've resubmitted our application to the FDA. We now expect regulatory action by the end of this year. For lebrikizumab, our IL-13 monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for atopic dermatitis, we presented a new secondary analysis at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in May. This post hoc analysis demonstrated improvement or clearance of face or hand dermatitis in adult and adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab. These are parts of the body that are highly visible and for which dermatitis can be particularly burdensome and stigmatizing. We expect regulatory action for lebrikizumab in both the U.S. and EU later this year. Together with Almirall, our development and commercialization partner in Europe, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.\nLooking earlier in our immunology pipeline, we're pleased in May to have the detailed results from our Phase IIa study of parasolimab in rheumatoid arthritis published in the New England Journal. These data were first presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in late 2022 and represent the first clinical evidence that's stimulating endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease.\nAs you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for Lilly R&D with important progress in each of our therapeutic areas.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. This quarter saw an acceleration of revenue growth as our recently launched product portfolio gathers momentum. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies and BAQSIMI revenue, we grew 22% driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.\nThe quarter also saw a continuation of investment in our future growth in our manufacturing expansion, in late-stage medicines in early phase capabilities and in business development. Notwithstanding these long-term investments, we continue to expect our revenue will grow more rapidly than our expense base in the coming years and see significant opportunity for margin expansion.\nWe also achieved meaningful advances in our near-term pipeline with positive phase -- positive top line results, detailed data disclosures and submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA, and completion of the tirzepatide submission in chronic weight management alongside positive top line results from 2 more Phase III trials for the SURMOUNT program. We also shared data from 4 mid-stage clinical trials for orforglipron and retatrutide and initiated Phase III trials for both assets.\nLastly, we announced several targeted business development moves intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio and our R&D capabilities, and we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] We'll end the call at 10:15 a.m. [Operator Instructions]\nPaul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.",

[Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Springnether, Kendo Waha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks, Joe. We're off to a strong start in 2023 with volume-driven revenue growth led by our incretin portfolio, Verzenio and Jardiance. At our Q1 earnings last year, we shared exciting data from SURMOUNT-1, the first of our tirzepatide obesity Phase III trials. Today, we're excited to share the positive top line results for the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III trial for tirzepatide, which examine the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in chronic weight management in a type 2 diabetes population. SURMOUNT-1 set a new bar for weight loss possible from a pharmacologic agent in non-type 2 diabetes population with obesity or overweight in a Phase III trial. And SURMOUNT-2 does the same in the type 2 diabetes population.\nBefore discussing our financial results and pipeline updates, I'd like to also note the actions Lilly announced on March 1 to improve insulin affordability in the United States. We are proud to have led these efforts to make it easier for people to access Lilly insulin, including through the broad implementation of our $35 out-of-pocket cap and a significant reduction in list price for most of our most commonly used insulins. That said, there remains substantial opportunity and need to reduce existing systemic barriers to insulin access and affordability. Bringing affordable insulin to those who need it will require action and engagement by all stakeholders in our health system. But together, we can create real change to improve access and affordability for people who use insulin.\nMoving to our results. You can see this on Slide 4 that the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue, which includes sales of COVID-19 antibodies -- sorry, excluding sales from COVID-19 antibodies grew 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth of 18%. Volume growth in Q1 was underpinned by Mounjaro, which is leading the new product category, which also includes Jaypirca, and we expect it will include additional products in the months and years to come. The new product and growth product classifications represent an evolution from our prior designation of key growth products. We believe that these classifications will help investors see the performance of both our newest products in addition to those with ongoing growth potential.\nIn the first quarter of this year, the new product category contributed $574 million of revenue, and the new product and growth product categories combined to contribute 20 percentage points of volume growth in Q1. These products as well as expecting -- expected upcoming product launches reinforce our belief in the strength of Lilly's growth outlook throughout this decade.\nLast Monday, we broke ground at the site of our 2 new manufacturing facilities in Boone County, Indiana. We also announced a further $1.6 billion investment in addition to the previously announced $2.1 billion investment in this project to expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities. And our progress continues as planned towards production starting later this year at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina.\nOn the business development front, this past week, we entered into agreements to sell the rights of our olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa and the rights to Baqsimi. These 2 transactions will enable us to further focus our time and effort on our next-generation medicines. In our pipeline, we've had several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including label expansion for Verzenio in advanced breast cancer in the U.S.; for mirikizumab approval in Japan and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as the FDA's issuance of a Complete Response Letter in the United States; regulatory submissions in the EU for tirzepatide for chronic weight management and in Japan for lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-2, the second global study evaluating tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight, which will enable completion of our rolling submission with the FDA under Fast Track designation.\nDan will discuss this further, but we are excited with the top line results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-2 trial. As shared late last year, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and initiated a rolling submission for tirzepatide in chronic weight management based on the results of the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And we aligned with the FDA that completion of the submission would come following the SURMOUNT-2 readout. We anticipate completing our submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. We believe addressing obesity could make an enormous difference in millions of people's lives, significantly impact public health and reduce health care costs. We are encouraged by this important next step in the journey to redefine obesity care.\nFinally, this quarter, we distributed $1 billion in dividends and completed $750 million in share repurchases. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we are discussing today.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period.\nGross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets.\nThis quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&D charges.\nOur Q1 effective tax rate was 12.8%. This represents an increase of 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by the tax impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $1.62.\nOn Slide 7, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 14%. As a reminder, COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q1 of 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion compared to 0 in Q1 of this year. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 19%, driven by robust volume growth for Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. We experienced a net price decline of 5% in the U.S. for the quarter, driven primarily by Humalog and Trulicity.\nAs we move into the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. pricing headwind versus prior year will ease considerably driven by Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics. Europe continued its steady growth trajectory with revenue in Q1 growing 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 13% in Q1. For Japan, Q1 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as the base period impact of generic competition to Cymbalta and Alimta waned, and we continue to see strong robust growth in our newer medicines led by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, Jardiance.\nMoving to China. Revenue declined 1% in constant currency with volume growth of 19% offset by net price declines. Volume growth was driven by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, increase in shipments of Olumiant. Price declines were largely driven by Humalog, which was added to the volume-based procurement scheme in Q2 of last year. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 9% in constant currency, driven by the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia for $95 million in Q1 of 2022, partially offset by growth in Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance.\nSlide 8 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As Dave mentioned earlier, we have evolved a prior product categorization from key growth products, which included 10 key products launched since 2014 to now focus on 2 categories, the first called new product and the second called growth product. The new product categories led by Mounjaro and also includes Jaypirca, and we expect to expand to include new products in the coming months and years. The growth product category is made up of select products that have been in the market for several years with continued exclusivity.\nAs you can see, the new and growth product categories contributed over 20 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter, which was largely offset by the previously mentioned decline in COVID-19 antibody revenue. While the lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibody will be a headwind to growth throughout the year, the most substantial impact was in Q1. As I mentioned earlier, in Q1 2022, we realized approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, representing 75% of the $2 billion sold in the full year 2022.\nSlide 9 provides additional perspective on the trends and specific highlights across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 60% in Q1 as the long-term monarchE follow-up data shared at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December and the recently expanded label support continued uptake in adjuvant breast cancer. Verzenio is now the standard of care in its Category 1 NCCN listed for high-risk adjuvant breast cancer.\nJardiance also continued its outstanding performance with worldwide sales growth of 38% for the quarter. In Q1, we were pleased to announce that based on the results of the Phase III DINAMO trial, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance for children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. And lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of Trulicity's performance in a growing and dynamic incretin market. Worldwide sales of Trulicity grew 14% in Q1, anchored by the product's robust efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the convenient and easy-to-use device. Looking more holistically at Trulicity and Mounjaro together, U.S. revenue for these 2 products grew 59% in Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022.\nMoving to Slide 10. Let me share some commentary and context on Mounjaro's performance for the quarter. We are pleased with the positive momentum over the course of Q1 as it means more patients with type 2 diabetes are realizing the substantial benefits of treatment with Mounjaro. While the trajectory of prescription growth shifted following our actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients, we have continued to see a positive overall trend. Our focus is on driving new-to-brand growth while continuing to expand access.\nIn Q1, we initiated our first Mounjaro direct-to-consumer TV campaign, and we continue to steadily build access from Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, access stood at just under 60% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts for Mounjaro in Q1 was just over 55%, up from approximately 40% in Q4 2022.\nAs a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescription outside the $25 non-covered co-pay cards but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of the year, we expect continued improvement in access in the proportion of paid scripts and in new-to-brand prescription.\nOn Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2023, we invested $2.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned just over $1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $700 million in stock.\nSlide 12 represents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the revenue guidance range by $900 million to now be in the range of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Since announcing our 2023 financial guidance in December, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies. We have updated our full year revenue outlook based on recent spot rates. This FX update is driving approximately $650 million of the $900 million increase in our revenue guidance. The remainder of the increase is attributable to underlying business performance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we are increasing the range of marketing, selling and administrative costs by $100 million to reflect our updated exchange rate assumptions. This results in an updated range of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. We are also increasing the range for research and development expenses by $100 million, driven by updated exchange rate assumptions and investments in our late-stage portfolio. This results in an updated R&D range of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion.\nWe have incorporated IP R&D charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of earnings, which totaled $105 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have not included any IP R&D charges associated with potential or pending business development transactions. Additionally, the recently announced agreements to sell the right of our olanzapine portfolio and of Baqsimi have now been included in guidance. Each transactions will be factored into our financial guidance after it closes. Other income and expenses and tax rate guidance remain unchanged.\nBased on these changes, we are raising our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $8.18 to $8.38 per share and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.85.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Scientific Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive results for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III study. Tirzepatide met the co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary endpoints. Participants with obesity or overweight and with type 2 diabetes achieved up to 16% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 34 pounds.\nAdditionally, 86% of people taking 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved at least 5% body rate reduction. This was in line with our expectations based on our SURPASS-3 data in a similar population. With this SURMOUNT-2 data, we now have 2 positive Phase III trials for tirzepatide in obesity, 1 in patients without type 2 diabetes and 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes. We now look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA in the coming weeks.\nI'll cover the SURMOUNT-2 results in more detail, but first, let me spend a few minutes providing an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 8 studies.\nOn Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for the core SURMOUNT-1 to 4 studies as well as the more recently announced SURMOUNT-MMO and SURMOUNT-5 studies. Five of the 6 studies compare efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity, while the most recently posted trial, SURMOUNT-5 compares tirzepatide to 2.4-milligram semaglutide.\nAs a reminder, SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. And it delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2, which we're reporting today, evaluated treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program and SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss.\nSURMOUNT-5 is an open-label trial that will enroll 700 adults who have obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities without type 2 diabetes and will compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide 2.4-milligrams. Finally, SURMOUNT-MMO is our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity. We expect the next 2 studies, SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 to read out later this year, while SURMOUNT-5 is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2025. SURMOUNT-MMO, as an outcome study, will take several more years to complete.\nOn Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-2 study where tirzepatide 15-milligram delivered 15.7% mean body weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight. With a baseline weight across the study of 222 pounds, tirzepatide treatment led to a mean body weight reduction of 34 pounds on the 15-milligram arm of the study. We're also very pleased to see how well the 10-milligram tirzepatide performed with a 13.4% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimand. Results for the treatment regimen estimand were similar to the efficacy estimand and are detailed in this morning's SURMOUNT-2 press release.\nMoving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide achieved the second co-primary endpoint of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2 showed up to 86.4% of patients achieved this level of weight reduction at 72 weeks, again, using the efficacy estimand. This is compared to 30.6% of patients on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Furthermore, over half of all participants in the 15-milligram treatment arm achieved at least 15% weight loss. It has been previously observed in incretin obesity trials that weight loss in a type 2 diabetes population is less than weight loss seen in a non-type 2 diabetes population, a finding consistent with the results we've now reported from the SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2 trials. The average weight reductions reported in the SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes range from 7% to 8% less than those seen in SURMOUNT-1, which was an exclusively non-type 2 diabetes population.\nThere are a number of potential mechanisms that may explain this effect, including the weight gain-promoting effects of some classes of anti-hyperglycemic medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide treatment, gender differences between 2 populations and diminished caloric loss effects of glucosuria. These differences manifested as we expected, and the SURMOUNT-2 top line results represent the most robust weight loss seen in a Phase III pharmacological clinical trial consisting entirely of type 2 diabetes patients with obesity or overweight, and we are highly pleased with these results.\nMoving to Slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in the study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for treatment of obesity. As in SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS program, the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related, were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred through dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 3.8% and 7.4% for the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms, respectively, compared to 3.8% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.3% and 13.8% in the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 14.9% for placebo.\nWe look forward to sharing more data from SURMOUNT-2 at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and to submitting the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Obesity is a widespread and chronic disease in need of more effective treatment options. The FDA Fast Track designation that tirzepatide received for obesity reflects the seriousness of the condition and the substantial unmet medical need. With impressive trial results now in hand for SURMOUNT-2 and SURMOUNT-1 studies, we look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in the coming weeks.\nWith respect to regulatory action in Europe, as Dave mentioned, we have already completed our submission to the EMA for chronic weight management indication. The EMA submission was initiated based on the results from the SURPASS trial program in type 2 diabetes and the SURMOUNT-1 Phase III trial in obesity. We expect to have a European Commission decision in the first half of 2024. In addition to all the work on tirzepatide for obesity, we also disclosed earlier this month on clinicaltrials.gov the initiation of a bioequivalent study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide administered using the existing auto-injector device and a new test device. We expect to work on tirzepatide and other injectable incretins for a long time. And we intend to explore different presentations for these medicines to meet our goal of bringing the benefits to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible.\nMoving on from tirzepatide to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24, and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. Continuing within diabetes and metabolic disease.\nEarlier this month, we began recruiting for the first Phase III clinical trial for orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist. This ACHIEVE-4 trial is an open-label study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased risk for cardiovascular events.\nThis is the first in what will be a broader series of studies for orforglipron. It is the largest and longest trial in the program, which is why we chose to initiate this trial first. Enrollment is now underway and we expect patient dosing to recur shortly, after which orforglipron will be placed with our Phase III assets on the summary slide. You'll also see we have advanced our Relaxin long-acting molecule to Phase II development for treatment of heart failure.\nShifting to immunology. It was a quarter of mixed progress for mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 inhibitor. We were pleased with the approval in late March in Japan for mirikizumab under the brand name Omvoh for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. A few days later, we were similarly pleased with the positive CHMP opinion from the EMA. However, regarding mirikizumab's regulatory path in the United States, we announced earlier this month that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. The letter did not cite any concerns regarding the safety or efficacy profile of mirikizumab but focused exclusively on certain aspects related to the proposed commercial manufacturing of mirikizumab.\nWe remain confident mirikizumab's Phase III data and its potential to help people with ulcerative colitis. We look forward to working with the FDA to address the manufacturing questions in order to achieve our goal of bringing mirikizumab to patients in the U.S.\nAlso in our late phase immunology portfolio, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for lebrikizumab for patients with atopic dermatitis. Moving earlier in our immunology pipeline, during last month's American Academy of Dermatology meeting, we shared data from the single-dose Phase II trial for eltrecabart, our CXCR1/2 antibody in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. The data showed good tolerability and clear separation between eltrecabart and placebo, along with a reduction in abscesses and nodules, reflecting reduced disease activity.\nLastly, in immunology, we've removed respegaldesleukin from our pipeline. In February, following the top line data announcement from the Phase II study in systemic lupus erythematosus, we informed our partner, Nektar Therapeutics that we do not intend to advance the asset into Phase III development.\nMoving on to neuroscience. Last month, we announced that our last active solanezumab trial, the antiamyloid in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease study or A4 study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The A4 study was conducted through an innovative public-private partnership, and we were thankful for the time and effort of the clinical study staff, participants and study partners. This study formally concludes our clinical development of solanezumab. The A4 results, while disappointing, were not a surprise, given the advancements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease since the study initiated almost 10 years ago.\nSolanezumab only targets soluble amyloid beta and does not clear plaque. Donanemab and remternetug, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to bind to and clear amyloid plaque, and we now understand that substantial plaque clearance is required in order for anti-amyloid drugs to show clinical efficacy. Accordingly, we were pleased to share new data for donanemab and remternetug during the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in late March. For donanemab, we shared data from our TRAILBLAZER-EXT, a Phase II long-term follow-on study of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ.\nWhile study limitations include a relatively small number of patients, the data showed encouraging trends and the longer-term effects on amyloid and tau levels and clinical progression. We also disclosed the trial design and objective for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, a Phase IIIb study to expand the science and understanding of ARIA in relationship to amyloid lowering through imaging and blood-based biomarkers in different dosing paradigms. This study will leverage enhanced MRI sequences as well as blood-based biomarkers and other patient characteristics that may predict ARIA. And we'll investigate the effect of different dosing regimens on the frequency and severity of ARIA.\nOf course, we expect the next key milestone for donanemab will be later this quarter when we obtain the results for our confirmatory Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial. We look forward to sharing these results and to advancing the regulatory process for donanemab assuming positive data from this trial. This quarter, we also shared the first clinical data from remternetug from a Phase I multiple ascending dose study, which highlighted the potential speed and depth of amyloid plaque lowering in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data on amyloid clearance, safety and tolerability supported our decision to move this asset into Phase III, and we look forward to sharing further updates as the program progresses.\nYou'll also notice we have a number of developments in our early-stage neuroscience portfolio with a Phase II entry for our GBA1 Gene Therapy asset in the Gaucher disease type 1 indication along with 2 Phase I pain asset entries and 1 Phase II pain asset discontinuation.\nShifting now to oncology. Just yesterday, Jaypirca received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Verzenio for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High-risk patients can now be more easily identified with the removal of the Ki-67 score requirement for patient selection.\nMoving earlier in our oncology pipeline. We presented data from our Phase I study of our KRASG12C inhibitor as part of the AACR meeting last week. These data show promising efficacy and the potential for a differentiated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab. We're working on finalizing dose selection for our drug in combination with pembrolizumab. And at AACR, we also showed data from CYCLONE 1, a single-arm unblinded study, which was the first to investigate Verzenio in prostate cancer. This early study informed the design of our CYCLONE 2 adaptive Phase II/III trial, which last year cleared our preset threshold to advance to Phase III and for which we expect to read out as soon as late this year. Q1 was another busy and productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Eli Lilly & Co.\n\nThank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress to start the year. Our core business, which excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, grew 10%, driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. This growth was achieved despite headwinds related to pricing, to generic erosion of Alimta in the U.S. and a moderated but still negative foreign exchange impacts.\nIn the coming quarters, we expect the impact of COVID-19 antibody revenue in the prior periods will ebb, while our new product and growth product categories of medicines will drive continued revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. While the quarter was not without some challenges, which I am confident we'll overcome, we made meaningful advances in our pipeline, including the approval of an expanded label of Verzenio, the first approval of mirikizumab in Japan, submission of tirzepatide for obesity in the EU and positive results from our second Phase III trial for tirzepatide in obesity.\nWe also demonstrated leadership to improve insulin access and affordability for millions of Americans. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to both executing on the significant opportunities before us and to continuing the important and often difficult work to discover, develop and bring to market innovative medicines to address some of the greatest areas of unmet medical need.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] We're going to end the call at 11:15 a.m. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.",

(Operator Instructions)\nAnd as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Lois. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo@Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke from the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay. Thanks, Joe. 2022 was a year of strong pipeline and commercial performance for Lilly. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the U.S. and significant FX headwinds, and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline.\nIn our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for 2 assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway: pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma; and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets.\nOn January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients, and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval.\nWe have consistently stated that we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease.\nUnfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time.\nAlso in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, whose novel, reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor.\nWe are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca, and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of 2 of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches, along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation, underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time.\nOn Slide 4, you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter.\nFor pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase III readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea.\nWe also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead. On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability, and we entered into a strategic research collaborations, with a focus on new modalities and technologies.\nFinally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4, we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend, and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year.\nMoving to Slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13.\nOne item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable, high-quality insulin to at least 1 million people living with diabetes in low- to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa. This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost, high-quality medicines, sorry. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term.\nWith this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate, fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges. We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality health care for 30 million people living in limited resource settings annually by 2030.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slides 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.\nAs Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year, declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022.\nBebtelovimab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any U.S. region, and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023. Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 415 basis points dampening of revenue growth in Q4.\nKey growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.\nTotal operating expenses declined 1% in Q4. Lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\nOperating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021 driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8%, an increase from 26.8% in 2021.\nOur Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared. In addition, this provision did increase our tax payment in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion. At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 10%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance. Net price was flat in the U.S. this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the U.S. was in line with our expectation.\nMoving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 increased 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance, Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe.\nIn Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters, by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity, including Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect a return to growth this year as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro.\nIn China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption.\nRevenue in the rest of the world increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sale of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan.\nAs shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume was substantial in Q4 2022 and largely offset volume growth from key products. While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first 3 quarters of 2023, our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products, including Mounjaro.\nSlide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency, generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue.\nWhile Lilly's incretin portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth, both in percentage and absolute terms for other key products, including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the adjuvant indication. Jardiance sales grew 42%, and the product retains the leadership position in a competitive market globally. Demand for our incretin portfolio remains strong, both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the U.S., and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches.\nIn terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretin products, there have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies in receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the U.S. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to its website details regarding affected doses and expected timing. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have announced plans to add additional substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts is our RTP site in North Carolina, where progress continues as planned, and we look forward to the start of production later this year.\nMoving to Slide 11, Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile and positive customer experiences. For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class, and further 10% of switches from Trulicity.\nAs we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes but were not expected to impact net revenue. As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions, with some week-by-week volatility driven by end-of-year seasonality. We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1st, access stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D.\nRegarding the percentage of paid scripts, for Q4, we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40%, with paid script defined as dose prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay cards. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment. In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life-changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity, in our future innovation through R&D and business development, and we return capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nSlide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range. During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022, and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%. This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis.\nRegarding FX rates, there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only 1 month into the year, and FX markets can be quite volatile.\nAs I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023, given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022. To a lesser extent, the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the U.S. in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business, excluding COVID-19 antibodies.\nThis year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior VP, Chief Scientific & Medical Officer and President of Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. 2022 was a really productive year for Lilly R&D as we advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions, and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022. As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib, now known as Jaypirca. By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch 2 new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for donanemab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive, will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval.\nIn 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer; our weekly insulin for diabetes; remternetug in Alzheimer's disease; and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have orforglipron and retatrutide in diabetes and obesity.\nGiven the updates we provided in mid-December, today, I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023.\nStarting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease. In November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. As the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to date, the results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease.\nThe overall safety data were consistent with previous findings, confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA an EMA for approval, and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months.\nIn January, we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed-dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to insulin glargine in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes patients. With this initiation, all 5 studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway.\nMoving to earlier-stage assets in our diabetes and CD pipeline. In Q4, we advanced 2 assets into Phase II that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apoA protein and the lipoprotein particle; and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apoA in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D investor meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022. We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting apoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I.\nOur genetic medicines portfolio is advancing, and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules. Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor.\nIn oncology, we're of course pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca, and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo@Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program, which recently dosed its first patient.\nAlso, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting as a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received 2 to 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence.\nLastly, turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call, at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the U.S. FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated cohort 1 Ki-67 greater than 20% population.\nIn immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody, peresolimab, in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November, and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study.\nMoving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021.\nWith regards to donanemab, as Dave mentioned, the solid efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was the number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance.\nDue to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as 6 months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential of donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study in Q2 of this year.\nIn summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2022. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type 2 diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management. In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process, assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people.\nFinally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases; and for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023.\nWith continued growth of Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year, and know strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030, and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world.\nSo now I'll turn it over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. (Operator Instructions) We'll end the call at 11:15. Lois, please go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.",

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Lois, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo@Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nWell, thanks, Joe. Over the last 3 months, we continued to successfully execute our strategy. On the commercial front, we drove strong volume-based growth of our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro, which has seen an impressive initial uptick. At the same time, we advanced our late-phase pipeline, progressing towards potential launches of 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also investing in our early-stage pipeline and new modalities like gene therapy. To meet the growing demand for our products and prepare for future launches, we have also continued to invest in expansion of our manufacturing footprint.\nI'd highlight 2 areas of high unmet need where Lilly is progressing new medicines to improve patient outcomes: obesity and Alzheimer's disease. In obesity, we are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, enabling us to potentially bring this promising medicine to patients even sooner. We're also initiating SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity.\nIn Alzheimer's disease, our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study for donanemab continues to progress towards a top line readout in mid-2023. And we continue to work with the FDA to pursue an accelerated approval based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data. We also announced completion of our submission for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis in both the U.S. and the EU. With already completed submissions for donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab, we are excited by the potential to launch 4 new medicines between now and the end of 2023. We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of new product launches for Lilly and undoubtedly one of the most impressive rates in our industry.\nTurning to our strategic deliverables on Slide 4. Q3 revenue grew 7% in constant currency. Worldwide volume grew a robust 14%. Key product growth grew 19% and now account for 70% of our core business revenue, a reflection of the youth and durability of our marketed product portfolio. We're encouraged to see the continued global adoption of products like Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and our [anchor 10] medicines, including Mounjaro and Trulicity.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3, which is in line with the same period last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges.\nFor pipeline milestones, we shared several important updates since our Q2 earnings call, including FDA Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, with completion of a rolling submission expected by mid-2023; EU and Japan approval for Mounjaro for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; U.S. and EU submission of lebrikizumab for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and FDA accelerated approval for Retevmo in RET fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors regardless of tumor type and traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.\nDan will discuss this in more detail later, but we are excited to have announced the acquisition of Akouos, which aims to accelerate efforts in gene therapies that promise to restore, improve and preserve hearing for patients living with disabling hearing loss. This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to advancing genetic medicine at Lilly. And finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders.\nOn Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including several important personnel, COVID-19 antibody and ESG updates. We announced the upcoming retirement of Steve Fry, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Diversity, following more than 35 years at our company. I'd like to thank Steve for playing a key role in advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and leading our efforts to be the premier employer in our region and our sector.\nWe also welcome Eric Dozier, who will succeed Steve. Eric has nearly 25 years of experience at Lilly and a strong track record of developing people and teams that deliver impressive business results. I'm confident he is the right leader to progress our people strategy, which is vital for Lilly to achieve our ambitious growth objectives ahead.\nIn August, we began to make our COVID-19 antibody, bebtelovimab, available for purchase to states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor. In Q3, we shipped an additional 600,000 -- or 60,000, I should say, doses of bebtelovimab to the U.S. government for approximately $110 million. These are to be used for the financially vulnerable patients through a product replacement program. At this time, we are not anticipating any further U.S. government orders for bebtelovimab.\nWith regards to our ESG efforts, we published our inaugural Sustainability Bond Allocation and Impact Report, highlighting the allocation of approximately EUR 128 million across a range of sustainability projects since the issuance of the sustainability bond in September of '21. For more information about this and the many other aspects of our ESG program, you can visit our Lilly ESG website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Anat for a more detailed review of our Q3 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q3, let me highlight a change in how we expect to communicate our acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. In mid-October, we filed an 8-K with the SEC to provide investors earlier clarity on the impact from acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for Q3. In future quarters, we generally expect to provide this information through quarterly updates on our Investor Relations website.\nNow moving to our results. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2022, and I'll focus my overall comments on non-GAAP performance. A few notable items affected year-over-year comparisons in Q3. Foreign exchange rates had a roughly 430 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as Q3 revenue grew by 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We recognized $86 million of revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan. We experienced the first full quarter impact of Alimta's U.S. patent expiry, and the increase in sales of COVID-19 antibodies and the decrease in sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 impacted our results.\nWhen excluding revenue from Alimta, which is now off patent across the EU, Japan and the U.S., COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew 9% for the quarter or 14% in constant currency, highlighting solid momentum for our core business.\nGross margin was roughly flat year-over-year. The impact of lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs were offset by favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\nTotal operating expenses increased 1% this quarter. Growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses were largely offset by lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges that reduced operating expense growth by nearly 350 basis points. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by the increased costs associated with the launch of Mounjaro, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 6%, driven by higher development expense for late-stage assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.\nOperating income increased 6% in Q3, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributable to the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges.\nOur Q3 effective tax rate was 10.7%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the favorable tax impact related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act.\nAt the bottom line, earnings per share increased approximately 12% this quarter to $1.98 per share. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charge had a negative impact of $0.06 in Q3 2022 compared to $0.17 in the same period last year.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange movements primarily related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar decreased revenue by 4%.\nMoving to our performance by key geography. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% driven by volume growth of 15%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue in the U.S. increased 20% driven primarily by key growth products. U.S. volume growth was partially offset by a net price decline of 4% driven primarily by lower realized prices for Humalog due to segment mix and the list price reduction for Insulin Lispro injection.\nMoving to Europe. Revenue grew 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio and Taltz. We are encouraged by the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth as the impact from the patent expiry for Alimta, which lost exclusivity in June 2021, recede from base period comparison.\nFor Japan, Q3 revenue decreased by 2% in constant currency. The growth of our newer medicine and revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan was more than offset by the continued impact of declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both faced generic entry in June 2021. We expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023 as we continue to scale our key growth products and the impact of patent expiration subsides.\nIn China, revenue declined 10% in constant currency as we continue to be impacted by the Zero-COVID policy measures. We're also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures for Tyvyt from local competitors with NRDL access. In addition, we experienced the first full quarter of the pricing impact of volume-based procurement for Humalog. As we expect to maintain a high level of access for our innovative portfolio, we believe our volume should accelerate to drive net growth in the future.\nRevenue in the rest of the world decreased 6% in constant currency in Q3 primarily driven by customer buying patterns. The year-to-date growth of 8% in constant currency in this region is more representative of underlying trends.\nAs shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove approximately 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our current performance and future outlook.\nSlide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 19% or 25% in constant currency, generated $4.6 billion in sales and made up 70% of our core business revenue. Products like Verzenio, Taltz in dermatology and Jardiance have outpaced competitors growth and are leaders in new-to-brand share of market within their respective classes.\nIn the injectable incretin market, we continue to see significant opportunity for further class growth. In addition to Mounjaro's successful launch in the U.S., Trulicity has continued to experience strong growth globally. To date, our incretin manufacturing production is ahead of our internal plan, and we remain focused on sustaining this performance.\nStrong demand for Trulicity, partially due to ongoing limited availability of competitor GLP-1, continues to challenge our ability to meet expanding demand in most international markets. In those situations, we're working hard to supply market demand while minimizing impact to existing patients, including communication in these markets not to initiate new patients on Trulicity. In the U.S., script volume remains robust. And while we build more capacity, wholesalers may experience intermittent restocking delays of Trulicity orders.\nMoving to Slide 11. We're pleased with the rapid uptake of Mounjaro in the first 4 months since launch. Approximately 70% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients naive to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class and less than 10% for switches from Trulicity. We are progressing peer negotiations and have more than doubled the level of access to approximately 45% of total commercial and Part D lives. And as we expand access, the proportion of paid scripts should start to increase.\nOur focus is to make Mounjaro available for type 2 diabetes patients, and we intend to take actions designed to ensure access and supply for these patients. These actions may negatively impact prescription volume but are not expected to impact net revenue.\nWe have seen unprecedented demand for Mounjaro's type 2 diabetes launch in the U.S., bolstered by strong efficacy and a positive customer experience. Availability of competitor's incretin also is a key factor as we assess Mounjaro's demand and supply.\nTo meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have plans to add substantial additional manufacturing capacity. In 2023, we expect the RTP site in North Carolina to become fully operational and that capacity, coupled with additional actions and extensions in other sites, will result in doubling Lilly's incretin manufacturing capacity at the end of 2023.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $6.8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in dividend and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities are to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, bolster manufacturing capacity, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.\nSlide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook now includes an additional $300 million of headwinds from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $1 billion of foreign exchange headwinds on revenue for the full year compared to our original guidance. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged.\nOur guidance now includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $670 million, reflecting total charges in the first 9 months of the year. We have not recognized material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges to date in Q4. And this guidance does not include any impact from the potential acquisition -- for potential business development or acquisition in the remainder of the year, including pending acquisition of Akouos. Our non-GAAP operating margins remain unchanged at approximately 29%.\nOn a reported basis, operating margin is now expected to be approximately 26% driven by the intangible asset impairment for our GBA1 Gene Therapy due to changes in estimated launch timing. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $600 million to $700 million, reflecting the net impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during Q3 2022.\nOur tax rate and EPS in the first 9 months of the year includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year continues to assume this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for the full year 2022.\nAssuming this deferral or repeal occurs before the end of the year, we expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which includes the cumulative tax impact of immediately expensing research and development costs for the full year 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%.\nBased on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.46 to now be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65 per share and lowered our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.85. The $0.20 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates as well as the $0.06 impact from the incremental acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in Q3.\nNow before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as you begin to think about next year. Starting with revenue, we're confident in the growth outlook of our core business. We expect to build on the positive momentum across our key growth products, including the continued strong launch of Mounjaro and launches of new products. While we anticipate that initial revenue from our next wave of potential launches will be modest in 2023 with only partial revenue, we do expect that donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab will serve as additional catalysts for continued growth.\nIn 2023, we will see the full year impact of Alimta's patent expiry in the U.S., where new generics have eroded Alimta sales starting mid-Q2 and we anticipate a low single-digit headwind from foreign exchange rates. As for revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, we will continue to make bebtelovimab available for purchase. However, the demand for these therapies will depend not only on COVID-19 case counts but also on evolving variants and available therapies. We continue to believe that COVID-19 antibodies will not be a major driver for long-term growth for Lilly.\nWe will invest in our future as we advance promising R&D opportunities, expand our manufacturing capacity and support the potential launch of multiple new products. Assuming inflation persists, we expect to see that impact in 2023 as well.\nAlso, we will be making a significant investment in one of our most important assets, our talented workforce, through increases in compensation that are partially due to inflation pressures, but also to ensure that we have the right capabilities to deliver on the promise of our future growth.\nWhile these investments will slow our operating margin expansion in 2023, they are critical to maximizing pipeline and new launch opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid- to long term. We look forward to sharing more details on our 2023 guidance call on December 13.\nNow I'll turn over the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior VP, Chief Scientific & Medical Officer and President of Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. 2022 has been another outstanding year for R&D at Lilly. In addition to Mounjaro's approval, we have now completed regulatory submissions for 4 new medicines that could all launch by the end of 2023: pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab, lebrikizumab and donanemab. In addition, we advanced our early-stage pipeline with promising next-generation assets in all of our key areas. Plus we've continued to improve our capabilities and advance our projects in our growing nucleic acid medicine portfolio.\nBefore I share an R&D update for our core business, let me briefly add to Anat's update on COVID-19 antibodies. While we've made bebtelovimab commercially available, we're also closely watching the emergence of new highly mutated strains. Based on pseudovirus data, we do not believe that bebtelovimab will neutralize against the new BQ variants. However, we do have potentially broadly neutralizing antibodies in our labs that we can consider bringing forward if there is a need and an aligned path forward with health authorities.\nMoving to our core R&D portfolio. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover important developments since our last earnings call by therapeutic area.\nStarting with diabetes and obesity. We have several updates for tirzepatide. For type 2 diabetes, in addition to the U.S. approval of Mounjaro in Q2, we're pleased to announce recent approvals in the EU and Japan. For chronic weight management, we're pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions that have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.\nWe plan to initiate a rolling submission this year that will be primarily based on the results from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which is complete; and SURMOUNT-2, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2023. Assuming positive SURMOUNT-2 results, we expect to complete the rolling submission with these data in mid-2023 for potential regulatory action as early as late next year. We're working hard to bring tirzepatide to adults living with obesity as soon as we can.\nWe also presented the trial design of tirzepatide's SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study. SURMOUNT-MMO evaluates treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults living with obesity without diabetes and measures the effects of tirzepatide on a broad set of outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular events. As our primary endpoint, we are measuring the occurrence of a cardiovascular event from a 5-point CV composite that includes all-cause mortality. We've also incorporated key secondary endpoints, including traditional MACE 3 events, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and adverse renal outcomes.\nIn SURMOUNT-MMO, we are studying both primary and secondary prevention of events in a broader at-risk population more representative of that seen in clinical practice. The SURMOUNT-MMO study has now initiated, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future. SURMOUNT-MMO is just the latest addition to tirzepatide's development plan where our goal is to not only demonstrate chronic weight management but also to demonstrate improvement across multiple outcomes as a result of weight loss. We're extremely confident in tirzepatide's potential to impact health outcomes of patients living with type 2 diabetes, obesity and other obesity-related metabolic outcomes.\nTransitioning to the rest of our diabetes portfolio. We started 2 more Phase III studies for our weekly basal insulin Fc and expect to start the fifth and final registration study in the QWINT program in the coming months. We also received FDA approval for the Tempo Smart Button, a medical device and key component of Lilly's forthcoming Tempo personalized diabetes management platform. We're excited to begin to introduce this platform to the marketplace this year.\nMoving to oncology. In line with expectations previously communicated, we've now performed another interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high risk early breast cancer study of Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The results of this analysis will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium next month.\nWe're excited by what we've seen, and we look forward to sharing the data publicly. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in the adjuvant setting, and we are enthusiastic about Verzenio's ability to substantially reduce the risk of developing incurable, life-threatening metastatic disease.\nWe also announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Retevmo for pretreated adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion regardless of tumor type. And also granted traditional approval for Retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a RET gene fusion as detected by an FDA-approved test. We're grateful to have the opportunity to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to more patients across more tumor types with Retevmo.\nWe also began dosing patients in our fifth Phase III study for pirtobrutinib. This latest trial is a head-to-head study evaluating pirtobrutinib against ibrutinib in BTK inhibitor-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As a reminder, pirtobrutinib is currently under priority review at the FDA for mantle cell lymphoma previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with regulatory action expected in early 2023. We also continue to have discussions with the FDA about potentially accelerating the approval pathway for CLL in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.\nSwitching to immunology. We presented detailed week 52 results from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis at 2 recent dermatology conferences. The maintenance data showed that lebrikizumab provided robust and durable skin clearance with improvements in itch, sleep and quality of life amongst patients who achieved a clinical response in the 16-week induction period.\nNotably, the results also suggested that less frequent dosing of lebrikizumab can provide similar improvements to once every 2-week dosing. Based upon the data we've collected across our trials in over 2,000 patients, we believe lebrikizumab could become a first-line biologic for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a disease where there's significant need to provide new options for a large and diverse patient population.\nAs part of our efforts to reach a diverse patient population, we've recently initiated an innovative clinical trial to evaluate lebrikizumab for people with skin of color who have a disproportionately higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and often struggle with more severe forms of the disease. We have now submitted a BLA to the FDA. And Almirall, who holds rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for dermatologic indications in Europe, has submitted to the EMA for authorization. We expect regulatory decisions in both the U.S. and the EU by the end of next year. Together with Almirall, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.\nShifting to our efforts in genetic medicines. You'll see that we have now advanced our ANGPTL3 siRNA to Phase II development in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is our first siRNA asset to advance to Phase II. And with this molecule, alongside our Lp(a) siRNA, where we shared proof-of-concept data last year, we're optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes using our portfolio of genetic medicines.\nWithin gene therapy, we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with fatal neurodegenerative diseases, where we're advancing our Prevail Therapeutics programs. We particularly look forward to sharing biomarker results from our progranulin gene therapy program at an upcoming scientific meeting for frontotemporal dementia.\nBuilding on our gene therapy experience with Prevail, we're thrilled to welcome Akouos and their talented team who will bring a transformational gene therapy approach to treating genetically defined hearing loss. Hearing loss is an area of severe unmet need that historically has not been a focus of pharmacologic development. And we believe treatment of sensorineural hearing loss through gene therapy delivered to the inner ear is an area ripe for technologic advances for the benefit of patients.\nFinally, let me turn to Alzheimer's disease, where there have been a number of important developments since our last call. As a company dedicated to the fight against Alzheimer's, we were pleased to see the positive top line Phase III results for lecanemab. Following donanemab's TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, this lecanemab study may further support the benefit of removing amyloid plaques for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.\nThese data certainly reinforce our confidence in donanemab and the forthcoming readout from our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, which is expected by the middle of 2023, and which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. In the meantime, we continue working with the FDA to seek accelerated approval in early '23 based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data.\nThe availability of and access to safe and effective therapies is important to slow the devastating impact on the estimated 6.5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide living with this disease and their loved ones. While we acknowledge the hard work ahead to bring these therapies to patients in need, we are excited and we are confident in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio and the potential impact our drugs can have on patients.\nAccordingly, we initiated TRAILRUNNER-ALZ 1, the first trial in our Phase III program for remternetug, our next-generation anti-amyloid antibody. Remternetug has demonstrated deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance and provides the opportunity to explore flexible dosing regimens for patients.\nFinally, in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head trial comparing donanemab to aducanumab on amyloid plaque lowering in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have now achieved positive results on the co-primary endpoints of amyloid lowering as expected with a consistent safety profile to previous donanemab studies. For this study, the incidence of ARIA-E in the donanemab group was 21.1%, with 2.8% of donanemab-treated patients showing symptomatic ARIA-E, suggesting the potential that rates of plaque clearance are not directly linked to rates of ARIA development. We'll share the detailed results at the upcoming CTAD meeting in late November, including the relationship between the degree of amyloid plaque removal and plasma phospho-tau as well as radiographic ARIA.\nWhile we focus most of our markets today on late-stage assets, you'll also notice we have a number of developments across our early-stage portfolio as shown on the slides. Across the pipeline, Q3 was another productive quarter at Lilly.\nNow I turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We continue to grow our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro's strong U.S. launch. At the same time, we continue to advance our pipeline, progressing towards potential launches for 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also internally and externally investing in our early-stage pipeline and discovery capabilities. With the progress we've made, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nJoe Fletcher\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. (Operator Instructions) Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.",

Welcome to the Lilly Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2022 Earnings Call. Apologies for the hour delay. We had some technical issues on the AT&T side. So thanks for your patience.\nI'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team; as well as Joe Fletcher, who will be taking over leadership of the IR team this month.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks a lot, Kevin. In Q2, we achieved a number of impactful pipeline milestones, including approval and launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., the FDA submission and acceptance of donanemab as well as pirtobrutinib and positive top line results for lebrikizumab and EU and Japan submissions for mirikizumab. This pipeline progress underscores the breadth and depth of our exciting long-term outlook.\nPerhaps the headline story for Lilly this second quarter was the launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., where initial uptake has been strong. We're hearing a great deal of enthusiasm from the field, and we're excited about the potential for this new medicine to provide A1C and weight loss benefits to adults living with type 2 diabetes. We remain focused on gaining broad open access for Mounjaro and expect the full impact of this medicine for patients and our business to be realized over time as that access is achieved.\nTurning to Q2 financial results and progress on our strategic deliverables, we saw relatively flat top line performance in constant currency as strong volume-driven growth for key products, like Verzenio, Jardiance and Trulicity, was offset by lower prices as well as for Alimta's patent expiry in key markets around the world and last year's sale of Cialis rights in China.\nVolume for this quarter grew a robust 10%. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sale of Cialis rights in China and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% compared to Q2 2021.\nIn Q2, our newer medicines contributed 18% to volume growth and now account for 67% of our core business revenue, which we believe, together with our robust pipeline, is the most important indicator of the strength and durability of our growth outlook.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin was 79.8% in Q2, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges.\nAt our investment community meeting in December, we outlined 5 potential new medicines that could launch over the next 2 years, which could serve as catalysts to driving top-tier growth through the decade.\nThere have been important pipeline development since our Q1 earnings call for all 5, including the U.S. approval and launch of Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes and a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union; FDA acceptance and Priority Review designation for donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; FDA acceptance and Priority Review designation for pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma, for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor; submissions for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis in the EU and in Japan; positive top line 52-week data for lebrikizumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And we also announced U.S., EU and Japan regulatory approval for Olumiant in alopecia areata.\nLast month, we announced plans for a $2.1 billion investment in 2 new manufacturing sites here in Indiana to support increasing demand for existing products as well as demand for potential new medicines in our pipeline. This announcement followed Lilly's recent investments in new facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ireland and will further expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities, such as genetic medicines. These investments underscore our confidence in the growth of our portfolio in the company.\nFinally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders in Q2.\nOn Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates. As previously announced in Q2, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 150,000 doses of bebtelovimab for approximately $275 million in an ongoing effort to provide COVID-19 treatment options for patients. Doses of bebtelovimab valued at approximately $130 million were shipped in Q2, and the remainder of that order will ship in Q3.\nToday, we are announcing that in collaboration with the U.S. government, we intend to begin making bebtelovimab available for purchase by states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor agreement. This will happen later this month, which is prior to the anticipated depletion of the U.S. government's currently available supply.\nAs we move from large ad hoc federal government purchases, the sale and distribution of COVID-19 antibodies to a broader set of purchasers, we will now integrate estimated sales into our forward guidance.\nAs we have said previously, we don't see COVID-19 antibodies as a major long-term driver of growth for the company. Nevertheless, we will continue to do our part where we can to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic with the last monoclonal antibody treatment standing that neutralizes against the Omicron variant.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call over to Anat for a more detailed review of our Q2 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes...\n(technical difficulty)\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nJust continue, Anat, and we'll see what's happening.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nSlide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.\nWe had a few notable items impacting the year-over-year financial comparison. Foreign exchange rates had roughly 300 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as we saw Q2 revenue decline 4% or 1% on a constant currency basis.\nIn Q2 of 2021, we sold our rights to Cialis in China, resulted in $170 million of onetime revenue impact. And this quarter, we also saw the full impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan and have started to see the impact of multiple generic entrants in the U.S.\nWhen excluding revenue...\n(technical difficulty)\nHopefully, everyone on the call can hear us.\n(technical difficulty)\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nOkay.\n(technical difficulty)\nI'll continue and hopefully everyone can hear us.\n(technical difficulty)\nWhen excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Cialis rights in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibodies...\n(technical difficulty)\nOkay. Hopefully, you heard. I will repeat my last sentence. So when excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Cialis rights in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibodies, total revenue grew 6%, highlighting the solid momentum for our core business in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will accelerate in the second half of the year.\nMoving on to gross margin as a percent of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 79.8% in Q2 of 2022. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by product mix and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increase in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation had a modest negative impact on gross margin in Q2.\nTotal operating expenses increased 14% this quarter which, as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, are now inclusive of acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges following guidance from the SEC. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges represented nearly 1,200 basis points of the Q2 OpEx growth.\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven mostly by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 8% driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.\nThis quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $440 million or $0.46 of EPS primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant-selective PI3K alpha inhibitor.\nIn Q2 2021, acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were $43 million or $0.04 of EPS. Operating income decreased 32% in Q2 primarily due to higher acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.5%, which includes the negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to these charges.\nOther income and expense was expense of approximately $13 million this quarter compared with income of $5 million in Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 14.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was driven by favorable tax impacts related to the implementation of a provision of the 2017 Tax Act related to the capitalization of R&D expenses, offset by the tax impact of nondeductible development milestone.\nAt the bottom line, earnings per share declined 32% this quarter, to $1.25 per share. The most significant driver of the year-over-year decline was the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, which had $0.46 negative impact in Q2 of this year compared to $0.04 in Q2 of last year.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 6%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, which declined significantly due to broad generic entry in May and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This volume-driven growth was led by Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance.\nWe experienced a net price decline of 8% for Q2 driven by lower realized prices for Humalog, Alimta and Forteo due to higher rebated segments making slightly larger portion of the business, higher contracted rates and the list price reduction for Insulin Lispro injection this year. Lower realized prices for Taltz were also a driver due to the impact of changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, largely driven by favorable adjustment in the base period and to a lesser extent, continued pull-through of existing access.\nFor the first half of 2022, net price decline in the U.S. was 4%, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline for the full year.\nMoving to Europe. Revenue in Q2 grew 1% in constant currency. Excluding revenue from Alimta, which lost exclusivity in June of 2021, revenue grew 12% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio.\nFor Japan, Q2 revenue decreased 22% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both faced generic entry beginning June 2021. Key growth products represented 69% of total revenue in Japan and grew 11% in Q2 on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023.\nIn China, revenue declined 32% in constant currency driven by the impact of the NRDL formulary access, resulting in lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume for certain newer products, including Verzenio, Tyvyt, Trulicity and Taltz. We also experienced a price decline for Humalog due to the impact of volume-based procurement. We expect improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline over time.\nWith the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China and to subsequent protective measures intended to control the spread of the virus, we have seen lower volume than we otherwise would have expected in Q2, particularly for infused products. For Tyvyt, we are also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency primarily driven by increased sales of key growth products.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline in each of the U.S., EU and Japan and a double-digit price decline in China, resulting in a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits.\nAs shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 18 percentage point of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our overall performance and outlook.\nSlide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 20% or nearly 24% in constant currency, generating $4.3 billion in sales and making up 67% of our core business revenue. We continue to see further growth opportunities for these products.\nFor example, we're extremely pleased to see the strong trajectory of Verzenio driven by the edge of an indication, including recent acceleration in new-to-brand share of market. In the injectable incretin market, we see significant opportunity for further class growth as these medicines currently make up only 25% of total prescription in the U.S. branded diabetes market and have the prospect of expanding the market through the earlier usage for glucose control and weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\nTrulicity is experiencing accelerated demand in many international markets due to market growth and the limited availability of competitor GLP in select markets. We are working to meet this increased demand, while also implementing actions in select countries to manage growth and minimize patient impact. This outlook for Trulicity is included in our guidance.\nLilly is thrilled to have both Trulicity, which has the longest length of therapy of any GLP-1, and Mounjaro, which could offer a step-change in innovation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic indications as options in this class of medicine.\nGiven the excitement and significant interest with the FDA approval of Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, I would like to briefly provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing in terms of early launch. After U.S. approval in mid-May, our full-scale launch began in mid-June. Our commercial team is prepared, energized and observing a high level of engagement across channels as we roll out a patient-centric approach to launching Mounjaro for patients with type 2 diabetes.\nThe financial results you see from Mounjaro today reflect significant utilization of samples, where accepted, and co-pay assistance program to get patients off to a strong start. Peer negotiations are progressing as expected, and we're taking a disciplined approach to establish Mounjaro's access and are focused on delivering the same broad open access which we achieved for Trulicity.\nAs we remain focused on strong execution, we're encouraged by the prescription trends from Mounjaro, including the most recent IQVIA data, showing over 20% share of market for new-to-brand prescriptions in the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class. We are also pleased to see that total Lilly new-to-brand share in the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class has grown nearly 12 percentage points since the launch of Mounjaro.\nGiven the heavy utilization of co-pay cards as we build out access for Mounjaro, prescription trends will likely provide a more accurate measure of launch uptake than net sales over the next few quarters.\nWe are pleased with the initial uptake of Mounjaro, which is at the high end of our contemplated scenarios. We do not anticipate supply constraint for the U.S. launch of Mounjaro, and we will monitor U.S. uptake to determine the appropriate timing for OUS launches.\nAs a reminder, over the last several years, we have made significant investments to grow global manufacturing capacity to support Mounjaro volume, including our new RTP site in North Carolina, which will come online in 2023.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first half of the year, we invested $4.5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain consistent as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.\nSlide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook is unchanged. It now includes an additional $400 million of headwind from foreign exchange rates, since our previous guidance update, for a total impact of roughly $700 million of FX headwind for the full year compared with our original guidance.\nThis incremental headwind is offset by additional forecasted revenue from our COVID-19 antibody, bebtelovimab, which includes $275 million from the U.S. government agreement announced in June of this year as well as estimated revenue from the inception of non-U.S. government distribution that Dave mentioned earlier.\nAs we look ahead, Q3 will mark the first full quarter impact of Alimta U.S. (inaudible). In addition, Q3 of 2021 revenue benefited from Olumiant COVID-19 sales that will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in the quarter.\nOur outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged. While the range is unchanged, SG&A does include additional commercial investments for selected key growth products in the second half of the year.\nOur guidance now include acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $610 million, reflecting total charges in the first half of the year. We have had no material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges at this point in Q3, and this guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions in the second half of the year.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 100 basis points to approximately 27% and 29%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact attributable to foreign exchange rates and acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges to date. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged.\nOn a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $500 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during the second quarter.\nOur tax rate and EPS in the first half of the year still includes the favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year assumes this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year, then we would expect a reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%.\nBased on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.34, to now be in the range of $6.96 to $7.11 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25, to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.05. The $0.25 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange rates as the impact of EPS of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for selected -- and selected products are offset by the impact of additional sales of bebtelovimab.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior VP, Chief Scientific & Medical Officer and President of Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. Looking across Lilly R&D, I continue to be quite encouraged by the potential we have, to turn cutting-edge science into life-changing medicines for patients. This potential is becoming a reality in the late-stage portfolio, where I'll focus my remarks today. But also, it's becoming more and more evident in our earlier-stage projects, and I look forward to providing updates on some of these assets in future quarters.\nGiven updates we provided at ADA in June, including detailed results from SURMOUNT-1, I'll focus today's R&D update on the late-stage progress since our last earnings call more generally.\nSlide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 1, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover both of these slides by therapeutic area.\nStarting with immunology. Along with our partner, Incyte, we're proud that Olumiant has now been approved as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., EU and Japan. Alopecia areata is a significant unmet medical need, and we're delighted about what this medicine could mean for people living with this disease.\nWe also announced top line data from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy maintenance studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which showed 80% of lebrikizumab responders maintained improvements in skin clearance and disease severity at 52 weeks.\nData supported both once every 2-week and once every 4-week maintenance dosing, with consistent and durable responses. We believe the potential for a once every 4-week maintenance dosing regimen could be an important point of differentiation for patients and health care providers.\nLilly is planning submission of lebrikizumab to the FDA in 2022, followed by submissions to other regulatory agencies around the world. Almirall has rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is planning for submission to the EMA in 2022.\nShifting to mirikizumab. We presented results from the Phase III maintenance study, LUCENT-2, at the DDW meeting. This study showed that for patients who responded to treatment on mirikizumab in the 12-week induction period, 50% of patients who received mirikizumab maintenance therapy achieved clinical remission at 1 year compared to 1/4 of patients randomized to placebo.\nIn addition to the U.S. regulatory submission of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis that we announced earlier this year, we have now submitted in the EU and Japan.\nAlso noted here in immunology is a Phase II start for our BTLA agonist antibody in SLE and our new KV1.3 inhibitor shown in Phase I. Our IL-2 conjugate is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Rezpegaldesleukin.\nMoving to diabetes. We're thrilled that Mounjaro is now approved in the U.S. as the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We're pleased to have received a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union, and we're hopeful for full approval by the EMA later this quarter. We presented the exciting detailed results from SURMOUNT-1, evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of weight management and participants with obesity or are overweight at ADA, with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nNew data included an exploratory analysis that showed roughly 40% of patients achieved at least 25% weight reduction on the 15-milligram dose compared to less than 1% of patients on placebo. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in blood pressure and lipids as well as reduction in fat mass that was nearly 3x greater than that in lean mass. Encouraging data also showed that for those patients who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, over 95% returned to normal glucose levels. The efficacy, safety and tolerability data in SURMOUNT-1 exceeded our expectations.\nBased on our existing robust data set for tirzepatide, we have now engaged with the FDA and we'll have a meeting soon to evaluate whether there's a potential path forward to registration for chronic weight management based on SURMOUNT-1, combined with data from the SURPASS program. We'll continue to communicate to investors as there are material updates.\nWe continue to expand our clinical program for tirzepatide, and we have now initiated our Phase III study evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. We also have begun a new trial called SURPASS-EARLY, which evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to standard of care when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetes.\nLater this year, we'll begin [SURMOUNT-5] a head-to-head study comparing weight reduction for tirzepatide versus semaglutide 2.4 milligrams. And finally, later this year, we expect to initiate SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study.\nMoving to our weekly basal insulin Fc, also known as BIF. We have now initiated our second Phase III trial, QWINT-2, which is evaluating BIF compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are starting basal insulin for the first time.\nOur Phase II GGG tri-agonist is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Retatrutide. Also, in this area, 2 assets have now entered Phase I clinical development, our Dual Amylin Calcitonin Receptor Agonist or DACRA and our PNPLA3 sIRNA.\nIn oncology, we are announcing today that the FDA has accepted the filing for pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor, with Priority Review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. Improved treatment options are needed for this challenging disease, and we're encouraged that this potential new medicine could be available to patients in early 2023.\nIn early-phase oncology, we've moved our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor into Phase I development.\nAnd finally, moving to neuroscience. We're also pleased to announce the FDA has accepted the filing for donanemab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and is granted Priority Review designation under an accelerated approval pathway.\nWe continue to look forward to the top line results of the Phase III confirmatory study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, by mid-2023, which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. You also noticed we're now referring to N3pG4 by its nonproprietary name, Remternetug. We plan to initiate the Phase III program for Remternetug in the coming weeks.\nAs you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we have made in the second quarter.\nWe're encouraged by the performance of our key growth products, which now represent 67% of our core business. We expect to see this grow over time as we work to launch more innovative medicines, like Mounjaro.\nExcluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, we expect to see operating margin expansion from both revenue growth and driving further efficiencies in our business. We saw significant progress in our pipeline this quarter with the approvals of Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes and Olumiant in alopecia areata.\nWe also saw progress on our next wave of potential growth catalysts, with the FDA acceptance of donanemab as well as pirtobrutinib and positive top line readout for lebrikizumab and additional submissions for mirikizumab.\nFinally, we returned $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases.\nLooking to the future, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects as we are focused on developing groundbreaking therapies in areas of significant unmet need as well as driving exceptional execution for our recently launched medicines so they reach patients who need them.\nBefore we close, I would like to comment as well. This is Kevin Hern's last call as head of our IR team. And before I turn the call over to him to moderate the Q&A session, I would just like to thank him on behalf of our shareholders, our Board and of course, our executive team and employees. He's done an outstanding job for the last 4.5 years, strengthening our relationships with The Street as well as being an ambassador to both convey the company's messages to shareholders, but also inform management about shareholder perspectives. We wish him the best in his new assignment, transitioning to a leadership role in our U.S. commercial group.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin for his last Q&A session.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Thanks for the kind words. I will definitely miss this.\nWe would like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so please limit your questions to 2 per caller. [Lois], if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.",

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJoining me on today's call are: Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Sara Smith, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Kevin. 2022 is off to a strong start with solid volume-driven revenue growth led by our key products and the new tirzepatide obesity data we announced this morning. We are focused on driving adoption of our newer medicines, preparing for key product launches, delivering several global submissions for potential new medicines, all the while advancing our pipeline to power the next wave of growth. We are pleased with the progress we saw in the first quarter.\nBefore I get to our results, I'd like to take a moment to address the tragic loss of life and the hardships we are seeing in Ukraine. Our Ukraine office is currently closed and operations are suspended. The safety of our employees and their families continues to be our top priority. We are working through logistical challenges in order to ensure supply of our medicines to those in need in Ukraine.\nEarlier this month, an initial shipment of medicine donated by Lilly, including insulin, arrived in Ukraine, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our partners, Project HOPE and Direct Relief. A few of our clinical trial participants are in Ukraine. So while we're doing everything we can to ensure continuity of their medical care, there is minimal impact to our global trials.\nWith regard to Russia, we have suspended investments, our promotional activities and new clinical trials there. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need. Should we generate any profits from our sales in Russia, we will donate them to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of our total company sales in 2021.\nMoving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue grew 15% or 17% on a constant currency basis and was driven by volume growth of 20%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and ALIMTA due to loss of exclusivity, revenue grew 10% for the quarter.\nThis volume-driven performance in Q1 is attributable to our key growth products, which grew 24% and now account for 61% of our core business. With long IP runways for many of these products and less than 10% of our 2022 revenue exposed to patent expiry in the next 5 years, along with the potential to launch 5 new medicines over the next 18 months, the durability of our growth outlook is quite strong.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in Q1, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. Excluding revenue from COVID antibodies, gross margin was approximately 80% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, an increase of roughly 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by both higher gross margin and lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies.\nIn our pipeline, we have several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including: the U.S. and EU approval for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as well as a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee for an early stop to the Phase III trial studying Jardiance for chronic kidney disease due to clear positive efficacy; the U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19; the recent U.S. submission of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-1, the first of four global studies to evaluate tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight.\nDan will talk in more detail later, but we are very excited with the results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-1 top line readout. We believe there is significant potential for tirzepatide to build off the impressive results we saw from our clinical program in type 2 diabetes and help people with obesity, a disease impacting over 110 million people in the United States and approximately 650 million people worldwide. Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease that causes over 2.8 million deaths globally each year.\nThe economic impact associated with obesity is more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. We believe addressing obesity could make a difference in millions of people's lives, have a significant impact on public health and reduce health care costs. We're hopeful that we are entering a new era of obesity care, where people have medicines that can help treat their obesity. And this is our first proof point on that journey.\nWe continue to rapidly advance nucleic acid innovation at Lilly, building on our growing portfolio with the launch of the Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicine, a $700 million facility in Boston. We will develop novel RNA and DNA-based medicines as well as push the boundaries of delivery technology to unlock difficult-to-treat targets in key strategic areas for us like neurodegeneration, diabetes and obesity. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends in the quarter and completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases.\nOn Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates we are discussing today. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review the Q1 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q1, it is important to note that beginning this quarter, following direction from the SEC, presentation of non-GAAP measures will not include upfront charges and development milestones related to acquired in-process R&D and development. While this has no bearing on how we conduct our business, it will have an impact on how we represent -- how we present our non-GAAP measures.\nThis change in presentation of financial results will have the effect of pulling into non-GAAP measures certain charges that were previously reported only in our GAAP financial results. We expect this change will increase non-GAAP operating expenses and decrease non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share. To help with the year-on-year comparison of our non-GAAP measures, you can find a revised workbook in our investor website reflecting the updated presentation of our 2020 and 2021 results.\nSlide 7 summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue grew 15%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and ALIMTA, revenue increased 10%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 70 basis points to 76.1% in Q1 2022.\nThe increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold in Q1 2021, partially offset by increased sales of COVID antibodies, which have lower gross margin profile than the rest of our portfolio and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Increase in manufacturing costs and logistics due to inflation had a modest impact on gross margin in Q1.\nTotal operating expenses decreased 6% this quarter, which, as a reminder, is now inclusive of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% while R&D expenses decreased 4%, driven by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by higher development expenses for late-stage assets.\nThis quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of $166 million or $0.15 of EPS, primarily related to a purchase of a priority review voucher. In Q1, 2021 acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges were $312 million or $0.27 of EPS.\nOperating income increased 66% in Q1, driven by higher revenue, primarily due to higher sales of COVID antibodies, lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies and, to a lesser extent, lower acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 33.4% for the quarter and reflects a benefit from COVID-19 antibody revenue as well as the negative impact of approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges.\nOther income and expense was income of approximately $38 million this quarter compared with income of $35 million in Q1 2021. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 10.3%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter, partially offset by decreased tax expenses related to the implementation of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act requiring to capitalize research and development expenses. At the bottom line, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 63% in Q1, inclusive of approximately 1,500 basis points related to lower acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges.\nOn Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 31%. And when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and ALIMTA, revenue grew 14% in the U.S. This growth was driven by volume, led by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant and Taltz. We experienced a net price decline of 1% for the quarter and continue to expect a mid-single-digit price decline in the U.S. for the full year. As a reminder, a single competitor to ALIMTA launched in the U.S. in February. And we expect broad generic entry in May, resulting in significant erosion of U.S. ALIMTA revenue.\nMoving to Europe. Revenue in Q1 declined 13% in constant currency. And when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and ALIMTA, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. We expect continued growth in Europe, excluding ALIMTA.\nFor Japan, Q1 revenue decreased 21% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and ALIMTA. Key growth products now represent 65% of total revenue in Japan. And we expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023.\nIn China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency. The NRDL access has driven significant volume growth for newer products, like Tyvyt, Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz, and has been partially offset by related price decreases. We expect this improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent protective measures that are currently being put in place to control the spread of the virus highlights the potential for commercial impacts in China in the near term, particularly for our infused products like Tyvyt.\nRevenue in the rest of the world increased 29% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by $95 million in revenue from the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia as well as by increased sales of key growth products. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan with a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits, driven by the expanded NRDL access for our products in China.\nAs shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continued to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 15 percent points of volume growth this quarter and continued to bolster overall performance and outlook.\nSlide 10 further highlights contributions of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands generated $3.9 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue, growing 24%. We're pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders, as well as with the strong Taltz prescription growth. We're also encouraged by the significant uptake of Verzenio in Q1, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions.\nOn Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2022, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.\nSlide 12 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. As I previously noted, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures will now include IP R&D and development milestone charges. For guidance, we will include charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of the earnings release and will not include any impact from potential or pending business development.\nWe're providing information that should make this change as easy as possible to understand as well as incorporate into modeling. As always, please let us know if there's anything else we can do to be of assistance as you navigate through this transition. I do want to reiterate that margin expansion continues to be a priority for our team. Consistent with prior communication, excluding IP R&D and development milestone charges, we expect to drive further non-GAAP operating margin expansion over time.\nGetting into the numbers underlying our updated guidance. There are several items that benefited first quarter results which are not expected to recur. These include: approximately $1.45 billion of COVID antibody sales; U.S. ALIMTA revenue of approximately $250 million that will be impacted by multi-sourced generic entrants in Q2 and beyond; a favorable effective tax rate; and a one-time benefit related to the resolution of cefaclor patent litigation in Canada. I would also remind you that as we look ahead to the second quarter that Q2 2021 revenue benefited from the sale of Cialis rights in China, which will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in Q2.\nStarting with revenue, we are increasing the guidance range by $1 billion to now be in the range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion, reflecting the additional revenue from bebtelovimab sales in Q1. While we project an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate, we are expecting to offset it with stronger core business performance. We anticipate that any additional revenue from sales of COVID-19 antibodies to be limited beginning Q2 2022. While the U.S. government has an option to purchase additional 500,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than July 31 of this year, it is uncertain whether this option will be exercised. And therefore, it is not included in our guidance.\nMoving down the income statement. GAAP gross margin percent is now expected to be approximately 76% while non-GAAP gross margin is now expected to be approximately 78%. The majority of this 200 basis point reduction is due to the impact of Q1 bebtelovimab sales, which has lower gross margin and, to a lesser extent, an increase of approximately $100 million in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation. The range for R&D expenses has been increased by $100 million to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, driven by investment in our late-stage pipeline, primarily Alzheimer's clinical development, and investment to advance the diagnostics ecosystem.\nOur guidance includes acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of approximately $521 million, reflecting Q1 charges of $166 million, with the remainder primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of future obligations that were contingent upon development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant selective PI3K inhibitor. This guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 200 basis points to approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact associated with the acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges to date. Given the accounting change for acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges and the inherent variability associated with such charges, our non-GAAP operating margin figure will not measure efficiency in the same way it has done historically. However, you can track our operating margin in the way you deem most appropriate, knowing that we aim to expand operating margin over time, excluding acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges.\nOur Q1 2022 tax rate and EPS include a favorable impact from the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year is unchanged and assumed that this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rates to be approximately 10% to 11%. It is notable that while this provision favorably impacts certain tax items, which decrease our effective tax rate, we expect it will increase our 2022 cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.5 million.\nBased on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.70 to now be in the range of $7.30 to $7.45 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.15 to $8.30. That $0.35 reduction in our non-core -- in our non-GAAP EPS range includes a $0.55 decrease due to the year-to-date acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges, partially offset by improved business performance of $0.20 attributable to the net benefit of Q1 bebtelovimab sales and increased investments in R&D.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior VP, Chief Scientific & Medical Officer and President of Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive top line results from the tirzepatide SURMOUNT-1 Phase III study.\nParticipants without type 2 diabetes who have obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 52 pounds. Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicine to deliver more than 20% weight loss on average in a Phase III study. Indeed, most people on 10 or 15 milligrams of tirzepatide in this trial achieved 20% or greater weight loss and up to 63% of patients on 15 milligrams achieved this level of weight reduction.\nObesity is a chronic disease that needs more effective treatment options for patients. We're working hard at Lilly to create new potentially innovative medicines with the aim to modernize how this disease is approached. We hope that tirzepatide can be Lilly's first such medicine. And the SURMOUNT program has been designed to test just that. I'll cover this SURMOUNT-1 results in more detail. But first, let me quickly provide an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program.\nThe SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 6 studies, 4 of which are global registration studies. On Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for those 4 global registration studies. All 4 studies compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.\nSURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo to provide weight reduction and safety data for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. SURMOUNT-2 will provide weight reduction and safety data for people with obesity or overweight with type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program. And SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. We expect the remaining 3 global studies to read out in the middle of 2023.\nNote that dose escalation in the SURMOUNT program is consistent with that of the SURPASS program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide. Patients start with 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide and move up every 4 weeks in 2.5-milligram increments to reach their target dose. In SURMOUNT-3 and 4, study participants will escalate to the maximum tolerated dose of either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams. Patients escalating to the maximum tolerated dose provides the opportunity to evaluate the full potential for weight reduction.\nStudies vary in duration from 72 to 88 weeks. And SURMOUNT-1 will continue through 176 weeks to evaluate whether tirzepatide can actually slow the time to onset of type 2 diabetes in participants who had prediabetes at the time of entering the clinical trial. We believe this will be important additional information for patients and physicians.\nSURMOUNT-1, a large trial, which enrolled over 2,500 participants met its co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary end points. On Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-1 study, where tirzepatide delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight. With a mean baseline weight across the study of 231 pounds, this translates into a mean body weight reduction of 52 pounds on the 15-milligram treatment arm of the study. Along with the impressive results from the 10-milligram dose, which showed 21.4% mean body weight reduction, we were also very pleased to see how well the 5-milligram arm performed with a 16% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimate.\nMoving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide obviously achieved the second co-primary endpoint of driving at least 5% weight reduction. Clearly, the vast majority of subjects, including greater than 96% of participants in the 10- and 15-milligram arms, achieved this level of weight reduction. We're really excited that a key secondary endpoint in SURMOUNT-1 showed up to 63% of patients achieved at least 20% body weight reduction at 72 weeks, again using the efficacy estimate. This is compared to only 1% of participants who achieved greater than 20% weight loss on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise.\nMoving to Slide 16. You could see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-1 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for the treatment of obesity. As in the SURPASS program, the most common reported adverse events were GI-related, generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred during dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were between 4.3% and 7.1% for tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 2.6% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates range from roughly 14% to 16% in the tirzepatide arms compared to over 26% for placebo.\nThe minimal weight loss seen in the placebo treatment group, combined with the observed placebo discontinuation rate of 26%, demonstrates the limited efficacy of diet and exercise alone and highlights the significant unmet medical need for people with this disease. We'll continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-1 study data and are planning to present findings at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. And of course, we plan to submit our manuscript to a top-tier peer-reviewed journal.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, obesity is a chronic disease impacting over 110 million Americans. And there is great need for more effective treatment options. While our current alignment with the FDA is to complete the 4 SURMOUNT global registrational studies prior to submission, we believe the impressive results from SURMOUNT-1 warrant further discussion. Based on our existing robust data set, we're looking forward to reviewing the data with the FDA and discussing the potential for an expedited path forward for this indication.\nMoving to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 27 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several other important developments since our last earnings call. And I'll cover these by therapeutic area.\nIn diabetes, along with our partner, Boehringer Ingelheim, we're proud of the expanded indication for Jardiance as a treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which has been classified as the single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. Jardiance is now the first and only heart failure therapy to demonstrate a statistically significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, regardless of ejection fraction.\nWe also announced the Phase III trial study in Jardiance for chronic kidney disease will stop early due to clear positive efficacy. The recommendation was made by an independent data monitoring committee. And while we've not yet seen results from this interim analysis, we're excited about the potential for this new indication and expect to share detailed results from the upcoming primary analysis at a medical meeting in the second half of this year.\nLast month, we began dosing patients in the first of five Phase III trials for investigational weekly insulin basal insulin Fc, or BIF. The QWINT-3 trial compares weekly BIF to insulin degludec, where patients are currently treated with basal insulin. We intend to start the other four Phase III trials later this year. You'll also see we've advanced our long-acting amylin receptor agonist to Phase I development in obesity.\nShifting to immunology. We presented mirikizumab induction data from LUCENT-1 at the European Crohn's and Colitis Virtual Congress, demonstrating superiority over placebo for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. These data show patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis achieved statistically superior rates of clinical remission compared to patients taking placebo with nearly 2/3 of patients responding to mirikizumab. The results indicated improved symptom relief, including decreased bowel urgency and resolution or near resolution of inflammation.\nBuilding upon the positive outcomes from LUCENT-1, we look forward to sharing maintenance data from LUCENT-2 later in Q2. We're also excited to announce that we've submitted to the FDA and expect submissions in Europe and Japan in Q2. Mirikizumab has the potential to be the first-in-class IL-23p19 inhibitor treatment for people with ulcerative colitis.\nLast month, at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, we shared lebrikizumab monotherapy data, showing more than 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis experienced at least 75% reduction in disease severity at 16 weeks. Additionally, at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference, we shared data showing 70% of patients receiving lebrikizumab combined with topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75% improvement in overall disease severity.\nWe believe these data could help establish a competitive profile for lebrikizumab. And we're looking forward to further data from our maintenance studies in the first half of this year to provide insight into the durability of efficacy. Global submissions are expected by year-end.\nMoving to baricitinib. The FDA review for alopecia areata is underway. And we're pleased to note that the FDA has granted priority review designation. As expected, we also received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for baricitinib atopic dermatitis indication as we were not in alignment with the agency on the indicated population.\nFinally, in immunology, we have discontinued the Phase II study for IL-2 in ulcerative colitis due to a lack of efficacy based on interim analysis. The safety was consistent with that observed in previous studies. And this decision does not impact the ongoing or planned studies for IL-2 in SLE or atopic dermatitis as each disease state evaluates a different clinical hypothesis.\nMoving on to neuroscience and the national coverage determination issued earlier this month for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid. We share the disappointment of patients and their caregivers with this NCD. And we know, more generally, that innovation in new medical areas nearly always starts with data that are less proven and more debated and may proceed initially through regulatory mechanisms such as accelerated approval. We believe that Medicare's decision to use CED in such circumstances is in conflict with FDA's and Congress' intent of expedited regulatory pathways and is likely to have a stifling effect on innovation for new medical areas, causing harm to patients that are waiting and in need of new medicines.\nThat said, we're continuing with our rolling submission to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We intend to complete our initial submission yet in Q2, enabling a potential regulatory decision in early 2023. We believe it would be beneficial for donanemab to obtain accelerated approval proximal to the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III readout in mid-2023, which would enable parallel discussions with CMS regarding outright coverage and expedited review time for full FDA approval.\nWe believe that given the thoughtful and robust design of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, if the study is positive, it should meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS in the NCD decision. At that time, we will advocate for CMS to reconsider outright coverage of donanemab. As we stated previously, it's inconceivable to us that once substantial evidence of clinical benefit has been established for any Alzheimer's medicine, people with the disease won't have access to it. Our view of the mid- and long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged.\nShifting now to oncology with pirtobrutinib. We are also working on a rolling submission here under the accelerated approval pathway, in this case, for mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we also expect to complete our initial submission in Q2. We received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding the submission for sintilimab, which was in line with our expectation after the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting earlier this year. Along with Innovent, we're assessing next steps for sintilimab in the U.S.\nFurther, in the oncology pipeline, we started two additional Phase III studies. The first is an additional study evaluating Verzenio in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant following progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. The second is CYCLONE 3 evaluating Verzenio in earlier lines of prostate cancer.\nWe've also advanced our next-generation RET inhibitor to Phase I development. And we've discontinued our Aurora A kinase inhibitor as we did not see sufficient monotherapy activity to warrant further development. Similarly, in our pain therapeutic area, we have decided to discontinue development of epiregulin and TGF-alpha because it did not meet criteria for proceeding.\nFinally, as Dave mentioned earlier, the FDA authorized bebtelovimab for emergency use for certain nonhospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Bebtelovimab neutralizes Omicron, including the BA.2 sublineage as demonstrated by pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization assays.\nAs you can see, Q1 was another busy but successful quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made this year.\nWe delivered solid sales growth, driven largely by volume from our key growth products, which represents 61% of our core business. We continue to see opportunity for meaningful operating margin expansion over time, excluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. We made significant progress developing new medicines with exciting advances, including for Jardiance in HFpEF, the EUA authorization for bebtelovimab, the submission of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis as well as positive base results for tirzepatide in obesity and Jardiance in chronic kidney disease. Finally, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase.\nWe are committed to invest for the long term to advance promising R&D opportunities and support launches to bring groundbreaking therapies to patients diagnosed with some of the most challenging diseases facing human kind, like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, cancer and autoimmune disorders. With the progress we've seen to date, we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth prospects.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. (Operator Instructions) Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Lauren Zierke, Kento Ueha and Sara Smith of the Investor Relations team.\nDuring this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Kevin. 2021 was another outstanding year for Lilly as we delivered strong top and bottom line growth and positive pivotal readouts for 5 important assets with the potential to launch in the next 2 years. As we move into 2022, we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth, expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs.\nUnpacking our 2021 performance on Slide 4, you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Q4 revenue was 8% and was driven by volume growth of 11%. While when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. This volume-driven performance is attributable to our key growth products, which grew by 28% and now account for 61% of our core business in Q4.\nOn our non-GAAP, gross margin was 76.1% in Q4, a decrease of approximately 250 basis points, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 antibodies, which have a lower gross margin profile. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%, representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned.\nFor pipeline milestones, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call, including additional positive Phase III readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. The initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for pertibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelizumab to the FDA for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19.\nWe also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both North Carolina and Ireland. These investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long-term growth. In addition, this quarter, we announced a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities.\nFinally, on financials, we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And in Q4, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another $750 million in share repurchases.\nMoving to Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and COVID-19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our December 15 Investment Community Meeting.\nSo now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2021 results.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave.\nSlide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2021. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q4, revenue grew 8% and revenue, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, increased 6%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Full year revenue growth was 10% on that latter basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76.1% in Q4. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies, with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, also having lower gross margin profile compared to bevalinuzumab sales in the base period.\nTotal operating expenses grew 5% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D expenses increased 7%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage pipeline opportunities, including donanemab, pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide, which were partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. We invested approximately $40 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q4, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $400 million for the full year.\nOperating income increased 3% compared to Q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31.7% for the quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent, partially offset by lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Full year operating margin was 29.9%, in line with our expectations. Other income and expense was an expense of approximately $7 million this quarter compared to an expense of $31 million in Q4 2020.\nOur Q4 effective tax rate was 10.3%, a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits. At the bottom line, we delivered solid growth as earnings per share increased 8% in Q4 and 20% for the full year.\nOn Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This growth driven by volume was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. The net price decline of 2% in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. For the full year, our U.S. net price decrease of 1% was in line with our expectations.\nMoving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 declined 3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, revenue grew 11% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe, and expect continued growth, excluding Alimta.\nIn Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 14% in constant currency. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including Cymbalta and Alimta as well as by the COVID pandemic. With key growth products now representing 56% of total Japan revenue, we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023.\nIn China, revenue grew 13% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity as well as the timing of supply for Cialis through the third-party selling the product. Q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 NRDL price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for Tyvyt.\nIn 2022, we expect the NRDL price reduction headwind largely offset volume growth in Q1, but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions. Moving forward, we're excited about the significant growth we're seeing in China, over 40% in constant currency in 2021, with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth.\nRevenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan. In China, the expanded NRDL access for our products should lead to significant volume increase, but also high double-digit decline in price. As a result, we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022.\nAt the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021, which shows strong double-digit volume-driven revenue growth across most major geographies.\nAs shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook.\nSlide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands generated over $4.2 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue. In Q4, these newer medicines grew by 28% and Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio, all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and the SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders. We are also encouraged by the strong uptake of Verzenio we saw in Q4, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2021, we invested $9.3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately $1.3 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches, invest in our pipeline, evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.\nOn Slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in December. As I shared then, the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in Europe and Japan will continue in the first half of 2022. While the impact from Alimta's U.S. patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in Q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in Q2.\nWe expect roughly $375 million of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in Q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last November's U.S. government purchase agreement. We continue to invest in our bright future, advance in promising R&D opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky\n\nSenior VP, Chief Scientific Officer & President of Lilly Research Labs, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThank you, Anat.\n2021 was a remarkable year for Lilly's pipeline. We delivered positive data on 5 molecules: tirzepatide, tenenumab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, all of which have the potential to launch in the next 2 years, and we're excited about the potential of these molecules hold for patients. In addition, we launched and submitted several key new indications for in-market products, including important new indications for Verzenio and Jardiance. And also, we advanced our early-stage pipeline.\nJust a few weeks ago, we provided an extensive R&D update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from Lilly. As a result, today's R&D update will be brief and focus on the progress we've made since our last earnings call.\nSlide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 31, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022. In Diabetes, with the recent submission in Japan, we've now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year. We anticipate U.S. regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from SURMOUNT-1, both by midyear.\nIn Japan, we submitted Jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for Jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\nMoving to Oncology. We shared encouraging updated data at ASH for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. We continue to progress this molecule and initiated another Phase III study in first-line CLL comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy. During our December meeting, we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for MCL in the U.S. We plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023, and we're excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated timeline.\nFor Verzenio, we received approval for high-risk early breast cancer in Japan for the Cohort 1 population study to monarchE and are pleased that this approval represents 90% of the intent-to-treat population. We've also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the Phase III study of Verzenio for HR+, HER2- early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges. Importantly, this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer.\nIn addition, we began a Phase III study for selpetatinib for the treatment of adjuvant RET-positive non-small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the U.S. trial of our BCL-2 inhibitor.\nIn Immunology, we announced positive top line data for our Phase III maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. We're pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year. We also announced positive top line Phase III results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, and we're encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis. We await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions, which are expected by the end of 2022.\nMoving to baricitinib. We announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from 2 Phase III trials, we've decided to discontinue the Phase III development program for lupus. For atopic dermatitis in the U.S., we're in ongoing discussions with the FDA, but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population, which could possibly lead to a complete response letter. We expect regulatory action for this indication very soon. Finally, we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the U.S. and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year.\nIn our early phase immunology portfolio, we started a new Phase I study for CD19 antibody, and we've discontinued our oral IL-17 inhibitor.\nMoving to neurodegeneration. In our early-phase pipeline, we announced that we've received breakthrough therapy designation for N3pG4, an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year. We have evidence that this therapy is completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque, and we're exploring flexible dosing regimens, including subcutaneous dosing.\nFor the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we also began a Phase II trial for our oglic/nacase inhibitor, an oral small molecule targeting tau. While donanemab has been a primary focus for investors, we're pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline.\nNow turning to donanemab, in December, we initiated 2 additional Phase III studies, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, our prevention study for asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head plaque clearance study compared to add-a-helm. It's been less than 1 year since we published a positive randomized controlled TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function. Since then, we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well-designed expanded Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid-2023.\nWhile a lot has happened in this space during this last year, and more events are likely before we get top line results next year, what hasn't changed for us is the importance of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design. Given the impact of this devastating disease, we believe that if TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 provides positive confirmatory data, we can't see a scenario where there's not global reimbursement, patient access and broad use of donanemab.\nWe noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory Phase III data in mid-2023. We're disappointed with the position that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision, and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout if reconsideration of CMS coverage determination is required, given historical timelines for this process. While the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the FDA to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials, the NCD is currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in Alzheimer's disease.\nStill, we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year, but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of Q1. We expect further volatility and expectations as competitor Alzheimer's disease trials read out prior to our definitive data. We remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. And importantly, the long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged.\nLastly, with respect to our progress with COVID-19 therapies. Earlier this year, we submitted a request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelimumab for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 and for patients at high risk for progression of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This is the third antibody we've developed for the treatment of COVID-19, and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern. We've produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives EUA from the FDA.\nIn addition, we've also submitted a supplemental NDA for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year. Baricitinib currently has an EUA for this indication. We're proud of the therapies we've delivered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we'll continue to do our part as public health needs emerge.\nIn summary, Q4 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly, capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Ricks\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dan.\nBefore we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2021. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive Phase III data for 5 new potential medicines: tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next 2 years. We also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for Jardiance and Verzenio, while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities. Finally, we returned $4.35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fourth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase.\nAs we move into 2022, we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow, starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. These opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, cancers and autoimmune disorders. We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients who rely on us and are confident in our business outlook.\nSo now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nVP of IR, Eli Lilly and Company\n\nThanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible. (Operator Instructions) Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.",

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Martina Cheung, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Aboaf, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing non-GAAP adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP that corresponds to the non-GAAP measures we are providing, and the press release and the supplemental deck contain reconciliations of such GAAP and non-GAAP measures. The financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise.\nI would also like to call your attention to certain European regulations. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company. We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Martina Cheung. Martina?\n\nMartina L. Cheung\n\nPresident-Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. In the third quarter, we delivered record revenue, record operating profit and record EPS. On every headline financial metric, it was the strongest quarter we've ever had. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with subscription revenue increasing 6%. We continue to make important strategic investments while focusing on productivity and disciplined execution. This allowed us to deliver 180 basis points of margin expansion on a trailing 12-month basis, and increase our adjusted EPS by 22%. We also returned nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks since our last earnings call.\nWe're also announcing today that we expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion share repurchase during the fourth quarter following our Investor Day. This will allow us to return approximately 85% of 2025 adjusted free cash flow while still using the net proceeds from the OSTTRA divestiture for additional share repurchases. We now expect to fund the acquisition of With Intelligence through a combination of $1 billion in incremental debt and cash on hand.\nThe double-digit revenue growth in our Ratings and Indices businesses really highlight the incredible value of our global franchises. The investments we've made in prior years, particularly in capacity, new products and technology allow us to efficiently meet market demand in these periods of favorable market conditions.\nMarket Intelligence also saw another quarter of revenue acceleration on both a reported and organic basis. Improvements in productivity and execution have supported the acceleration of revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results the teams are delivering.\nWe've been focused on innovation across the company, and we made some very exciting announcements recently that we believe will accelerate our leadership in strategically important areas. As I'll discuss in a moment, we've announced a number of important advancements in AI. We also announced the planned acquisition of With Intelligence, and we announced an exciting partnership with both Cambridge Associates and Mercer. This multipronged approach to innovation and growth allows us to be nimble and decisive in our approach to strategic growth and combine assets in unique ways to serve our customers.\nWe also wanted to call attention to our progress in artificial intelligence. And later in the call, I'll give a bit of a preview into some of what we'll be discussing at Investor Day. This morning, we announced in our press release that we have signed an agreement to divest our enterprise data management and businesses subject to customary closing conditions. This is a continuation of our efforts to streamline and simplify our business while making sure that our products and services are strategically aligned. We will always strive to be good stewards of our portfolio of businesses, and we may continue to make tactical divestitures from time to time. However, with these announcements, we can say that this multiyear exercise of portfolio optimization within Market Intelligence is substantially complete.\nBefore I get into further details of our performance this quarter, I want to touch on some leadership announcements we've made recently. First, Dandri Bird and Swamy Kocherlakota will be departing as previously announced, and second, Mark Aramo will be retiring. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to each of them for their meaningful contributions and leadership over the years and for their help to ensure a smooth transition.\nWith Mark's retirement, Dave Ernsberger will assume the role of sole President of Commodity Insights. We're also thrilled to welcome Catherine Clay as the new CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices, who will be joining next week.\nNow turning to the current market conditions. Billed Issuance increased 13% year-over-year in the quarter, with particular strength in high-yield and structured finance. Equity markets continued to perform well in the third quarter as equity prices and equity inflows, both contributed to a very strong quarter in our Indices business. With volatility tempering from the elevated levels we saw in the second quarter, our ETG growth moderated somewhat as well, but remained positive against a difficult compare from last year. While we have seen some pull forward of high-yield refinancing from the 2026 maturity wall, we remain encouraged by the fact that for high yield specifically, the Q4 maturity wall is 6% higher than what we saw at this point last year, while the 1-year forward maturity wall also remains healthy.\nIn investment grade, the Q4 roll is very modestly lower than what we saw last year, while the 1-year forward maturity roll is still higher. Our outlook for the rest of the year assumes Billed Issuance growth in the mid- to high teens range in the fourth quarter and assumes that U.S. equity markets are flat from September 30. Eric will walk through what that means for guidance in a moment.\nNow turning to some very exciting news from earlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of With Intelligence, which we expect to close by early 2026, subject to customary conditions. With Intelligence brings an incredible amount of differentiated data on private markets, including extensive data and private equity, private credit, infrastructure, hedge funds and family offices. Importantly, this data is sourced directly from asset allocators and fund managers. S&P Global can combine that contributory data with our already massive data estate covering more than 50 million private companies. Our pricing and valuation data from MI, Credit Ratings and Estimates, energy data from CI and infrastructure and data center information from 451 Research. This unique combination of differentiated private markets data will allow S&P Global to provide essential intelligence to customers that they will not be able to get from any other provider.\nThe team at With Intelligence has built a truly incredible company, and we believe that we will be able to accelerate the growth of With Intelligence as part of S&P Global's Market Intelligence division. Our goal is to create the most comprehensive solution for private market participants anywhere in the world. We're excited to tell you more about our long-term vision for private markets at Investor Day in a couple of weeks, but this acquisition helps us take another meaningful step towards turning that vision into reality. The acquisition of With Intelligence is just one of the many ways we are adding to innovation. In the last few months, we've also made some very exciting announcements around our organic product innovation.\nIn the third quarter, we announced AI-powered document search within iLEVEL. This comes quickly after the launch of automated data ingestion or ADI, in iLEVEL earlier this year. iLEVEL is already the leading platform for private markets portfolio monitoring. And while ADI made it easier for users to bring new data into the platform, Document Search makes it easier for them to get portfolio intelligence out of the platform.\nJust last week, we announced the launch of Document Intelligence 2.0 within Capital IQ Pro. The new Document Intelligence allows users to extract real insights across multiple documents simultaneously. We've brought deep research functionality and allowed users to leverage that within our data and content without ever having to leave the Capital IQ platform. Users can now analyze multiple documents from different sources, including filings, transcripts, investor presentations, news and proprietary research, all simultaneously through a familiar conversational interface. We're not just making our products better either, we're also innovating new ways to let users interact with our data and content.\nIn recent months, we've announced collaborations with Microsoft Anthropic. Google, Salesforce, IBM and others, to make sure that wherever our customers are working, they are doing it with S&P Global's differentiated data. While still in early stages and with strong IP protections in place, we view these collaborations as important ways to reach new customers and help our existing customers to get the most out of the leading tools in the market. We'll have demos of all of these innovations available in the product showcase at our Investor Day in just a few weeks.\nBack in September, we announced a strategic collaboration with investment firms, Cambridge Associates and Mercer to deliver comprehensive private markets performance analytics, and we expect to launch a beta by year-end. We also announced the collaboration with Centrifuge to bring the S&P 500 Index on chain, expanding access to the world's most widely recognized benchmark. Centrifuge is a decentralized infrastructure provider specializing in real-world asset integration. And this collaboration lets us enter the fund tokenization space by licensing the S&P 500 Index.\nIn addition to the acquisition of With Intelligence, we also recently announced the completion of our acquisition of ARC Research. ARC Research is the leading independent provider of investment performance data benchmarking capabilities and insights in the private wealth market. It maintains the world's largest proprietary data set of more than 500,000 private client portfolios with decades of history. We're thrilled to add ARC Research's impressive capabilities to our wealth initiatives within S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nWe continue to look for new ways to meet our customers' needs and these recent announcements of organic innovation, strong partnerships and the acquisition of truly differentiated assets are all examples of S&P Global driving greater customer value. We're seeing that show up in our customer conversations as well.\nIn the third quarter, we had another major investment bank adopt Capital IQ Pro as its primary desktop solution in a competitive displacement, driven by the value in our data transparency, modeling flexibility and strategic support through a full migration to Capital IQ Pro, Visible Alpha and our GenAI capabilities. We also had a very strong expansion with a large global asset manager in the quarter where we were able to demonstrate clear customer value across multiple products, particularly within the software solutions of Market Intelligence and more than triple the total value of the contract. Perhaps the best example of S&P Global moving from strength to strength is in the area of artificial intelligence. S&P moved early and powerfully into the AI space many years ago, and we have continued to grow the business profitably ever since. As many of our investors will recall, we acquired Kensho back in 2018, including that acquisition since 2018, we have invested over $1 billion in AI innovation across three developmental stages.\nFrom 2018 through 2021, we invested to build out foundational capabilities through products like Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, Kensho Nerd and Kensho Extract. These tools have enabled us to look across our global data estate, scrub, process of tag data and link that data across multiple data sets. We can also create machine-readable files from unstructured data like audio recordings of earnings transcripts and automate the ingestion and tagging of new data sets. These foundational capabilities are incredibly important in a world where machine-readable metadata is a prerequisite for usage of any data in LLM.\nIn 2022, we shifted to early innovation in GenAI. With the advent of large language models, our early actions in AI positioned us very well to leverage our expertise in the field and find exciting applications of LLMs in our ecosystem. We launched the first version of Document Intelligence as well as ChatIQ within Capital IQ Pro and conversational search in our S&P Global marketplace. As more and more of our customers were coming to us for help finding ways to marry S&P data with the rapidly evolving technology, we accelerated the deployment of GenAI in our products over the last 3 years.\nYou can see that on the slide, almost all of the new GenAI-powered products, features and enhancements were both leveraging the foundational AI technology built by Kensho over the past 7 years. Importantly, our AI innovation serves as a powerful example of our ability to leverage our scale, our expertise and our fiscal discipline. The fact that we made such bold investments early on means that we've been able to innovate very efficiently from a financial perspective.\nAside from 2022, we have delivered meaningful margin expansion every year since we acquired Kensho in 2018 while still accelerating our AI innovation. We are confident we'll be able to continue driving both technological innovation and margin expansion in the years to come, which brings me back to our stellar financial results in the third quarter. Eric will provide more details shortly, but our results in the third quarter really spotlight the hard work, dedication and spectacular execution of our teams around the world. Not only did we see accelerating revenue growth for S&P Global but we saw another consecutive quarter of acceleration in MI on both a reported and an organic basis. We also achieved meaningful margin expansion on a trailing 12-month basis in every single one of our divisions. We are pleased with the results in the quarter and look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in just a couple of weeks. Eric, over to you.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Martina, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 12. The third quarter demonstrated the power of our business as we delivered accelerating revenue growth and very significant margin expansion while still reinvesting in product innovation. Reported and organic constant currency revenue both grew 9%, while expenses grew 2%, enabling us to deliver 330 basis points of year-on-year margin expansion to 52.1%. Excluding the contribution from OSTTRA, which was divested earlier this month, adjusted margins would have been 51.6% and margin expansion would have been slightly higher.\nThrough our disciplined execution and continued capital returns, we delivered 22% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. While this slide demonstrates the diversity of our revenue streams across the divisions, we also want to provide some additional insight into the different types of products and services that generate that revenue for us. The majority of our revenue comes from the benchmarks we provide, all of Ratings, all of Indices, all of Platts within Commodity Insights as well as the distribution of our Ratings content through credit and risk solutions in MI. We also generate revenue from workflow tools and software by Capital IQ and the Enterprise Solutions business in Market Intelligence, and a portion of the Upstream business and Commodity Insights.\nOur proprietary content, research and data sets as well as data that is heavily curated, enhanced and linked makes up the rest of the Commodity Insights and a large portion of MI's data analytics and Insights business. What is left is data that is publicly available and not materially enhanced by S&P Global. That portion makes up about 12% of Market Intelligence and less than 5% of the company's total revenue. That means that over 95% of the revenue is derived from proprietary sources and the value that we generate for our customers really can't be replicated by any other single company. We plan to provide more detail around this breakdown at our Investor Day, where we thought it would be helpful in the current environment to at least provide this early view.\nSlide 13 illustrates the progress we are making in key strategic growth areas. Energy transition and sustainability revenue grew 6% to $96 million in the quarter, driven by demand for Data and Insights from Commodity Insights and Sustainability products in our Indices division.\nMoving to Private Markets. Our revenue growth doubled from last quarter, accelerating to 22% year-over-year to $164 million. Growth was primarily driven by Ratings benefiting from strength in private debt issuance and middle-market CLOs. S&P is committed to bringing increased transparency to the private markets and our acquisition of With Intelligence as well as our recent partnerships will enable us to further deliver on this mission while reinforcing our leadership position and accelerating our revenue growth.\nWe are very excited to announce that in the third quarter, we achieved our merger revenue synergy target on a run rate basis, well in advance of the timeline we laid out back in 2022. We exited the quarter with $255 million of run rate synergies and thus no longer expect to report on these synergies going forward.\nFinally, our ability to innovate across our business remained a key growth driver in the third quarter. We continue to deliver a Vitality Index at or above our 10% target.\nTurning to our divisions. On Slide 14, Market Intelligence accelerated revenue growth on both a reported and organic basis in the third quarter. We're particularly encouraged by the 8% organic constant currency growth, which represents the strongest organic growth in MI in 6 quarters. Continued strength in subscription was augmented by double-digit growth in our volume-driven products. We look forward to finishing the year strong.\nData Analytics and Insights had revenue growth of 5%, with organic revenue growth up 6% year-over-year, aided by especially strong demand for industry and company data. Enterprise Solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the secondary loan markets and strong demand for our lending workflow solutions as well as robust growth in subscription products. Reported revenue growth of 9% included the impact of $10 million in Fincentric revenue in the year ago period. Excluding that impact, organic growth accelerated to 13% year-over-year. Credit and Risk Solutions grew 6% on a reported and organic basis, continuing to benefit from demand for Ratings data feeds that are catering to client needs for digitization and automation.\nAdjusted expenses increased 1% year-over-year, largely driven by higher base compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and elevated incentive compensation last year. This resulted in Market Intelligence's very significant operating margin expansion of 360 basis points to 35.6%.\nWe are raising the low end of the guidance range for revenue growth given the acceleration in organic growth we've seen over the last 2 quarters. While we continue to expect some incremental investment expense to land in the fourth quarter, we are raising our guidance range for MI margins by 75 basis points at the midpoint for the full year.\nNow turning to Ratings on Slide 15. In the third quarter, strong investor demand and resilient market sentiment contributed to a favorable financing environment and supported our growth in issuance volumes. Ratings revenue increased 12% year-over-year, well above our internal expectations and with the growth balance between both transaction and nontransaction revenues. Transaction revenue grew 12% in the third quarter, benefiting from a particular strength in high-yield and bank loan issuance. Favorable market conditions supported refinancing activity as high-yield issuers took advantage of spreads and we continue to see elevated demand in structured finance.\nNontransaction revenue also increased by 12% driven primarily by higher annual fee revenue. Contributions from initial Issuer Credit Ratings or ICR and Rating Evaluation Services, or RES, were both above our expectations as well. In fact, the third quarter was a record for us in RES revenue.\nAdjusted expenses declined 4% based on the lapping of elevated incentive compensation last year and continued productivity improvements. This contributed to the division's 540 basis points of margin expansion to 67.1%. We are raising our outlook to reflect the third quarter's outperformance and our assumption of continued favorable market conditions in the fourth quarter. We expect Billed Issuance growth in the mid- to high teens range in the fourth quarter, driven by continued refinancing activity and opportunistic issuance. While we expect M&A volumes to improve going forward, we continue to expect 2025 volumes to be below historical norms, including in the fourth quarter.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights on Slide 16. Revenue increased 6%, largely driven by the 8th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Energy & Resources, Data & Insights. Energy & Resources Data & Insights and Price Assessments grew 11% and 7%, respectively. Our commercial momentum persists as we continue to transition more customers to enterprise contract relationships though growth was somewhat tempered by the incremental sanctions we called out last quarter. As I'm sure many of you saw, United States recently introduced additional sanctions just last week, and I'll walk you through the expected impact shortly.\nAdvisory and transactional services revenue grew 4%. We had another record quarter in Global Trading Services. However, we continue to see the impact of headwinds we called out last quarter primarily in consulting and nonsubscription revenue associated with the uncertainty in the energy markets. Upstream Data and Insights revenue declined 2% year-over-year as expected. The decline was driven by customer consolidation in the energy space and lower oil prices weighed on discretionary spending. We expect these headwinds to persist through the fourth quarter and likely into next year.\nThe Upstream business has some truly valuable and differentiated data, and we're working diligently to help our customers realize the value of our offering. As we mentioned last quarter, we are actively intervening by engaging with clients, accelerating product innovations and aligning commercial incentives to stabilize the business and reposition it for growth. Adjusted expenses increased 6%, largely driven by the lap of a onetime credit related to higher royalty and conference costs and higher compensation expense, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 7% and operating margin expanded by 30 basis points year-over-year to 48.1%.\nWe are tightening the ranges for both revenue growth and operating margin for the full year. While we continue to expect strong revenue growth and margin expansion in CI for full year 2025 and beyond, we do expect the modest headwinds we discussed today to persist into at least the early part of next year.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we have seen some additional sanctions introduced recently that could impact our Commodity Insights business. In total, we expect the sanctions introduced since we gave our initial guidance in February that contribute a headwind of approximately $6 million, the Commodity Insights in 2025 and approximately $20 million of headwinds in 2026. This, of course, assumes the current sanctions remain in place and no new sanctions are introduced.\nNow turning to Mobility on Slide 17. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year, highlighting the mission-critical nature of the division's products and strong execution, notwithstanding the ongoing tariff and regulatory uncertainty lingering across the OEM and manufacturing end markets. revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in products such as CARFAX and automotive mastermind. Manufacturing revenue declined 3% year-over-year as tariffs and related uncertainty weighed on consulting revenues and discretionary spending at automotive OEMs. Financials and other increased 12% as the business line continues to benefit from the strong underwriting volumes and commercial momentum.\nAdjusted expenses grew 6%, driven by continued advertising and promotional investment but offset by strong operating leverage and the lapping of elevated incentive compensation last year. Segment margins improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 43.3%. Lastly, we remain on track to meet our key milestones for our spin-off of our Mobility division. We will continue to keep investors updated on the progress of the separation.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices on Slide 18. Revenue increased 11% with double-digit growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from both higher AUM and net inflows and and in data and custom subscription revenue. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees grew 14% in the third quarter. This was driven by higher equity market appreciation and strong net inflows into products based on S&P Dow Jones Indices. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue were up 1% against a difficult year-over-year comparison, supported by higher average daily volumes in our SPX\nData and custom subscriptions increased 10% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts, which posted low double-digit growth and growth in our real-time offerings. Adjusted expenses were up 7% year-over-year, driven by strategic investments, partially offset by lower incentives. Indices operating profit grew 12% and operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 71.2%. Our outlook for 2025 assumes U.S. equity markets are flat from September 30 through the end of the year, and we expect modest year-over-year growth in ETE volumes in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to guidance. Slide 19 outlines our enterprise guidance on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are raising our enterprise outlook for total revenue growth and margins. We now expect total revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, and we expect adjusted margins in the range of 50% to 50.5%. We're also showing guidance for margin ex OSTTRA for year-on-year comparability purposes.\nAs I'll discuss on the next slide, we expect higher revenue growth for Ratings and Indices and we tightened our ranges to the upper end for Market Intelligence and Mobility, while we slightly lowered the higher end of the range for Commodity Insights. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $17.60 to $17.85, 4 percentage points above the initial guidance we provided back in February, and representing growth of 12% to 14% year-over-year. We expect the additional share repurchases we announced this morning to be neutral to adjusted EPS in 2025, given how late we are in the year but we expect a reduction in share count to more than offset the additional interest expense in 2026 and beyond and be slightly accretive to EPS.\nMoving to the division outlook on Slide 20. Our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence was lifted towards the upper end of our prior range to 5.5% to 6.5%, reflecting our strong execution and the acceleration in organic growth year-to-date. For Ratings, based on the current expectation for mid- to high teens Billed Issuance in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, which is above previous guidance, including our outperformance in the third quarter. We trimmed our outlook for Commodity Insights at the upper end of our prior range due to the sanctions and the other factors I discussed previously. For Mobility, we raised the revenue guidance range towards the upper end of our prior range. For Indices, we now expect 10% to 12% revenue growth, reflecting market strength and higher net inflows. Our updated outlook is now well above our initial 8% to 10% outlook in February.\nOn the next slide, we are raising our margin outlook for the enterprise with higher margins in nearly every division as I discussed previously. We are pleased with the financial results the team delivered in the third quarter. These results highlight the vital importance of our products to our customers, especially in the dynamic environment we've seen thus far in 2025. We continue to focus on rapid innovation, prudent strategic investment and disciplined execution. We saw the results of that focus in the third quarter. As we look forward to Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we're excited to tell you more about what's coming next. We have a compelling strategy that we believe will drive revenue growth and margin expansion in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions."

We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our media relations team whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Martina Cheung. Martina?\n\nMartina L. Cheung\n\nPresident-Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. We're pleased with the strong results we saw in the second quarter this year. Revenue increased 6% year-over-year, with subscription revenue increasing 7%. We are balancing important strategic investments with disciplined expense management, which allowed us to deliver 150 basis points of trading 12-month margin expansion. We continue our track record of very strong capital returns, returning nearly $950 million to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Impressive financial results like these are the result of consistent execution across our divisions, but we are particularly pleased with the results we're seeing from our Market Intelligence division, which saw an acceleration to 7% organic constant currency revenue growth and more than 200 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The new leadership team in Market Intelligence has made real progress on a revenue transformation effort, and we are seeing the impact across the global book of business. They have also linked arms with our Chief Client office and embrace the opportunity to help each other engage more deeply with large customers, as I'll discuss in more detail shortly.\nWe also continue to see strong growth in private markets revenue and we'll provide an update on our efforts in our Ratings business today as well. We are pushing forward in exciting ways to expand our leadership in artificial intelligence. In the last few months, we've introduced a number of exciting new products but also reached meaningful milestones with hyperscale partners to expand distribution of our differentiated data and thought leadership content while still preserving our intellectual property and direct customer relationships.\nBefore I move into the deeper discussion of our results, I wanted to provide a quick update on the Mobility separation we announced last quarter. We are excited to announce that Bill Eger, currently CEO of CARFAX, has been named the President of S&P Global Mobility and the CEO Designate for the planned stand-alone public company. Bill is a tremendous leader with over 20 years of experience at CARFAX, and we look forward to introducing him to investors and analysts at the appropriate time. Edouard Tavernier will remain on as a strategic adviser through September 30 of this year. Edouard has been a great partner in our executive leadership team since the merger with IHS Markit. We want to thank him for the incredible leadership and vision he has provided for the Mobility division over the years and wish him all the best going forward.\nShifting to what we're seeing in the markets and the business now. I want to begin with the momentum we've created in our commercial team so far this year. We created the Chief Client Office as part of our leadership transition late last year, and we have seen a very promising first couple of quarters. The CCO is focused on making sure that our largest strategic customer accounts view S&P Global as an essential partner in their success. Currently, about 130 customers are part of our CCO initiative, and we will continue to add customers selectively over time. We're maintaining some flexibility as we continue to learn, but the ultimate goal will be to capture the largest and most strategic relationships we have, while making sure we can still provide individualized attention to these accounts and keep the team relatively small.\nWe've strengthened relationships at the C-suite with these customers, and we've established efficient communication channels with dedicated reps who can help address any subject across all divisions. We continue to focus on increasing awareness with these customers and making sure that they know everything that we can do for them. This is especially impactful when we can align our world-class products with the strategic priorities of our customers, like private markets, wealth management, AI and energy transition. In recent months, we've been able to demonstrate that value clearly to a number of customers, evidenced by a $20 million multiyear contract we signed for direct indexing in the wealth space and the multiyear strategic partnership we announced just last week with Barclays. That contract includes a comprehensive suite of S&P Global products, data and solutions powered by Capital IQ Pro and will support Barclays businesses across the enterprise.\nI also wanted to provide an update on the transformation we're driving in our Market Intelligence division, with 7% organic constant currency revenue growth in the second quarter. It's clear our initiatives are already bearing fruit. Saugata and his team have led a remarkable effort to align the product and commercial teams and improve sales execution and customer engagement. With new leadership across the commercial organization, we have already seen the results of the discipline, operational excellence and focus on execution. We simplified sales incentive programs to better align with our key priorities with respect to customer retention, new sales, pipeline performance and competitive wins.\nBeyond the headline financial metrics, we're also seeing further improvement in retention rates with our net renewal rate up more than 1 full percentage point year-over-year. Our deep engagement with customers is helping them to realize more value from S&P Global products and allowing us to better realize the economics of that value while still improving win rates. Just to offer a few more examples in the second quarter alone. In addition to the deals I already mentioned, the team closed a multimillion dollar deal with a large global technology company that included a 20% increase in annual contract value. Another multimillion dollar deal with a global investment bank that included a 25% increase in ACV and a multimillion dollar expansion deal with a large European bank. This is nowhere near a comprehensive list of wins in the quarter, but highlight the clear trends that we're seeing that our largest customers are looking for ways to consolidate vendors, and they increasingly view S&P Global as a strategic partner that can help them do that.\nWe're excited about what we're seeing in the division and remain confident in our ability to continue accelerating the organic growth and deliver the financial results we've guided to. These results are even more impressive given the uncertainty we saw to start the second quarter. Bill issuance declined 4% year-over-year in the second quarter. As noted in our last call, the issuance environment was negatively impacted by global trade and tariff uncertainty, especially in April. We saw market concerns moderate as we progress through the quarter, leading to better-than-expected bill issuance. Bank-owned bill issuance was materially below the levels we saw in the second quarter of last year. Recall last year's second quarter included a triple-digit increase in bank loan issuance, which we lapped this quarter. Importantly, we saw some recovery in June, which was the second highest June we've seen since at least 2019, coming in just shy of last year's high watermark.\nStructured finance was strong in the second quarter, though we did see a modest decline as we lapped a 60% growth quarter from last year. Equity markets were also stronger than we expected in the second quarter, with U.S. equity markets rebounding quickly from the lows we saw in April. We also benefited from strong net inflows for our indices and strong volumes in our exchange traded derivatives. As Eric will discuss in a moment, our outlook for the rest of the year assumes flat bill issuance in the back half of the year and assumes that U.S. equity markets are flat from June 30.\nTo touch briefly on the broader macroeconomic picture, we're expecting 1 to 2 rate cuts from the U.S. Fed in the second half of the year, and we're expecting a slow but positive GDP growth across all major economic zones. We're also expecting oil prices to be slightly lower in the back half compared to the first half, with dated Brent crude expected to be in the mid-60s.\nNow turning to private credits. While private credit still represents a relatively small portion of our total Ratings revenue, our private credit strategy is an important part of our broader private market initiative. Our total private markets revenue saw solid growth in the second quarter, with the private credit component being a major driver of that growth. For decades, S&P has brought transparency, credibility and objective assessment of risk to the public debt markets, and we are focused on creating that same value in private credit markets. We offer an array of products in private markets including middle market CLO ratings, fund ratings, structured credit ratings, entity ratings, credit estimates and private credit analyses. Crucial to our and our customer success in this market is the fact that our criteria and methodologies are consistent across public and private markets.\nWhen assessing private credit, we utilize the same risk factors that we use to assess public market debt. That consistency across public and private markets empowers us to create similar customer value and realize similar economics across those markets. That consistency is highly valued by the various important stakeholder groups we serve in private credit. We moved early several years ago to engage frequently and deeply with major private market participants to make sure we were well positioned to serve that market.\nWe have very strong relationships with sponsors, bankers, institutional investors and asset owners. These crucial stakeholders frequently reach out to S&P Global to leverage our expertise across the broad spectrum of risk, and we see incredible opportunities to further develop these relationships. We have taken a global approach over the last several years as well. Even before the spike in private credit that began in 2022, we were engaging with stakeholders, not just in the Americas, but also in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia. Regions outside the U.S. and Europe have rapidly developing and evolving credit markets, and there is a growing interest in private markets.\nNow looking to the latest in our AI innovation. In the last few months, we've seen some incredible progress in our AI and data distribution strategy as we work with hyperscale partners across the ecosystem. Through the introduction of AI-ready data sets from all divisions, we're able to make our differentiated data available through hyperscale platforms around the world. We've made our renowned thought leadership content from Commodity Insights available through Copilot, and we announced a collaboration with Anthropic to integrate S&P Global data sets with Claude through the model context protocol, or MCP.\nThrough MCP, Claude users can access our proprietary data sets in real time during conversations but only for S&P Global subscribers. Our data is not part of Anthropics training data. These are just two examples of the many GenAI collaborations, leveraging our model agnostic Kensho LLM-ready API. These integrations require customers to have subscriptions to these data sets from S&P Global, and we maintain both the intellectual property rights and the direct customer relationships. We're really excited about the growth opportunities these partnerships present as we look to give customers access to our data and products wherever they want to work. Ultimately, we may also see new customers accessing content over these channels.\nWe also launched the GenAI powered Credit Companion for Ratings Direct on Capital IQ Pro. Credit Companion has been fine-tuned by our Ratings analysts who use it in their own research work, and now Ratings Direct customers will have access to this powerful tool. Credit Companion was designed to enhance credit analysis workflows and power's comparative credit risk analysis between peers. It also provides intelligent summaries and insights from the vast library of published research. We're confident that Credit Companion can improve productivity and efficiency for our customers because we've seen it work for our own analysts already.\nWe're also very excited about the innovation in the digital wealth space with our Indices division. We've recently developed the Spice index builder, which gives professionals access to over 400,000 indices and enables them to create custom indices. While we've enabled customer indices for some time, the launch of an AI-powered index builder can decrease the time to develop equity indices from an average of approximately 1 month down to 2 days.\nLastly, our efforts to upskill and develop our people are showing incredible progress. When we first started talking about Spark Assist, our internally developed AI assistance, we noted that in its first few months, we had seen 14,000 of our people start to use the tool, representing about 30% of our workforce. In the year since then, we've seen that increase to more than 65% of our people globally actively using Spark Assist. Our people continue to build out new use cases and publish those sparks to our internal Spark store, so colleagues around the world can also use them. The number of Sparks on the store has more than doubled since February, with well over 3,000 published Sparks now available to our people. These innovations are enhancing the productivity of our people in meaningful ways. This innovation is all part of a year's long strategy we've had in place to build out this functionality with the ultimate goal of powering agentic ecosystems and really unlocking the potential of the data and technology we have at S&P Global.\nBuilding on the foundation of differentiated data, we've built an embedded powerful AI enablement tools through Kensho, and we now see GenAI enhancements are becoming a standard across our product portfolio. The next evolution is true grounded agentic ecosystems, and we are looking forward to sharing the broader multiyear vision for S&P Global's agenetic AI strategy at our Investor Day in November.\nNow turning to our financial results. Eric will walk through the second quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we've had a great first half of the year. In the second quarter, we had revenue growth in every division and our disciplined execution drove 150 basis points of margin expansion on a trailing 12-month basis. We're encouraged by the results so far and confident that we'll be able to deliver a strong second half as well. Eric, over to you.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Martina, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 13, you'll see on the left panel that despite the challenging operating environment experienced earlier in the quarter, we achieved relatively strong growth across all divisions. Reported and organic constant currency revenue each grew 6% and expenses grew 4%, allowing us to deliver 70 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10%.\nAs Martina mentioned earlier, we're confidently moving forward in our commercial initiatives, and we're continuously innovating our products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. This was evident in our second quarter results and provides us with great momentum as we move into the second half of 2025.\nSlide 14 illustrates the progress we are making in key strategic growth areas. Energy Transition Sustainability revenue grew 7% to $93 million in the quarter, driven by demand for data and insights from Market Intelligence and sustainability products in our Indices division. Growth was partially offset by the softness in demand for our consulting services and Commodity Insights, mainly driven by some of the regulatory uncertainty around energy and energy transition. While this represents a lower growth rate than we're used to in this product family, we remain confident in the long-term growth for noncarbon energy sources, and we expect that this growth to reaccelerate as we get more clarity around the regulatory environment and its impact on the energy mix.\nMoving to private markets. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $148 million. As Martina mentioned, growth was driven by demand for middle market CLOs, ABS and project finance ratings, as well as strength in private market solutions within Market Intelligence. We continue to pursue the many opportunities in private credit and expect the Ratings business to be the leading contributor to private markets revenue growth for the full year as well.\nI'm pleased to report we've achieved 95% of our targeted revenue synergies. We exited the second quarter with run rate revenue synergies of $332 million and remain ahead of pace to achieve our target of $350 million by 2026. Finally, we delivered a Vitality Index at or above our 10% target. In the second quarter, we saw contributions from new and enhanced products in every division and are pleased to see the financial impact of the product investments we've made in recent years.\nTurning to our divisions. Market Intelligence reported revenue increased 5% in the second quarter, but organic constant currency growth was a strong 7%. As Martina mentioned earlier, this is the result of significant improvements to execution and customer engagement in the division, and we're confident we'll be able to achieve the full year guidance we've reiterated today. Data Analytics and Insights reported revenue growth of 6%, with organic revenue growth accelerating to 5% year-over-year. Second quarter revenue in the business line includes a net contribution from Visible Alpha less the lost revenue from the PrimeOne divestiture. Enterprise Solutions benefited from strong demand for our subscription-based offerings, including Wall Street and Notice Manager. Reported revenue growth of 2% includes the impact of $21 million in Concentric revenue in the year ago period. Excluding that impact, organic growth accelerated to 10% year-over-year.\nCredit and Risk Solutions grew 7%, benefiting from demand for Ratings data feeds that are catering to client needs for digitization and automation. Adjusted expenses increased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation and currency translation, but this was partially offset by the impact of the divestitures I mentioned earlier and productivity savings. This resulted in Market Intelligence's operating margin improving by 240 basis points to 35.3%. Finally, we anticipate that reported revenue growth will continue to accelerate in the second half of 2025 as Market Intelligence lapse cancellations from 2024 and the division benefits from the broader revenue transformation.\nNow turning to ratings on Slide 16. While tariff-related concerns brought about considerable volatility in the debt capital markets in early April, as the quarter progressed, we saw an improvement in financing conditions, which led to a resurgence in issuance volumes. Ratings revenue increased 1% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations. However, there was mixed performance among our revenue categories. Transaction revenue decreased by 4% in the second quarter as we saw softer demand relating to bank loan and structured finance ratings. This was partially offset by moderate growth in revenue related to high yield and investment-grade issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 8%, primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue.\nOur expectations for revenue growth in the back half of the year haven't materially changed, but flowing through the second quarter performance drives an increase in our full year financial guidance, and we now expect growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted expenses increased 2%, with investment spending mitigated by decreased performance-related incentives.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 8% following the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Energy Resources Data and Insights, our two largest business lines, price assessments in energy resources data and insights each grew 10%. We continue to see commercial momentum as we transition more customers to enterprise contract relationships. We're approximately 1/3 of the way through the eligible customer base in that transition and expect to be nearly halfway through by year-end. While we expect strong growth in both of these lines in the second half as well, we expect some modest headwinds in price assessments from incremental sanctions that have been introduced in recent weeks, which might cause a 1 to 2 percentage point headwind at most, just in price assessments in the back half.\nAdvisory and Transactional Services revenue grew 5%. Once again, we had a record quarter in Global Trading Services that was fueled by market volatility. However, the complexity of the energy market, regulatory environment and uncertain spending for many of our customers led to a decline in our consulting revenue in the quarter, which mitigated some of that GTS growth. Upstream Data and Insights revenue grew 1% year-over-year as growth was impacted by elevated cancellations due to the customer consolidation we've seen in the energy space. As we discussed last quarter, some softness in Upstream is likely to continue. We expect slight revenue declines in the second half, which could persist into early next year as well. We're actively engaged with clients in accelerating product innovation to stabilize growth in this line going forward.\nGiven the around sanctions and upstream, we are modestly reducing our revenue guidance for Commodity Insights for the full year by 50 basis points. We expect to manage expenses in a way that will allow us to still deliver the margin guidance we've reiterated this morning. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth, offset by productivity initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10% and operating margin improved by 130 basis points to 48.6%.\nNow turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year. The strength of the business model and the essential nature of the Mobility products is increasingly evident, allowing us to raise our full year forecast despite some lingering uncertainty around tariffs and manufacturing. revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in products such as CARFAX and automotiveMastermind. Manufacturing revenue grew 3% year-over-year, impacted by the low recall transactional revenue and sensitivity to tariff-related uncertainty. Financials and other increased 12% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and commercial momentum. Adjusted expenses increased 7% and driven by higher compensation and increased advertising and promotional investment we've called out previously. Margins for the segment improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 42.3%. Finally, as we announced last quarter, we plan to separate the Mobility business from S&P Global. We are on track to meet our key milestones, and we'll keep investors updated on the progress of the separation.\nNow turning to S&P Down Jones Indices. Revenue increased 15%, primarily due to strong growth in fees, which benefited from higher AUM and strength in exchange-traded derivative revenue. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees was up 17% in the second quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM, which benefited from both market appreciation and net inflows.\nExchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 15%, primarily driven by a 12% increase in average daily volumes across our product suite, including SPX and VIX CTD. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in NFA contracts, which saw mid-teens growth for the second consecutive quarter and growth in our custom subscription offerings, partially offset by real-time offerings. Adjusted expenses increased 12% year-over-year due to various factors, including a normalization of bad debt expense, strategic investments and compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 16%, and operating margin improved 60 basis points to 71.3%.\nOur outlook for 2025 assumes U.S. equity markets are flat from June 30 through the end of the year, and we expect modest year-over-year growth in ETDs.\nNow turning to guidance. Slide 20 outlines our Enterprise guidance on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are now expecting total revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, and continue to expect adjusted margins in the range of 48.5% to 49.5%. We remain confident in our ability to deliver solid revenue growth, strong margins and growth in adjusted EPS this year. As I'll discuss on the next slide, we do expect slightly higher growth in Ratings, Indices and Mobility, partially offset by slightly lower growth in Commodity Insights. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $17 to $17.25 in line with the initial guidance we provided back in February and representing 10% growth year-over-year at the high end.\nMoving to our division outlook. Our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence is unchanged as we expect continued strong performance. For Ratings, based on the current expectation for flattish Billed Issuance in the second half, we expect revenue growth of 2% to 5%, which is slightly higher than previous guidance given the outperformance in 2Q. For Indices, we've seen a strong recovery from the April equity market lows and now expect revenue growth back in line with our initial forecast of 8% to 10%.\nFor Mobility, we are slightly raising our outlook for the full year, given the strength of our subscription business. While we do expect some impact on the trade uncertainty in the manufacturing line, which is more than made up by the strength we're seeing in the dealerships and financials. We are lowering outlook slightly for Commodity Insights based on the external factors I described previously.\nOn the next slide, we are reiterating the margin outlook for all five of our divisions. While we do expect somewhat higher revenue in Ratings, Mobility and Indices, we also expect margin impact from the Astra divestiture and planned strategic investments that will drive future growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Eric. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take the first question."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Martina Cheung, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Aboaf, Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.

We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Martina Cheung. Martina?\n\nMartina L. Cheung\n\nPresident-Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. S&P Global had a solid first quarter with strong growth in all 5 of our divisions. Total revenue increased 8% year-over-year, and revenue from our subscription products increased 7%. We continue to demonstrate disciplined execution, driving year-over-year margin expansion of 240 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis and 9% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. We also continued our strong track record of capital allocation, returning over $900 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and repurchases.\nIn addition to our strong financial results, we are acting decisively in our portfolio optimization efforts. As you saw us announce earlier this month, we have signed a definitive agreement to divest the OSTTRA joint venture to KKR, which we expect to close in the second half of this year. As we'll discuss in more detail shortly, we have also announced the intent to separate the Mobility division of S&P Global into a stand-alone public company. We expect this separation to be tax-free and to be completed in 12 to 18 months.\nWe continue to innovate not just in our products themselves, but in how we bring those products to market and how we engage with our customers. We're encouraged by the early indications from our Chief Client office as well as the continued momentum of new products and services introduced in the first quarter. Lastly, we plan to host an Investor Day in November. By November, we expect to have made significant progress on the planned separation of Mobility and we look forward to providing a refreshed view of the multiyear strategy for S&P Global at that time.\nNow turning to what we're seeing in the markets and starting with billed issuance. Billed issuance increased 9% year-over-year in the first quarter. Strength in billed issuance was driven by structured finance and bank loans. While we've continued to see spreads widen year-to-date, they are still below historical norms, and issuers saw an attractive window to issue debt in the first quarter. We expect billed issuance to moderate from Q1 levels for the remainder of 2025, and we have already seen declines in April. We believe some of the strength in Q1, particularly in investment grade was driven by the pull forward of some issuance to get ahead of April. We expect the tariff discussion and related market volatility is likely leading to some pushback of issuance as well, both of which put pressure on issuance volumes in the near term.\nAs we look at the broader macro and commercial conditions, it's clear that we are going through a phase of unpredictable market movements, geopolitical risk and fluidity in the regulatory landscape. It is also clear to us at S&P Global that our customers need us more in times like these, not less. In the first quarter, we saw a significant increase in engagement with our platforms, active users across Capital IQ platforms, Platts Connect and Automotive Masterminds increased on average 23% year-over-year in the first quarter, and we have continued to see strong engagement through April. Our customers are looking for insights, data and tools to help them navigate. And S&P Global is a destination of choice for decision makers around the world. We also saw record attendance at two of our marquee conferences in the first quarter. CERAWeek widely considers the world's preeminent energy conference had over 10,000 attendees, including government officials and 1,600 C-Suite executives and Board Directors. For over 40 years, the energy industry has weathered at CERAWeek to confront some of the biggest challenges facing the world. This year was particularly impactful as we saw business leaders and government officials take advantage of our platform to make major product strategy and policy announcements from the CERAWeek stage.\nWe also had record attendance at our Premier Shipping and Logistics Conference, TPM 25. More than ever, customers need insight into how to effectively manage logistics and supply chains. And it was encouraging to see so many industry leaders gather under the S&P Global banner to share ideas and insights on navigating the current environment.\nWe know it's not enough to wait for our customers to come to us. So we have continued our proactive outreach to customers through our global commercial teams in conjunction with the Chief Client office. Like many of the individuals on this call, our customers are facing variables that are increasingly difficult to predict week to week. We are seeing a slowing pace of decision-making in the markets compared to our initial expectations. While we and many others expected some improvement in the M&A environment, many of our customers are less confident in both the timing and the magnitude of that recovery this year. We consistently hear about the pent-up demand, and we maintain strong optimism in the long term, but many customers are trying to stay flexible and preserve optionality in the very near term.\nWe benefit, however, from the resilience of our business mix. with recurring revenue accounting for approximately 75% of our total revenue, we aren't overly reliant on market-driven factors for our results in any given year. Market volatility can also benefit areas of our business, as you can see in the results of our ETD business and Indices and the Global Trading Services business and Commodity Insights. These derivative products built on the IP of S&P Global's Index and Commodity divisions, are crucial to procurement, hedging and other strategies that see heightened demand in periods of volatility. Many of our products are mission-critical for our customers with annual and multiyear contracts, providing additional stability for our business through the cycle.\nEven within our Ratings business, nearly half of our revenue comes from nontransaction revenue, which is more stable, predictable and consistent in its growth during volatile periods. Despite the near-term headwinds facing issuance, we expect continued growth in our non-transaction business in 2025. That said, there are a number of market factors that can have incremental impact on our business in the near term, and it's important to pay close attention to how these factors are evolving over the year. Even with a very strong portfolio of market-leading products and services, we acknowledge the broad market factors like trade conflicts and supply chain risk as well as the evolving geopolitical landscape. These things make it more challenging to foresee or plan for central bank actions or the level of capital markets activity that may take place in 2025.\nAs we look to the global markets, we continue to see secular trends that will benefit S&P Global, like the continued shift from active to passive management and energy transition. For 2025 specifically, we expect asset prices in the equity market as well as the mix of investment grade versus high yield in the near-term maturity walls see modest headwinds relative to our initial outlook. However, we continue to see other factors like the timing of issuance, market volatility and the fluidity of regulatory actions as having positive impacts on part of our business and modestly negative impacts on others. The base case assumptions underpinning our outlook for 2025 reflect the changes we've seen in the environment since February. We originally assumed 3% global GDP growth and 2.3% U.S. inflation. Our current view is that GDP growth will be lower than that forecast, though we do not assume a recession. We also expect inflation to be a bit higher than originally assumed in our guidance. We expect crude oil prices to average in the low 70s for the year, slightly above the levels we're seeing now, though we do expect volatility in the coming quarters.\nWe've had a strong start to the year for billed issuance. But since the end of Q1, we have seen market volatility suppressing volumes, particularly in high yields, and we expect second quarter issuance to decline double digits year-over-year before returning to more or less flat growth in the second half. As such, we now expect billed issuance to be approximately flat year-over-year compared to our initial outlook of low single-digit growth.\nMaturity walls for the remainder of 2025 and 2026 are still 3% to 5% higher than corresponding walls were a year ago, but our billed issuance assumptions now call for M&A volumes to be flat year-over-year compared to prior assumptions of modest improvements from 2024. We still see potential for one or more rate cuts from the U.S. Fed in 2025.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, there is a range of potential outcomes beyond our base case assumptions, but we continue to reflect our current thinking and plan to update and refine as we move through the year. All these things are factored into the guidance as Eric will share with you in a moment.\nOne of the reasons S&P Global is able to deliver strong financial results through the cycle is our commitment to continued innovation and customer value. The first quarter included some important innovations in data, benchmarks and artificial intelligence. We integrated visible alpha data as an add-on module in Capital IQ Pro, and we were thrilled that the team was able to get this important integration completed and ready for customers a full quarter ahead of schedule. We are also very excited to discuss the launch of eye-level automated data ingestion. This joint innovation between our Market Intelligence and Kensho teams created an AI-powered tool that can pull in data from structured and unstructured sources, tag that data appropriately and load it eye-level. This makes it faster and easier for customers to manage increasingly complex portfolios across private equity and private credit. Just as importantly, this tool was developed in a way that lets us leverage its capabilities in other products and even in our own internal workflows like our CRM. It's a great example of our cross-divisional teams, creating scalable technology that's built once and deployed everywhere.\nWe also introduced important benchmarks in our fixed income and franchise, including a first-of-its-kind fixed income index in Europe utilizing rolling fixed maturity credits. In Platts, we introduced new commodity benchmarks in biofuels, fertilizers, chemicals and metals. We encourage you to look through the quarterly release notes to see the continued rapid pace of new products and content in Commodity Insights.\nTurning to our financial results. Eric will walk through the first quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we have had an impressive start to 2025. We saw strong growth in every division and 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Trailing 12-month margins improved 240 basis points to a record 49.3%.\nNow turning to the big announcement we made this morning. We're excited to announce today our intent to spin S&P Global's Mobility division into a stand-alone public company. We believe this separation will maximize shareholder value by enhancing S&P Global's strategic focus while creating a scaled and independent mobility business. This decision is a result of a lengthy and very robust internal analysis, and the Board and management team are unanimously aligned that this is the right course of action to create value for our shareholders.\nLooking at the financials of both S&P Global's core businesses, and S&D Global Mobility, we see that both have very attractive profiles. S&P Global's four core businesses, Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights and S&P Dow Jones Indices, generated nearly $13 billion in revenue in 2024 at an adjusted operating margin of approximately 50%. Mobility generated $1.6 billion at an adjusted operating margin of nearly 40%. Both businesses have a history of innovation, growth, discipline and strong competitive positioning, and we expect that to continue following the separation. We believe the separation will create some significant advantages for S&P Global going forward. Our four core divisions have similar characteristics, similar customer profiles, and greater ability to share technological and data resources across them. Our leadership team will be better able to focus attention, energy and resources to accelerate product development and deepen customer relationships while executing against a more unified and cohesive strategy. We're excited to share more about that multiyear strategy at our Investor Day, which we plan to host in New York on November 13.\nAs a stand-alone public company, we believe the Mobility business will also be better able to execute its long-term growth strategy independent of the priorities of S&P Global. Mobility will be a well-capitalized company, with strong, well-known brands like credit CARFAX, Automotive Mastermind, MarketScan and As our analysts and shareholders know, Mobility has incredible data and technology assets, creating significant customer value for dealerships, automotive OEMs and parts suppliers as well as finance and insurance companies. We've seen significant growth in the users of CARFAX Car Care, now serving over 46 million consumers leveraging more than 35 billion vehicle history records. The vehicle history, forecasting, pricing and incentive data of the mobility business serve 100% of the top automotive OEMs, 94% of the supplier market and includes approximately 72 million lines of monthly forecast. This data and technology is deeply entrenched in the workflows of Mobility customers creating a very strong competitive moat and positioning the business well for profitable long-term growth.\nWe are particularly encouraged by the resilience this business has demonstrated through the cycle. We acknowledge the additional attention to the automotive space during these times of trade conflict and supply chain disruption, but we remain very confident in the long-term growth of the Mobility business. The secular trends around EV transition, autonomous and software-defined vehicles, shifts in the sales motion of new vehicles and continued growth in the used car markets all have the potential to increase the demand and addressable market of this business. With more than 70% of mobility revenue tied to the used car market and more than 80% of revenue coming from subscription products, we remain confident that despite some of the end market challenges among automotive manufacturers, the Mobility business is largely insulated from direct impact.\nWe expect both companies to be well capitalized and we will provide the details around capital structure and capital allocation as the transaction progresses. We expect the transaction to qualify as tax-free to shareholders for U.S. federal tax purposes. We anticipate the process taking between 12 and 18 months and will be subject to market conditions and the satisfaction of customary regulatory approvals. We are committed to keeping investors up-to-date as we move through this process, and investors can expect a number of milestones over the next 12 to 18 months.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Eric Aboaf, our new CFO, to review the financial results. Eric, welcome to the call. Over to you.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Martina, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be joining for my very first earnings call here at S&P Global and especially pleased to be able to talk through such strong results this quarter.\nStarting with Slide 18, you'll see on the left panel that we delivered a very strong start to 2025 with solid growth in every division and 9% organic constant currency revenue growth for the company. Revenue growth of 8% and expense growth of 6% allowed us to deliver 100 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and 9% in adjusted diluted EPS growth. As Martina mentioned earlier, we continue to engage proactively with customers across the board this quarter while maintaining strict discipline on expenses. That focus and execution helped us to deliver a strong first quarter and also positions us well to deliver strong results for the rest of 2025.\nSlide 19 illustrates the progress we continue to make in key strategic growth areas. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 20% to $93 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights energy transition products and data and insights from Market Intelligence. We continue to see very strong demand for our sustainability offerings in all divisions and saw a number of competitive wins in the quarter, especially around our physical risk solutions.\nMoving to private markets. Revenue increased by 21% year-over-year to $140 million. Growth was driven by debt and bank loan ratings as well as continued strength in eye-level and other private market solutions within Market Intelligence. Private credit continues to be a significant driver of growth for us, and we continue to see strong demand for an S&P Global Rating on debt, whether it is issued in the public or the private markets.\nWe are also nearing the finish line on our revenue synergies. We exited the first quarter with run rate revenue synergies of $311 million and remain ahead of pace to achieve our target of $350 million by 2026. Finally, we are pleased that we continue to deliver a Vitality Index at or above our 10% target. In the first quarter, we saw contributions from new and enhanced products in every division and are pleased to see the financial impact of the product investments we've made in recent years.\nTurning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 5% in the first quarter with the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, creating a roughly 30 basis point headwind to growth. Revenue from our Data Analytics and Insights products accelerated on both the reported and an organic basis in the first quarter to 7% and 4% year-over-year, respectively. First quarter revenue in the business line includes the net contribution from Visible Alpha less the lost revenue from the PrimeOne divestiture. Enterprise Solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the debt and equity capital markets as well as strong growth in subscription products. Reported revenue growth of 1% includes the impact of $21 million in Fincentric revenue in the year ago period. Excluding that impact, organic growth was 8% year-over-year.\nCredit and Risk Solutions grew 6%, supported by strong new sales and price realization, particularly for Ratings Express subscriptions. Consistent with the commentary we made during our last call, margins were below the full year guidance range in the first quarter, but actually came in slightly better than we initially expected based on some tight expense controls we put in place at the start of the year. Margins of 32.8% improved slightly year-over-year. We expect some modest improvement in the quarterly revenue growth rates in 2025 as we progress through the year. We see strong growth in the sales pipeline and stable renewal rates and we expect both of those dynamics to continue as we lap more of the cancellations from 2024. We're also encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing in our competitive win rates and Market Intelligence as our enterprise approach continues to resonate with more and more customers.\nNow turning to Ratings on Slide 21. As Martina mentioned earlier, we saw issuers take advantage of favorable financing conditions and open market windows to drive growth in issuance volumes in the first quarter. Q1 was actually the fifth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue for our Ratings division. Ratings revenue increased 8% year-over-year as we saw positive growth across all revenue categories. Transaction revenue grew by 7% in the first quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and structured finance fees. Nontransaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and elevated issuer credit rating or ICR revenue. Importantly, much of our growth in ICR came from private market mandates as more and more participants in the private markets are looking to capture the value that comes from an S&P Global rating. Given the pullback we've seen in April issuance volumes, we do expect billed issuance to be down low double digits in the second quarter and flattish in the second half. This will primarily impact the cadence of transaction revenue while nontransaction revenue continues to grow at a healthy pace each quarter. As Martina mentioned earlier, we benefit from the strong base of non-transaction revenue in our Ratings business and we expect nontransaction revenue to grow faster than transaction revenue in a year like 2025. That provides some additional stability to our Ratings business through the cycle.\nAdjusted expenses increased only 4% in the quarter. We continue to actively monitor the issuance environment and manage expense levers in our market-driven businesses tightly to preserve margins and ensure we're positioned to deliver against the profitability targets we set out for 2025.\nNow turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 9% following the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in energy and resource data and insights. Price assessments and data and insights grew 8% and 10%, respectively. We continue to see commercial momentum as we transition more customers to enterprise contract relationships. We are approximately 1 quarter of the way through the eligible customer base in that transition and expect to be nearly halfway through by year-end. Advisory and transactional services revenue grew 19%. As Martina noted earlier, times of volatility and uncertainty drive increased demand for a number of our products, and we saw this positive impact in the first quarter. We had a record quarter in Global Trading Services and record attendance at CERAWeek, both of which contributed to the outsized growth we saw here too.\nUpstream Data and Insights revenue grew by 1% year-over-year, with growth tempered by somewhat elevated cancellations due to the customer consolidation we've seen in the energy space. We expect that consolidation to impact upstream a bit more in the remaining quarters of 2025. Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 11% and operating margin improved by 90 basis points to 48.1%.\nNow turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, but this includes a roughly 70 basis point headwind from currency impacts, largely due to exposure to the Canadian dollar. Dealer revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in products such as CARFAX and Automotive Mastermind. Dealer revenue benefits from its higher exposure to the used car market, which is generally more resilient for this cycle than the new car market. Manufacturing increased 1%, with growth impacted by the decline in the transaction revenue related to the recall business. As a reminder, we began calling out the impact of the decline in recalls earlier last year and will lap that impact beginning in the second quarter.\nFinancials and other increased 11% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and commercial momentum. Adjusted expenses increased 8% due primarily to the increased advertising and promotional investment. That investment has helped drive significant growth in CARFAX Car Care, which now has approximately 46 million users, a nearly 65% increase since our Investor Day in 2022. Margins for the segment improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 38.5%.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 15%, primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and continued strength in exchange-traded derivative revenue. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees was up a strong 18% in the first quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM, benefiting from both market appreciation and net inflows. As a reminder, there is a slight delay in revenue recognition in our asset-linked fees, which allows us to continue benefiting from higher equity valuations we saw during the fourth quarter of last year. We do expect growth in asset-linked fees to moderate in Q2 and beyond given the declines we've seen in market valuations since we gave our initial guidance.\nExchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 11%, primarily driven by the strong volumes in SPX products and price realization. Data and custom subscriptions increased 7% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts, which saw mid-teens growth in the quarter. Revenue from custom subscriptions, however, somewhat offset the very strong growth in contracts. Adjusted expenses increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased investments in strategic growth initiatives as well as an increase in compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15% and operating margin remained unchanged year-over-year at a very strong 72.9%.\nNow turning to guidance. Given our new debt issuance expectations, and the current equity market levels. Slide 25 outlines our enterprise guidance on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are now expecting total revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%, with adjusted margins in the range of 48.5% to 49.5%. We remain confident in our ability to deliver solid revenue growth, strong margins and growth in adjusted EPS this year. As I'll discuss on the next slide, we do expect slightly lower growth in Ratings and Indices, our two market-driven and highest margin businesses, but we plan to manage expenses so that we can preserve margin guidance in all 5 divisions this year. However, due to the planned closing of the OSTTRA sale later this year, we will see slightly lower operating income with no corresponding revenue impact, which will directly impact margins for the year. The OSTTRA impact and the mix shift in revenue are the primary drivers for the change to our enterprise margin guidance.\nWe expect to use the proceeds from OSTTRA for additional share repurchases, which will offset much of the EPS impact, and our discipline on both expenses and strong capital returns allows us to keep the high end of our EPS guidance intact. Given the market volatility and variability in our market-driven businesses, we think it's prudent to widen the range a bit and now expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $16.75 to $17.25.\nMoving to our division outlook. Our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence is unchanged. For ratings, based on the current expectation for flattish billed issuance this year, we expect revenue growth to be flat to up 4%, slightly lower, but also a slightly broader range compared to our previous guidance. Revenue guidance for Commodity Insights and Mobility are also unchanged. For indices, we've obviously seen the market pullback, particularly in U.S. equities since we gave our initial guidance. Given that pullback, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. This guidance assumes the S&P 500 is flat from April 15 through the end of the year. Modest growth in ETD volumes and subscription growth similar to what we saw in the first quarter.\nOn the next slide, we are reiterating the margin outlook for all 5 of our divisions. While we do expect somewhat lower revenue in Ratings and Indices, we expect to offset that impact with expense discipline and modest adjustments to incentive compensation. We have multiple levers that we can pull as needed this year, and we've proactively identified and prioritized those. We want to make sure we are prudent and don't pull them too early or too aggressively though, and preserve our ability to invest in the important revenue growth opportunities we see over the next few years.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Martina Cheung, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Craig, Interim Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Martina Cheung. Martina?\n\nMartina L. Cheung\n\nPresident-Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. By any measure, 2024, it was an incredible year for S&P Global. Excluding Engineering Solutions, which was divested in 2023, revenue increased 15%, and revenue from our subscription products increased 7%. We benefited from strong market trends, including record debt issuance for our Ratings business and strong equity valuations for our index business.\nHowever, we also continue to demonstrate the discipline and operational excellence our shareholders have come to expect from us delivering accelerated revenue growth in commodity insights and strong steady growth in both market intelligence and mobility despite some market headwinds on those 2 businesses.\nWe continue to take a balanced approach to profitability and investment, which allowed us to make important investments in technology, AI and products while still expanding margins more than 300 basis points. We delivered 25% growth in adjusted EPS in 2024. This exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range by more than 13%.\nOur disciplined approach to capital allocation allowed us to return $4.4 billion to shareholders over the course of 2024 through our cash dividend and the repurchase of 6.7 million shares. We expect to continue strong capital returns in 2025 as we recently announced the 52nd consecutive increase to our cash dividend and a newly approved share repurchase authorization up to $4.3 billion. In total, you'll see this would allow us to maintain our target of returning 85% or more of the $6 billion in adjusted free cash flow we are expecting in 2025.\nI've been very impressed with our people's ability to execute and deliver such strong results, embracing the leadership transition and the increased focus on our customers and our enterprise advantages. With that increased focus on serving our clients at the enterprise level, we announced the establishment of the Chief Client Office and the Enterprise Data office. We're excited to share the successes from these initiatives with you as we progress through the year.\nWe're also pleased to share that our new Chief Financial Officer, Eric Aboaf, will be joining us officially on February 19.\nWe are gaining momentum in our product innovation and AI initiatives across the organization as well as I'll share with you in a moment. Lastly, we continue the cycle of optimizing our portfolio of businesses so that we are best positioned for long-term profitable growth. In 2024, we acquired best-in-class solutions to support strategic growth through Visible Alpha, ProntoNLP and World Hydrogen Leaders. We also divested noncore businesses in Centriq and Prime One.\nOne of my first priorities as CEO was to strengthen and deepen our relationship with key strategic customers at the highest levels of leadership. I had more than 100 meetings with some of our most important stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition of these key relationships. These important discussions include not just our customers but also strategic commercial and technology partners. Together with our new Chief Client Officer, I met 85% of our largest strategic customers just in the last 100 days. We are instilling in our executive leadership team, a clear need to be where our customers are. Our success depends on the value we create and deliver for our customers. So I've asked our division leadership to make these relationships a personal priority for them as well. This emphasis on customer engagement is a natural evolution for S&P Global. We've always made customer value of focus. But by making customer engagement a higher priority at the executive level, we are building stronger relationships so that we can accelerate our response to customers' challenges. This engagement can also serve as opportunities to partner or co-invest with our customers.\nOne such example is the UBS Leveraged Loan Index partnership. Through these many meetings, I'm picking up a consistent set of themes which align very well with our competitive advantages and reinvigorate our optimism and confidence in our ability to compete and win.\nWhile generative AI is not a new topic for our customers, they're moving beyond just considering what this technology can do and focusing on use cases that can scale quickly and contribute to strong financial results. Customers increasingly turn to us to benefit from our years of experience scaling AI technology from Kensho. We continue to see impactful headlines and market news on a near daily basis.\nCustomers are deeply engaged to determine the potential impact to their business and tariffs, regional competitiveness and other aspects of global trade. S&P Global is a world-class provider of data insights and thought leadership in these vital areas, and our customers are turning to us for that expertise. Customers continue to feel the impact of the innovation taking place in financial markets with the flow of capital to passive funds, but also increasingly to private markets and digital assets. Through our leadership in benchmarks, private credit, private equity workflow tools and innovation like our stable coin assessments, our customers see us as a critical partner in navigating this sea change over the coming years.\nAdditionally, customers recognize our leadership and seek our insights and energy transition. Energy transition is a complex issue encompassing energy security, technology innovation and the financing of the various investments needed over the coming decades. For example, in utilities, the depth and breadth of our expertise and data sets across oil, liquid natural gas, carbon, renewable energy, electric utilities and reporting all helped drive the 23% growth in revenue from our energy transition and sustainability products in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look to 2025, we are hearing general expectations for some improvements in the macroeconomic environment. There is some variability by geographic region here with caution and uncertainty around Europe and Asia, providing some ballast against the general optimism we're seeing in the U.S. markets. We are seeing strong demand for our products and some modest tailwinds from vendor consolidation. We continue to see the benefits from the breadth of our offerings as our enterprise approach allows us to meet more of our customers' needs in a more cost-effective way. As we've discussed for some time now, we continue to see conditions in the financial services end market below what we would consider normal, though we do expect a gradual improvement over the course of the year. We are also experiencing a highly competitive environment in financial services and somewhat elevated price sensitivity, most notably impacting Market Intelligence.\nNow turning to the 2024 issuance environment. We saw nearly $4 trillion in billed issuance in 2024, significantly outpacing our expectations. With extremely favorable market conditions, including tight credit spreads and lowering interest rates, we saw many issuers take advantage in 2024 to refinance debt and felt very strong activity in CLO volumes as well as repricing and amend and extend activity. While this does create a very difficult compare for 2025, we believe the refinancing walls and a recovering M&A environment will contribute to modest growth in build issuance this year, as we'll discuss in more detail in a moment.\nAs we look next to the Vitality Index, I'm encouraged that this index continues to accomplish its intended purpose. When we introduced this metric at our Investor Day in 2022, we discussed the importance of making sure we were prioritizing new products that can contribute to our financial performance over time. We also noted that new products would remain in the Vitality Index for a finite time and would eventually mature out. The focus is to make sure that revenue from maturing products is replaced by new and enhanced products that can scale quickly. At the beginning of 2024, we had a number of meaningful products mature out of the Vitality Index. Those products contributed a combined $330 million to the index in 2023, nearly 25% of the total index. By continuing to innovate and invest in products, we were able to more than replace that mature revenue and end the year with an index of $1.5 billion, representing nearly 11% of total revenue. At the end of 2024, we had another group of products mature out of the Vitality Index, and we are confident that our focus on customer value and rapid innovation will once again enable us to deliver a Vitality Index at or above 10% this year.\nTurning to just a few examples of that innovation. As the world's leading provider of benchmarks, we continue to invest and innovate to launch new benchmark products and make our existing benchmarks better. In 2024, we expanded the collection of multi-asset class indices offered through S&P Dow Jones Indices and we launched the leveraged loan indices in partnership with UBS. We continue to introduce new Platts price assessments every year and 2024 saw the launch of new assessments for various chemicals, beef and poultry. We also introduced a first-of-its-kind product in the digital asset space to assess stable coins.\nWe know that data and technology lay at the heart of almost everything we do, so we continue to make meaningful investments in our internal technology and our technology products. We are finding new ways to leverage the remarkable data estate that we have, and just one example of that in 2024 was the introduction of the market fixed income securities data in Capital IQ Pro.\nPart of our focus on technology must include a strategy to leverage the incredible technological advancement taking place in the world today, such as generative AI. First, beginning with our people. We are continuing to build a culture that embraces AI, and we are empowering our people with the tools, training and resources they need to thrive. In 2024, we introduced our internally developed Copilot called S&P Spark Assist. Since introducing Spark assist, we have seen over 1,300 different use cases developed and shared internally across what we call our Spark Store.\nAs we focus on developing AI skills across our entire workforce, we are seeing our people truly embrace the use of these powerful tools to automate workflows, more quickly ingest new information and more efficiently generate their own work products. We firmly believe that as we embrace the use of AI internally, it will unlock significant potential for product innovation as well.\nJust as we learned with Kensho's incredible innovations over the years, tools and resources that improve our productivity and efficiency will likely benefit our customers as well.\nThrough ongoing customer meetings, we hear again and again, they want to be able to access and integrate S&P Global's data into their AI workloads. In order to expand and facilitate how and where customers can connect to our data, we launched a new solution, Kensho-LLM-ready API that enables users to seamlessly integrate complex, high-priority S&P Global data sets into generative AI models for their own internal use. It integrates with large language models like GPT, Gemini or Claude, allowing customers to use natural language to query our tabular data sets. This is all part of our ongoing effort to bring our data into this new era of Gen AI and ensure that we are meeting customers where they are and where they are going in their AI journeys.\nWe also embedded generative AI functionality in our major desktop applications, including ChatAI for Platts Connect as well as ChatIQ and Document Intelligence for Capital IQ Pro, all with the same vision of empowering our customers to more quickly and effectively gain insights from our data with AI.\nWe also identified and acquired market-leading solutions that we believe strengthen our competitive position in multiple areas, while contributing to the immediate financial results of the company. These include Visible Alpha and ProntoNLP in our Market Intelligence division and World Hydrogen Leaders in our Commodity Insights division. With the ultimate goal of driving profitable long-term revenue growth, we will continue to lean into these kinds of innovation: development of tools for our own efficiency and productivity, organic development of new products for our customers, partnerships to develop new products and token acquisitions to accelerate the pace of scale and leadership.\nYou'll notice that across these examples of innovation runs a common thread of generative AI. When we look at the potential for generative AI across the business over the next several years, there are seemingly endless opportunities to innovate and add value for our customers. And with all this possibility, we will ensure that S&P Global remains an indispensable partner to our customers as they adopt AI into more and more of their workloads.\nWe're doing this in many ways,; including building sophisticated gen AI experiences, laying the groundwork for agentive workflows and investing in foundational AI capabilities that help our customers more quickly and effectively gain insights from our data. In the coming quarters and years, you'll see us lean more into practical applications that have the potential to move the needle on financial performance and enhance the value of our products. We will prioritize those use cases that improve our revenue growth potential, improve our operational productivity and efficiency, improve the capabilities and skills of our people. and safeguard the security around our proprietary data and our systems. This will require us to say no to a lot of things, but will allow us to effectively put investment dollars to work in ways that have the greatest potential to create real value. You've seen us do that in recent years with Spark Assist, ChatIQ and many of the important innovations from our Kensho team, and we will continue to highlight our progress in this important area going forward.\nNow turning to our financial results. Chris will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we are pleased and encouraged by the results we delivered for our shareholders in 2024.\nWe continue to see strong growth in our market-driven and our subscription businesses, with total revenue increasing 14%, or 15% excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions. We also delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. As Chris will discuss in a moment, we saw some elevated expenses in 2024 related to incentive compensation and commissions due to the very strong revenue beat this year. Were it not for that increase in compensation expense, we would have had year-over-year margin expansion in every division.\nNow I'll turn to Chris to review the financial results.\n\nChristopher Craig\n\nInterim CFO, Senior VP, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nWe finished 2024 with strong results as fourth quarter revenue grew by 14% compared to the prior year, with growth across all of our divisions. .\nNotably, our market-driven businesses, Ratings and Indices each grew by over 20% in the quarter as we capitalized on favorable conditions in both the debt and equity markets. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% year-over-year to $3.77. This is driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 260 basis points and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count.\nNow turning to strategic investment areas, where I'm excited to share that there was positive momentum across our key initiatives, all of which are helping drive sustainable growth for the company. Energy transition and sustainability revenue grew 23% to $104 million in the fourth quarter. Growth was driven primarily by strong performance in Commodity Insights energy transition offerings and positive fund flows and sustainability-focused indices.\nIn Private Markets Solutions, revenue growth accelerated to 29% to $146 million in the fourth quarter. Growth was driven primarily by continued strong demand for our private market ratings and assessments within S&P Global Ratings. For revenue synergies, we exited the fourth quarter with an annualized run rate of $284 million, representing 81% of the target synergies we expected to achieve in 2026. During the quarter, we realized $74 million in revenue synergies. We are pleased to see both cross-sell and new product revenue synergies coming in above our expectations in Q4.\nFinally, we generated approximately $409 million in Vitality revenue during the fourth quarter, resulting in an 11% Vitality Index. As previously highlighted, we anticipate a steady stream of innovative offerings to replace any products graduating from the index, ensuring sustained momentum in our product lineup.\nNow turning to expenses, we saw a total increase of 9% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily driven by ongoing investments in our core business and growth initiatives, coupled with increased incentives, commissions and compensation. The significant outperformance in our Ratings and Indices divisions during the fourth quarter increased incentive compensation across the enterprise.\nTurning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter or 6% excluding acquisitions and divestitures, with positive revenue growth in every business line. We continue to see the effect of cancellations early in 2024 impacting revenue growth in the fourth quarter. However, the fourth quarter is the largest renewal quarter of the year in MI, and we are pleased to see retention rates improve to the highest rates we've seen since 2023. We also had significant competitive wins in each of the business lines in Market Intelligence and no significant competitive losses.\nLastly, we had a very strong quarter of net new sales for Capital IQ Pro. Importantly, annualized contract value, or ACV, growth outpaced revenue growth soundly in the fourth quarter. This should position Market Intelligence to see gradually improving revenue growth rates as we progress through 2025. Desktop grew 8%, though growth would have been less than 1% excluding Visible Alpha. Data & Advisory Solutions grew 4%, or 5% when excluding the impact of the Prime One divestiture, driven by strong demand for pricing and reference data, especially in the loan in CDS asset classes and industry and company data. Enterprise Solutions grew 6%, or 16% when excluding the impact of the Fincentriq divestiture. Growth was driven by strong demand for our lending solution offerings, including ClearPar and Notice Manager and renewals for our enterprise data management software.\nCredit and Risk Solutions grew 2% despite lapping a significant retroactive revenue benefit from a renewed and extended customer contract in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding this onetime item, the growth in the business line would have accelerated to 7%, primarily driven by strong renewals and net new sales. Adjusted expenses increased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in compensation and cloud costs. Operating profit growth was positive in the quarter, while operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 32.6%. Full year margin contracted 50 basis points to 32.5%. As Martin mentioned, incentive compensation was elevated due to the company's overall performance in 2024. Were it not for this impact, full year margins in Market Intelligence would have expanded year-over-year.\nAs we noted in the slides, beginning with the first quarter of 2025, we will be reporting Market Intelligence results in 3 business lines. Enterprise Solutions and Credit and Risk Solutions will be unchanged, but we will be combining Desktop with Data & Advisory solutions in a single reporting line called Data, Analytics and Insights. This should make our results more easily comparable to others in the space.\nNow turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter, we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as spreads narrowed to historically low levels and the continued strength in CLO volumes. As a result, Ratings revenue increased 27%, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 54% in the fourth quarter, fueled by market conditions highlighted earlier that spurred robust demand for bond and bank loan ratings. This growth was further amplified by heightened activity in what is usually a seasonally low issuance period during the holiday season.\nNontransaction revenue increased 8%, driven by an increase in annual and program fees and an increase in new rating mandates. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily due to increased incentive compensation. This resulted in a 42% increase in operating profit and a 630 basis point increase in operating margin to 59.7%. For the full year, Ratings margin expanded 650 basis points to 63%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in Energy & Resources Data & Insights and Advisory & Transactional services. Price Assessments and Energy and Resources data and Insights grew 9% and 10%, respectively. Growth was driven by strength in our traditional offerings, such as our crude and refined product suite. In addition, both business lines continue to benefit from favorable commercial conditions. Advisory and transactional services revenue grew by 27%, or 18% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition. This is primarily driven by continued strong demand for Energy and Transition products and services as well as strong trading volumes across all commodity sectors in Global Trading Services.\nUpstream Data and Insights revenue increased by 3%, driven by growth in our Research Insights Offerings and strong demand for subscription-based software and analytics products. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 11% and operating margin expanded by 60 basis points to 45%. Full year margin increased by 70 basis points to 46.8%.\nAnd now turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 9% in the fourth quarter, driven by demand for the CARFAX product suite and strong performance from our insurance-related products. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth at CARFAX and Automotive Mastermind offerings. Manufacturing revenue increased 1% as the business line continued to see lower transaction revenue related to our recall business, offsetting strong growth in our subscription-based offerings. The headwinds facing our recall business began in early 2024, and we expect to fully lap that headwind by the second quarter of 2025.\nGrowth in financials and other accelerated to 18% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and market share growth. Adjusted expenses increased 7%. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 12% for the quarter and operating margin expanding by 100 basis points to 34.7%. Full year margin increased by 20 basis points to 39%.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 21%, primarily driven by growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM as well as growth in Data & Custom subscriptions. Asset-linked fees were up 31%, driven by market appreciation and inflows. In the fourth quarter, we recorded net inflows of $486 billion, which, along with market appreciation, total ETF AUM to approximately $4.4 trillion. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by an increase in realized revenue per contract, partially offset by slightly lower contract volumes. Data & custom subscriptions increased 5% year-over-year as we continue to implement commercial initiatives across the various product offerings within the business line. However, growth in the fourth quarter was partially offset by a retrospective revenue adjustment. Excluding the impact of this onetime headwind, data and customer subscriptions would have grown by 10%.\nAdjusted expenses increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased incentive compensation, combined with continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives. Indices operating profit increased 24% and operating margin expanded by 180 basis points to 67.9%. For the full year, Indices operating margin expanded by 140 basis points to 70.3%.\n2024 was a tremendous year, and our financial results reflect that. As we look to 2025 and beyond, the innovation and investment that we made in 2024 position us very well to continue delivering long-term profitable growth and create meaningful value for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand it back to Martina to walk through the outlook and the guidance.\n\nMartina L. Cheung\n\nPresident-Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Our financial guidance for 2025 assumes global GDP growth of 3%, U.S. inflation of 2.3% and an average price for Brent crude of $72 per barrel. These all represent some degree of mean reversion from the figures we've seen over the last couple of years, which we think should contribute to a stable issuance environment and a gradually improving backdrop for our financial services customers as we progress through 2025.\nWe acknowledge, however, the degree of macro and geopolitical uncertainty that exists right now and that there is a range of potential outcomes beyond our base case assumptions. Our base case assumption is that we see at least 1 more rate cut this year in the U.S. We recognize that market expectations around the pace of 2025 breakups have moderated over the last several months. But as we've seen in recent years, these rate movements are difficult to predict with a high degree of confidence.\nAs such, we are taking a prudent approach to our forecast for billed issuance. We expect low single-digit growth in billed issuance in 2025 from a record high base in 2024.\nTurning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that next 12-month maturities, meaning 2025 maturities now compared to 2024 maturities measured at this time last year, are approximately 4% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturities expected over the next 3 years, however, are approximately 1% lower than they were 12 months ago. Our billed issuance forecast takes both of these rates into accounts. The maturity walls make up just one of the factors we consider when providing an outlook on billed issuance.\nGiven the record issuance here we've had and the deceleration we are expecting in 2025, we wanted to provide some additional context around our outlook for low single-digit growth in billed issuance. Importantly, we saw an acceleration in the pull forward of the 2025 maturity wall during the fourth quarter, which impacts our outlook in 2 ways. First, it drove stronger issuance than we expected during the fourth quarter of 2024. We saw that in our financial results, and it creates a more difficult compare this year. Second, it obviously decreases the amount of near-term maturities that are available to get refinanced in 2025. We continue to expect favorable market conditions around stable rates and credit spreads, and we are encouraged by the robust maturity walls over the next few years, all of which inspires confidence that issuance will see positive growth in 2025.\nOur outlook for the Ratings division assumes the refinancing of 2025 maturities and modest pull forward from the 2026 and later maturities. We also expect some improvement in the M&A environment relative to the last couple of years and there should be some tailwinds to issuance as a result. Lastly, our expectation is that the mix of issuance is likely to shift slightly in favor of investment grade compared to what we saw in 2024.\nAgainst that backdrop, we are introducing our financial guidance for 2025. This slide illustrates our guidance for GAAP results.\nMoving to our adjusted guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% in 2025. We expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 49% to 50%, which represents up to 100 basis points of margin expansion beyond the high profitability level reported in 2024. Through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, disciplined execution and strong capital returns, we expect to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $17 to $17.25, representing double-digit growth at the high end.\nTurning to our outlook by division. In Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6.5%. We exited 2024 with a very strong renewal quarter with the highest retention rate we've seen in the last 6 quarters. That sets up the subscription business for improving growth, but we would still be lapping the elevated cancellations from the prior quarters. As a result, we expect the growth rate to be the lowest in the first quarter and improve as we progress through the year. Due to the timing of revenue recognition, the lapping of acquisitions and divestitures and the phasing of investments, we also expect margins to be the lowest in the first quarter. However, we expect to take a very disciplined approach to expense management in Market Intelligence this year and expect to deliver margins in the range of 33% to 34%, representing 50 to 150 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year.\nFor Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% as billed issuance growth and modest price increases are somewhat offset by expected unfavorable mix of billed issuance. We continue to take a balanced approach to investments and profitability in Ratings, and through continued expense discipline and improved efficiencies, we expect to deliver margins in the range of 63% to 64% despite the slower expected growth in 2025.\nIn Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8.5% and margins in the range of 47% to 48%. We expect continued robust demand for our energy transition products as well as our market-leading Platts price assessments. Given the long runway and secular tailwinds in this business, we continue to invest to further distance ourselves from competitors in this space. Despite the ongoing investments, we expect to deliver 20 to 120 basis points of margin expansion in CI with an expected margin range of 47% to 48% in 2025.\nIn Mobility, we expect continued strong growth in the range of 7% to 8.5%. We have reinvested revenue upside in the last couple of years, which has tempered margin expansion, but we expect the necessary pace of investment to slow somewhat in 2025. As such, we are expecting margins in the range of 39% to 40%, representing approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint.\nLastly, in Indices, our guidance assumes relatively flat equity asset prices from the end of 2024, given the very strong returns in the S&P 500 over the last 2 years. As such, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%. Given margins are already above our medium-term targets, and given the attractive slate of investment opportunities in indices, we are making the decision to reinvest incremental profit for future growth in 2025. As a result, we expect margins to remain relatively flat to 2024 levels and are guiding to a range of 69.5% to 70.5%.\nI refer you to our supplemental materials on our Investor Relations website for some additional details on our financial guidance, but we are also expecting to deliver approximately $6 billion in adjusted free cash flow in 2020. Since the merger closed, our free cash flow conversion rate or adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income, has been at or above 100% every year and peaked in 2024 as we optimized our working capital and streamlined cash collections. This does create a difficult compare for working capital and free cash flow growth in 2025, but we expect to maintain a free cash flow conversion rate at or above 100% in 2025 as well.\nIn closing, through the various leadership roles I've held over the last 15 years within S&P Global, I've seen the ins and outs of our businesses up close at every stage of the cycle. Our company sits at the crossroads with so many vitally important secular trends: data and artificial intelligence, energy transition, active to passive management and public and private market dynamics. We also sit at the nexus of all the major global markets: equity, fixed income and commodities. We have the right people in place, we are making the right investments, and we are building the right strategy. It's an incredibly exciting time to be at S&P Global.\nWith that, we will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Martina. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take the first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Craig, Interim Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. S&P Global delivered an incredible first half in 2024 as the second quarter saw accelerated revenue growth, significant margin expansion and the highest quarterly adjusted EPS in our company's history.\nTotal revenue increased 16%, excluding the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. Transaction revenue in our Ratings division continues to drive significant outperformance at more than 60% growth. But revenue from all our subscription products across the company also increased 8% year-over-year in the second quarter despite some of the market headwinds that are common across our industry this year.\nWe delivered 450 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and 30% growth in EPS as we captured market demand and contained our expense growth. As you saw last month, we also announced our CEO succession plan, which I'll discuss in a moment.\nWe've been cultivating more than just our leaders at S&P Global, and we're pleased with the product innovation coming to the market in the second quarter. The June release of Cap IQ Pro included significant enhancements, and we launched new benchmarks in Commodity Insights. We continue to accelerate our deployment of generative AI and launched new capabilities both at the division and enterprise level.\nWe also continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products with Visible Alpha closing in the second quarter and the recent signing of an agreement to divest Fincentric, which we expect to close in the third quarter.\nWe're excited that we get to cover key developments in each of our 5 strategic pillars this quarter, beginning with our customers. S&P Global rated more than $1 trillion of billed issuance in the second quarter. Growth was diversified across public and private markets as private market participants increasingly turn to S&P Global for expertise in assessing credit risk.\nRevenue from rating services in the private markets increased more than 70% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to create new products from the combined data sets and solutions of S&P Global and IHS Markit to create incremental value for our customers. In the second quarter, we achieved nearly $200 million of annualized run rate revenue synergies. As Chris will discuss in a moment, this puts us ahead of the pace to achieve the $150 million in revenue synergies we're targeting in 2026.\nIt's remarkable that we're able to deliver these strong results despite the well-known market headwinds that continue to impact pockets of our business. Our diverse customer base and broad product portfolio provide for more stable financial performance for the company overall as headwinds can often be offset by tailwinds.\nAs an example, while renewal rates were slightly lower than last year in Market Intelligence this quarter, renewal rates were slightly higher than last year in Commodity Insights. These market dynamics are not unexpected, and the financial impact was largely included in our initial guidance.\nDespite macroeconomic cyclicality, we continue to find ways to help our customers achieve their goals using our differentiated data and product offerings. This ability to align our product innovation and investment with customer needs was further demonstrated in the second quarter by the acceleration in revenue growth from our Private Market Solutions and our Sustainability & Energy Transition offerings.\nTurning back to billed issuance. It increased 54% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to see tight credit spreads contributing to favorable market conditions. We also saw modest improvement in some of the important macroeconomic indicators, particularly in North America, that have lent strength to the issuance environment.\nWe continue to see particular strength in bank loans and structured finance, along with robust growth in high-yield investment-grade bonds. Refinancing activity was very strong in the quarter as we saw a pull forward of issuance from investment-grade issuers refinancing 2024 maturities as well as speculative grade issuers refinancing 2024 and future year maturities. This leaves some uncertainty around the back half as we wait to see how much of the out-year refinancings get pulled into 2024.\nThis continues to inform our view that the second half will be softer than the first half in terms of billed issuance and transaction revenue in our Ratings business. With the timing and likelihood of any rate cuts in the U.S. market still uncertain, our base case still assumes a modest year-over-year decline in issuance in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Vitality. Newer enhanced products generated $375 million in the second quarter. This represents 11% of our total revenue and an improvement from the 10% we reported last quarter. Key contributors to our Vitality Index are unchanged from last quarter as we see strong demand for CARFAX listings and the CARFAX banking and insurance group. We also see strong growth in energy transition and climate products from our Commodity Insights division and sustainable bonds from Ratings.\nAs you'll recall from last quarter, key contributors from our pricing valuations and reference data as well as several thematic- and factor-based indices matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We're encouraged by the continued acceleration of the pace of innovation of S&P Global and look forward to maintaining our Vitality Index at or above the 10% target.\nAs we look to examples of that innovation, a common thread running through many of the products we're bringing to market is our enterprise expertise in generative AI. In the second quarter, we launched Chat AI on Platts Connect. Launched as a new platform combining Platts Dimensions Pro with IHS Connect, the Platts Connect platform provides access to a truly massive amount of data, research and insights to power the global commodity markets. With the depth and breadth of information in the platform, we knew users would need an intuitive way to navigate and find the information that would be critical to their daily workflows.\nChat AI is a powerful customer tool developed through a partnership of Kensho and Commodity Insights that uses generative AI models to provide real-time responses to conversational user queries to help them quickly find the necessary data to make informed, faster decisions. In addition to this AI-powered interface, Commodity Insights continues to bring new benchmark price assessments to market. Our Platts team introduced 5 daily price assessments for beef and 4 daily price assessments for poultry as well as a new report with up-to-date coverage of the proteins market. These continue to broaden and strengthen our position in agriculture commodities.\nWe also continue to scale new functionality in our differentiated energy transition offerings. We significantly enhanced our global integrated energy model in the second quarter, which now enables modeling and scenario building for energy demand in over 140 countries using deep data sets going back more than 30 years.\nWith our enterprise focus on artificial intelligence, we've continued to develop internal tools, including new functionality in the S&P Spark Assist platform we introduced earlier this year. Approximately 14,000 of our people are using Spark Assist internally after just a few short months. As we shared with you last quarter, this platform is designed to be cost effective, vendor-agnostic, highly scalable and secure by design.\nBy encouraging collaboration across the enterprise, we're able to quickly iterate on time-saving use cases and share those developments across the company. We're already seeing users leverage S&P Spark Assist to optimize code, rewrite configuration files for software migrations and summarize complex documents. We've also used it to aggregate and digest feedback and ideas that we received through our employee engagement surveys in town halls, empowering leadership to more effectively act on what matters the most to our people.\nWe believe this crowd-sourced approach to developing tools shortens the time to discover and develop new applications using gen AI models. Leveraging LLM from multiple sources allows us to benefit from the rapid innovation taking place across the technology ecosystem without being locked into a single vendor.\nLastly, the June release of Cap IQ Pro brought powerful enhancements to the platform that we believe will strengthen our competitive position and create meaningful value for our customers. We fully integrated the fixed income data from IHS Markit, which brings data more than 19 million government agency and corporate fixed income securities and makes it readily available through the Cap IQ platform. This was a tremendous undertaking made possible through the merger that will benefit our existing customers and help potential customers more easily see the incredible value of Cap IQ Pro.\nThe June release also included a complete reimagining of the charting and visualization capabilities within Cap IQ Pro, deploying the technology and expertise that came to us through the ChartIQ acquisition.\nBack to the theme of generative AI. We also introduced transcript summarization within Cap IQ Pro. This new tool was built organically and not only provides a quick summary of earnings calls, it also organizes topics and sentiment and empowers the user to immediately click through and find the direct quotes behind the summaries. And it's built on a foundation of Scribe, developed by Kensho 4 years ago.\nI want to take a moment to discuss an important acquisition that closed in the second quarter. Visible Alpha is well known and highly respected among both our customers and our investors, and we're excited to see the progress the Market Intelligence team has already made since closing the deal in May.\nVisible Alpha compiles highly detailed financial models via direct feed from over 200 contributing brokers. With over 6,000 contributing analysts, including most of the analysts joining us on this call, Visible Alpha has the most detailed and comprehensive consensus estimates available anywhere in the world. We frequently hear from customers that they could not do their jobs without it.\nS&P Global's position as a trusted partner across the financial markets is opening doors for Visible Alpha and private equity, banking and consulting and driving further penetration in asset management and research. Leveraging the strength of S&P Global's relationships, brand and commercial teams, we've already seen a 5% increase in the number of contributing brokers in just the last 3 months.\nIn addition, we've generated over 150 sales leads and closed 10 deals already. We see numerous opportunities to leverage the Visible Alpha platform in conjunction with the differentiated data sets throughout S&P Global to create unique deep sector content. We look forward to sharing new developments in the coming quarters.\nNow turning to a very exciting announcement we made in the second quarter that fittingly comes under our 4 strategic pillar, lead and inspire. In June, we announced that I will be retiring from my role as President and CEO of S&P Global effective November 1. Martina Cheung, the President of Ratings and Sponsor of Sustainable1, will become the 11th CEO of S&P Global since we were listed on New York Stock Exchange over 90 years ago.\nWe are very pleased to see our succession plan work the way it was designed, with development of strong internal leaders resulting in a unanimous decision from our Board of Directors. I'm focused on delivering strong results over the next few months as I work with Martina on a comprehensive transition plan before she takes over November.\nAs you might have seen, I'll stay on the Board until the next shareholders meeting and on as an adviser until the end of 2025. Martina has already joined the Board of Directors and is working hard to get ready for November. We will have more to say on the transition next quarter, but it's been wonderful to see the outpouring of support and appreciation for Martina from customers, employees and shareholders.\nTurning to our financial results. With strong growth across every division, we continue to meet increasing market demand while maintaining expense discipline. We saw accelerating revenue growth in the quarter. And on a trailing 12-month basis, we have expanded our operating margin by 300 basis points.\nNow let me turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Craig\n\nInterim CFO, Senior VP, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Doug. We finished the second quarter of 2024 with exceptional performance across the entire company with 3 of 5 divisions achieving double-digit growth in both revenue and operating profit.\nReported revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to a record $3.5 billion in the second quarter. And while parts of our market-driven businesses benefited from the tailwinds Doug highlighted earlier, we are also seeing strong performance across strategic investment areas, which I'll touch on shortly.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30% year-over-year to $4.04. This was driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 450 basis points and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count.\nNow turning to strategic investment areas, where I'm pleased to report we saw growth accelerate across all initiatives. Sustainability & Energy Transition revenue grew 23% to $87 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights' energy transition advisory services and subscription offerings. Our Sustainable1 team continues to expand the company's Sustainability & Energy Transition offerings while leveraging cross-divisional industry expertise to provide our customers with broader solutions.\nIn Private Market Solutions, revenue increased by 26% to $134 million. Growth was driven by debt bank loan and CLO ratings and demand for our Private Market Solutions within Market Intelligence, which includes products like [indiscernible] and iLEVEL.\nFor revenue synergies, we exited second quarter with an annualized run rate of $199 million. During the quarter, we recognized $54 million in revenue synergies, which came from a mix of cross-sell activity and revenue generated from new products.\nTurning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the second quarter. Desktop grew 6% or 2% when excluding the impact from the Visible Alpha acquisition. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the continued softness in the financial services end market that we've highlighted previously. Nevertheless, we're focused on adding value for our customers by improving performance and introducing new content and capabilities, including the recent integration of markets fixed income securities data.\nData & Advisory Solutions grew 6% driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in the high-growth areas of our market data and valuations and industry and company data product offerings. Enterprise Solutions grew 11% as loan platforms such as [indiscernible] and our primary markets group were beneficiaries of stronger equity and debt capital market activity in the quarter. For modeling purposes, it's important to note that the Enterprise Solutions business line includes Fincentric.\nCredit & Risk Solutions grew 5% due to demand for our RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect distribution platforms in North America and Europe. RatingsDirect is also benefiting from user adoption of Capital IQ Pro.\nAdjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily driven by an increase in compensation and the impact of the Visible Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with headcount and outside services. Operating profit increased 9%, and operating margin increased 60 basis points to 32.9%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 90 basis points to 33.3%.\nNow turning to Ratings, where we saw exceptional revenue growth of 33%, which exceeded our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 63% in the second quarter, fueled by bank loan and bond issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 9% primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and an increase in new mandates particularly from the return of high-yield issuers.\nAdjusted expenses increased 8% driven by higher compensation, including incentives as well as investments in strategic initiatives. This resulted in a 52% increase in operating profit and an 810 basis point increase in operating margin to 65.8%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 570 basis points to 60.9%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 12% driven by strong performance across all business lines with Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights both growing at double digits. Notably, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Price Assessments business.\nPrice Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 11% and 12%, respectively. Both businesses benefited from strong performance in crude and refined products. In addition, we continue to see favorable commercial conditions across both segments, including strong subscription sales across Middle East, Africa and Asia.\nAdvisory & Transactional Services had an exceptional quarter with revenue growing 32% or 27% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen leaders acquisition. This is driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in Global Trading Services and a pickup in consulting activity, particularly for energy transition-related initiatives.\nUpstream Data and Insights revenue grew by 5% year-over-year benefiting from meaningful contribution from organic investments, including our upstream energy transition offerings as well as continued improvement in retention rates. For the full year, we expect low single-digit growth for upstream.\nAdjusted expenses increased 8% due to higher compensation costs, ongoing investments in growth initiatives and the acquisition of World Hydrogen leaders. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 16%, and operating margin improved by 170 basis points to 47.3%. Trailing 12-month margin increased by 130 basis points to 46.8%.\nNow turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year or 9% when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the aftersales business. Dealer revenue increased 11% year-over-year driven by new business growth in products such as new car listings and continued success in CARFAX.\nManufacturing declined modestly by 1% driven by a decrease in onetime transaction revenue, particularly in our recall business, which can fluctuate based on the level of recall activity in any given period. This was partially offset by another strong quarter of subscription sales.\nFinancials & Other increased 13% as the business line benefited from historically high underwriting volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to planned investments in strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 10% for the quarter, and operating margin improved by 60 basis points to 40.9%. Trailing 12-month margin contracted by 10 basis points to 38.8%.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 12% primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and growth in our Data & Custom Subscriptions offerings. Asset-linked fees were up 16% driven by market appreciation and inflows.\nImpressively, the global ETF market saw record inflows in excess of $300 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, highlighting the continued shift to passive investing and opportunities for future growth. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue grew 4% primarily driven by strong volumes across our equity complex products. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts and real-time data. Expenses increased 4% year-over-year driven by investments in strategic growth initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation expense.\nIndices operating profit increased 15%. And impressively, operating margin expanded by 210 basis points to 70.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, Indices operating margin expanded by 150 basis points to 69.8%.\nLooking at the quarter holistically, we saw broad strength across the business. Market factors like issuance volumes and asset price appreciation contributed to strong growth in our market-driven businesses. And our subscription business lines benefited from the continued investment in our differentiated data, content and workflow capabilities. We are pleased with the profitable growth delivered by the combination of strong customer demand and disciplined execution in the quarter.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.3%, U.S. inflation of 3% and an average price for Brent crude of $84 per barrel. We continue to see fluctuations in the market expectations for rate cuts, though our base case still assumes there will be one rate cut in the U.S. in the second half of 2024.\nWhile the macroeconomic indicators that help inform our guidance are very similar to last quarter, we're significantly raising our financial outlook for the full year. We're increasing our billed issuance forecast for 2024 by nearly 20 percentage points. Given the dramatic increase in issuance in the first half, we now expect growth in billed issuance to be approximately 25% compared to our prior range of 6% to 10%.\nIn our most recent study of debt financing, we examined the volume of debt set to mature over the next several years. We're presenting this data in a slightly different way than we have in the past in the hopes it's more easily interpreted by analysts and investors.\nHere, we compare the amount of S&P Global-rated debt set to mature over the next 6 months, 18 months and so on out more than 7 years as of July 1 in each of the last 3 years. As you can see, there is very little debt set to mature over the second half of 2024, though this is consistent with what we've seen in prior years.\nOn a cumulative basis, the maturity walls coming over the next several years gives us confidence in the long-term strength of our business, though the timing of that refinancing activity remains difficult to predict on a quarter-by-quarter basis. All of these factors impact our new full year guidance calling for higher growth, stronger margins and substantial generation of free cash. This slide illustrates our current guidance for GAAP results.\nWe're once again raising our enterprise outlook for the full year on all headline metrics, given the strength of the second quarter and our improved outlook for the second half. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 125 to 175 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $14.35 to $14.60, representing a $0.50 increase from our prior guidance.\nAdditional details on our consolidated financial guidance can be found in our press release, but I also wanted to note that we've increased our guidance for adjusted free cash flow to approximately $4.7 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance and reflecting the strong results year-to-date.\nMoving to our division outlook. Our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence is unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5%. This guidance reflects the contribution from Visible Alpha, which closed in May, largely offset by the loss of revenue following the divestiture of Fincentric later this quarter. Importantly, for models, Visible Alpha is reported in the Desktop business line for Market Intelligence, which should accelerate on a reported basis in the second half, while Fincentric is reported in the Enterprise Solutions business, which should see a corresponding deceleration in the second half following the divestiture, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nWe're raising our outlook for Ratings business substantially following the second quarter performance. We still expect the second half to be softer than the first, reflecting normal seasonality, but exacerbated by the level of pull forward that we believe took place thus far this year.\nFor the second half, the favorable market conditions and improved visibility inform a slightly more optimistic view around the third quarter and a modest year-over-year decline in both billed issuance and Ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter.\nOur revenue guidance for Commodity Insights is unchanged. We're slightly lowering and tightening the guidance range for Mobility revenue growth. As we noted last quarter and this morning, the recall business has been abnormally soft year-to-date, and we expect that softness to continue in the second half. The recall business is nonrecurring and difficult to predict, but the lowered outlook means that the remainder of the revenue is more predictable, recurring subscription, which gives us confidence in the tighter range of 8% to 9% revenue growth compared to the prior range of 8.5% to 10%.\nWe've also seen significant outperformance in our Indices division in the first half, and we're raising our guidance again. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%, up from 9% to 11%. Importantly, this guidance assumes market levels are essentially flat from levels at the end of June.\nTurning to our margin outlook. For Market Intelligence, while the revenue impacts from Visible Alpha and Fincentric are largely offsetting, the net impact is expected to be modestly dilutive to margins in 2024. As such, we're lowering the margin guidance for Market Intelligence to a range of 33% to 34%.\nFor Ratings, we're raising the margin guidance by 100 basis points to reflect the strong revenue outperformance, partially offset by higher expected incentive compensation expense. Commodity Insights margin guidance is unchanged.\nFor Mobility, given our expectations for softer revenue from the recall business, we now expect margins in the division to be slightly lower in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, down 50 basis points from prior guidance.\nOur margin expectations for Indices are unchanged despite the higher expected revenue growth as we plan to continue investing to position the business for growth through 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I'd like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Mark?\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take the first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Craig, Interim Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing non-GAAP adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP that corresponds to the non-GAAP measures we're providing and contains reconciliations of such GAAP and non-GAAP measures. The financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise.\nI would also like to call your attention to certain European regulations. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company.\nWe are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team whose contact information can be found in the release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. S&P Global is off to a tremendous start for 2024. Total revenue increased 14%, excluding the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. Transaction revenue in our Ratings division drove much of the upside, but importantly, subscription revenue across the entire company increased 8% year-over-year as well.\nStrong growth across the enterprise contributed to quarterly revenue of nearly $3.5 billion, representing the highest quarterly revenue we've ever generated in the history of our company. Execution was its theme in the first quarter. And our efforts to capture market opportunities, combined with discipline on the expense side, led to more than 350 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth of 27%.\nIn addition to the stellar financial results in the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate our leadership across global markets. Capital markets were vibrant in the first quarter, and customers turned to S&P Global to help power their investment, funding and trading activities.\nEquity markets saw strong volumes from both IPOs and M&A. And we saw the highest level of debt issuance since 2021. As the globe grapples with the future of energy security and energy transition, it's no coincidence that this conversation took place on the stage of S&P Global CERAWeek conference and other S&P events around the world.\nAs we power global markets in equity, fixed income, commodities, derivatives and in many industrial verticals, our innovation drives customer value. We'll continue to innovate and invest in our leading data, technology and workflow tools to drive growth, and we'll highlight some of that innovation today.\nAs we look to the 5 strategic pillars we outlined for you at our Investor Day, we're pleased with the progress we've made across the board. While that fifth pillar of execute and deliver is on full display this quarter with the strength of our financial results, we continue to invest in customer relationships, innovation, technology and our people.\nBeginning with our customers, we saw nearly $1 trillion of billed issuance in the first quarter. This represents the dollar value of debt issued by our customers for which they actively sought out a rating from S&P Global. Issuers know that an S&P Global rating provides a credible, trusted and objective measure of their credit risk, and they know that we have the capacity even in a very active market to fully meet their needs.\nWhen we look at the broader financial services landscape, we're certainly not back to what we would consider normal levels in the capital markets overall, but we did see improvement. With the macro and geopolitical uncertainty still facing our customers through this year, we continue to hear some concern about the back half, and many market participants are still carefully evaluating expenses for 2024.\nAll of this is consistent with what we shared in February regarding our expectation that Ratings would see a stronger first half than second half, while Market Intelligence would likely start to see improvements in the growth rates in the back half. Energy customers from all of our divisions and from around the globe converged once again in Houston, Texas for our annual CERAWeek conference. We're thrilled that customers, partners, regulators, government officials and global thought leaders view S&P Global CERAWeek as the premier event of the year.\nCustomer engagement remains vital for S&P Global. And in the first quarter, we had well over 100,000 calls and meetings with customers in addition to the thousands of meaningful interactions our Ratings colleagues had with fixed income investors.\nBilled issuance increased 45% year-over-year in the first quarter. Tight spreads and stabilizing risk appetite in the market created favorable conditions for issuers. We saw investment-grade, high-yield and bank loan volumes all increased as issuers took full advantage to raise debt early in the year. We do expect much of this strength was pull forward from later in 2024, reinforcing our continued view of a stronger first half than second half in issuance volumes.\nThe strength in billed issuance in the quarter also underscored the importance and advantages of a robust public debt market. We saw tremendous growth over the last 2 years in private debt markets, but we began to see early signs of some of that debt being refinanced in the public markets in the first quarter.\nWhile this private to public refinancing activity only represented a low single-digit percent of billed issuance, we've heard from customers that they're saving up to 150 to 200 basis points in their interest rates by refinancing the public markets. We expect the private markets to play an important role going forward as well, and we're working with major private debt partners to deliver risk analytical solutions. Private markets revenue in our Ratings division increased 30% year-over-year in the first quarter.\nTurning to Vitality. We're pleased to see that our Vitality Index continues to account for 10% of our total revenue despite the fact that several strong and fast-growing products matured out of Vitality Index at the end of 2023. As we've called out in the past, this index is meant to highlight the contributions from new or enhanced products. So as products mature, they will no longer be part of the Vitality Index even if they continue to grow rapidly.\nKey contributors were pricing, valuations and reference data as well as several thematic and factor-based indices matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of new innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. That was the case this quarter as products that contributed roughly $80 million of revenue to the Vitality Index in the first quarter of 2023 were no longer in the Vitality Index this quarter. We expect the Vitality Index to increase as a percent of total revenue as we progress through the remainder of the year.\nTurning to some examples of that innovation. In the first quarter, our Commodity Insights team launched a new food and agriculture commodities dashboard, providing a comprehensive view on commodity data as well as new reports and research on energy. Additionally, we launched new price assessments for renewable energy as well as new benchmark prices for the Middle East and Asia. Our energy transition in climate products continued to show rapid growth, nearly 30% year-over-year in the first quarter, supported by the continued innovation in price assessments, new and enhanced data sets and crucial insights solutions.\nWe also introduced an exciting innovation in Market Intelligence. We've spoken at length about the tools and data sets available through our Market Intelligence marketplace. But in the first quarter, we introduced what we are calling blueprints. These blueprints are packages of data sets and tools combined based on specific customer personas and workflows such as private markets performance analytics. We introduced the first 5 blueprints in the first quarter with plans to add more in the coming months. These intuitive combinations allow customers to easily discover how our data and tools can work together to facilitate analytics and workflows in new ways.\nWe're also pleased to see early results from the enterprise AI initiatives we outlined for you last quarter. By elevating artificial intelligence to a position of enterprise-wide strategic focus, we're accelerating the development of new tools, deploying common capabilities across multiple divisions and increasing the value we create for our customers and our shareholders.\nWith our in-house expertise, we've developed tools to help market participants benchmark performance of large language models, specifically for business and finance use cases. The S&P AI benchmarks by Kensho is a project informed by our world-class data and industry expertise. The questions in our benchmark are designed to assess the ability of large language models to understand and solve realistic finance problems, and each question has been verified by an experienced domain expert.\nLastly, we introduced a remarkable tool we call S&P Spark Assist. This is a copilot platform developed jointly between Kensho and our other internal technology teams. We're deploying this platform throughout the organization to improve productivity, facilitate more rapid innovation and reduce the time necessary to accomplish many routine tasks.\nBecause of our proprietary data, the tools and expertise developed through Kensho and remarkable technologies we are working throughout S&P Global, we were able to develop S&P Spark Assist chat interface without relying on a third-party vendor. As a result, we're delivering the power of generative AI to our people in an easy-to-use platform at the cost of less than $1 per user per month. We're incredibly excited about what this tool can do for our people, and we'll provide more details around use cases and productivity as we progress through the year.\nTurning to our financial results. Chris will walk through the first quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we have had an incredible start to 2024. With strong growth across every division, we continue to balance the need to invest for future growth with the opportunity to deliver margin expansion and earnings growth this year.\nRevenue grew double digits as reported. But excluding the impact from the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue increased an impressive 14%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 170 basis points to nearly 47%.\nNow I'll turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, welcome to the call. Over to you.\n\nChristopher Craig\n\nInterim CFO, Senior VP, Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Doug. 2024 got off to a strong start as we saw 3 of 5 divisions achieved double-digit growth. As Doug mentioned, reported revenue grew 10% in the first quarter. And excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue growth was 14%.\nAdjusted expenses grew by only 3% year-over-year as we continue to focus on disciplined execution and benefiting from the Engineering Solutions divestiture. Strong growth and solid execution combined to deliver more than 350 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in the quarter. With our commitment to capital returns over the last 12 months, we've reduced the fully diluted share count by 3% year-over-year. This led to adjusted earnings per share increasing by 27% year-over-year to $4.01.\nNow turning to strategic investment areas. Sustainability & Energy Transition revenue grew 15% to $78 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights energy transition products and benchmark offerings as well as EV transition-related consulting in Mobility. We are continuing to invest in our energy transition offerings where we see opportunities across our divisions.\nMoving to Private Market Solutions. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year to $116 million. Growth was driven by debt and bank loan ratings as well as continued strength in iLEVEL and other Private Market Solutions within Market Intelligence.\nWe continue to build momentum in our revenue synergies and are ahead of schedule toward our $350 million target. We exited the first quarter with an annualized run rate of $184 million. During the first quarter alone, we recognized $56 million in revenue synergies. While the majority of this was from cross-sell initiatives, we are beginning to gain traction with new products as well. As of the end of Q1, we have launched 25 new products through our revenue synergy initiatives, and we plan to launch more than 15 additional synergy products by the end of 2024.\nTurning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the first quarter with all business lines growing in the mid- to high single-digit range. Desktop grew 5% as we continue to focus on speed, performance improvements and the introduction of new content and capabilities, including the expansion of our collection of premium broker research providers within aftermarket research.\nData & Advisory Solutions grew 7% driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in high-growth areas of our company information and analytics and market data and valuation product offerings. Enterprise Solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the debt and equity capital markets and grew over 8% in the quarter.\nCredit & Risk Solutions grew 6%, supported by strong new sales and price realization, particularly for RatingsXpress subscriptions. We saw solid growth in Market Intelligence in Q1 that was in line with our expectations and consistent with what we signaled on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nAdjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, cloud costs and royalties, partially offset by a reduction in outside services expense. Operating profit increased 9%, and the operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32.7%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 50 basis points to 33.1%.\nNow turning to Ratings. As Doug mentioned earlier, we saw issuers take advantage of favorable financing conditions, which led to strong refinancing and opportunistic issuance in the first quarter. Ratings revenue increased 29% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations.\nTransaction revenue grew by 54% in the first quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 8% primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and strong demand for our Rating Evaluation Service and issuer credit rating products.\nAdjusted expenses increased 9% driven by higher compensation, including incentives as well as increased T&E expense as our commercial and analytical teams were actively meeting with issuers to help drive the strong growth we saw in the quarter. This resulted in a 43% increase in operating profit and a 640 basis point increase in operating margin to 64.7%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 290 basis points to 58.5%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 10% following the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 14% and 12%, respectively. We continue to see commercial momentum across both business lines as our established benchmark data and insights products have driven customer conversations about our emerging offerings.\nAdvisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 10% driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in Global Trading Services and an excellent turnout at our premier global energy conference, CERAWeek. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, benefiting from demand for our carbon emissions monitoring offerings as well as improvement in tension rate. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base.\nAdjusted expenses increased 7% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 13%, and operating margin improved by 110 basis points to 47.2%. The trailing 12-month margin increased by 120 basis points to 46.4%.\nNow turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and we also saw solid performance from our financials and other business line.\nDealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by new business growth in products such as new car listings and CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing declined by 3% driven by a decrease in onetime transactional revenue, particularly in our recall and marketing businesses, which was partially offset by growth in subscription sales. It's important to understand that revenue from recall products will fluctuate based on level of activity in any given period.\nFinancials and other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to both planned investments in strategic growth initiatives and the full quarter impact of the Market Scan acquisition. While this resulted in a 100 basis points of margin contraction to 38.1% for the quarter and a 70 basis point reduction to 38.6% for the trailing 12 months, operating profit for Mobility increased by 5% year-over-year.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 14% primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and continued strength in exchange-traded derivative revenue.\nRevenue associated with asset-linked fees was up an impressive 16% in the first quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM, benefiting from both market appreciation and net inflows. We also saw an increase in revenue for OTC products.\nExchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 12% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX products and price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts. Expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily due to increasing investments in strategic growth initiatives as well as an increase in compensation expense.\nIndices operating profit increased 15%, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 72.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins expanded by 30 basis points to 69.3%. In the aggregate, our businesses demonstrated exceptional revenue and margin growth while at the same time permitting us to invest in our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter, giving us a strong start to 2024.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. We've updated our outlook reflecting our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024 as well as the outperformance against our internal estimates during the first quarter.\nOur financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, U.S. inflation of 2.8% and an average price for Brent crude of $85 per barrel. All 3 of these figures are slightly higher than we originally assumed in our outlook in February.\nAdditionally, our original macroeconomic view included the base case assumption for 3 rate cuts by the U.S. Fed, beginning no earlier than June. As we've seen over the last 3 months, market expectations around interest rates have shifted. And while our economists have not formally updated the number of rate cuts in their base case scenario, our financial guidance now assumes fewer than 3 rate cuts in 2024.\nWe're increasing our billed issuance forecast for 2024 by approximately 3 percentage points to a range of 6% to 10%. As we noted last quarter, our initial outlook for 2024 assumed a stronger first half of the year for issuance. Even with that assumption, the first quarter outperformed our expectations, though we believe much of that outperformance is pull forward as issuers look to take advantage of very favorable market conditions. All of these factors impact our new full year guidance calling for higher growth and stronger margins.\nThis slide illustrates our current guidance or GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're now expecting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, reflecting the outperformance in Ratings and Indices in the first quarter, partially offset by slightly softer expectations for issuance in the second half of the year.\nExcluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, we expect revenue growth to be slightly more than 1 percentage point higher than reported revenue growth. We also now expect to deliver stronger margins in 2024 with margin expansion in the range of 100 to 150 basis points compared to our prior guidance of approximately 100 basis points. We're taking a balanced approach to reinvesting for future growth while still expanding margins and remain on track to achieve the Investor Day targets from 2022.\nWe now expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.85 to $14.10, which represents 11% growth at the midpoint. This represents a $0.10 increase from our prior range driven by the increased revenue and profitability outlook for the year.\nWe're also increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, by $100 million despite modestly higher expected CapEx. Higher expected net income and disciplined management of working capital both contribute to the higher expected cash flow for the year.\nMoving to our division outlook. We're reiterating our revenue growth expectations for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Mobility. And we're increasing the growth outlook for Ratings and Indices based on the strength in the first quarter.\nWe're also raising the margin outlook for Indices to reflect the very strong performance year-to-date. While margins were also very strong in our Ratings division in the first quarter, we're reiterating the range for full year margins, which implies approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint.\nSince much of the revenue outperformance in Q1 likely came from pull forward, our full year guidance assumes year-over-year declines in Ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap much stronger comps from last year. As a result, we expect margins to be softer in the back half of the year than in the first half in Ratings.\nWith that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1 to join us. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Thank you.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question."

Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. 2023 was an exciting year for S&P Global, a year of innovation and growth. Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets.\nExcluding Engineering Solutions, which was divested in the second quarter of last year, revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion, and we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come into the high end of our guidance range as we continue to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a commitment to strong capital returns.\nOn the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend, and we've already announced the Board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023, we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow.\nIn addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private market solutions and sustainability and energy transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023, and we're well positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024.\nOur Vitality Index, which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue, actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate. In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the 5 strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders.\nWe know that our success depends on creating value for our customers, and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently.\nThrough deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touch points, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights. We know that certain customer verticals, particularly Financial Services and regional base, had unique challenges in 2023.\nWhile we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continue to demonstrate value for our customers even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic market and geopolitical challenges. Our customers need unique and differentiated data sets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever.\nNow nearly 2 years after the merger, we've put the work of operational integration behind us. And we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation and execution. We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth.\nWe will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services. With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures as you've seen us do historically.\nTurning to the 2023 issuance environment. We saw strong growth in billed issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see issuers returning to the market with billed issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full year 2023 with billed issuance increasing 8%.\nTurning to Vitality. We're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year.\nAs products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index even if they continue to grow rapidly. But we remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year. With 18% growth in revenue from Vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings.\nThis is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams as they not only build great products and features in 2023 but also make sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we are bringing to the table.\nAcross divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to powering global markets in a world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool. It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants.\nAdditionally, in Commodity Insights, we combined the most powerful features of 2 leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data, insights and tools custom-built for commodity market participants.\nIn Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years. And we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution, ChatIQ, to a set of pilot customers in December. We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses.\nWe also launched powerful new tools with our new supplier risk indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets. And we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first stablecoin stability assessment in late 2023.\n2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P B3 corporate bond index in Brazil, multiple cross-asset indices and new sector, factor and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance and sponsorship at the enterprise level.\nIn late 2023, we announced internally that our former Chief Information Officer, Swamy Kocherlakota, would take on the new role as Chief Digital Solutions Officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho, has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer.\nThese changes to our leadership structure around technology and especially around AI are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly 7 years ago. As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast-track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise.\nThere are 4 important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance: first, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience.\nWe're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives. So we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership and insights into our developments.\nAt S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do. And we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and by extension, into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can.\nFortunately, S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary data sets in the world sourced from all 5 divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart.\nAs we've outlined for you in the past, we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data and preventing third parties for monetizing or commercializing our data independently. A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models.\nThe data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource-intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like financial reports, but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call.\nTools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and update it more quickly and frequently.\nThis leads to the third element of our framework: the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before, we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another.\nUltimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price and ultimately growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time.\nWe're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023 and even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond. Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities.\nIn 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress Live to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023. And as more of our people return to our offices around the world, our global people resource groups saw a nearly 50% increase in engagement.\nWe also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th Annual Impact Report and our fifth Annual TCFD Report. We also published our first-ever Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we've been reporting for years, enhancing our disclosures and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report.\nWe're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024.\nTurning to our financial results. Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023.\nWe're pleased to see accelerating growth and margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory towards the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 Investor Day.\nAs we approach the 2-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last 2 years, not only have we brought together 2 world-class organizations, but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets.\nWe integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world. We're able to close many of our data centers due in part to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio. And we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products.\nLastly, since the merger closed, we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies, then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date, and we'll continue to report our progress there.\nLastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023, and I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023, we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a standalone company. I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to powering global markets as one company.\nNow I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all 5 of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year, revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%.\nMoving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report we saw growth across all categories. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings. Sustainability and energy transition's full year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space, we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business.\nMoving to Private market solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $113 million driven by strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as improved market conditions increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates and MI's software solutions. As we progress towards our goal of $600 million of private market solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023.\nVitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, again surpassing our index target of at least 10%.\nNow turning to synergies. As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million, exceeding our goal of $600 million.\nFor the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies. We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023, and I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target, but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year.\nNow turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cost synergies. On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses.\nWithin compensation, there are 2 factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter.\nAs we go through the divisions, you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting, but total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while revenue increased 7%.\nNow let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9% driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth.\nData & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions grew 8% and 10%, respectively. Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter, supported by strong new sales and price realization.\nWhile renewal rates remain strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter as customers, particularly in the Financial Services vertical, continue to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in nonrecurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year primarily due to higher compensation expense, an increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit increased 18%, and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%.\nFor full year 2023, margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong top line falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned.\nNow turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter, we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance.\nRevenue increased 19% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL.\nAdjusted expenses increased 6% driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance. This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540 basis point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full year 2023, margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10%, following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year-over-year, benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings as well as significant improvement in retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base.\nPrice Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 13%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers.\nAdvisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 8% driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted expenses increased 10% primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10%, and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%.\nThere are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the top line outperformance.\nWe remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities. Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions, increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results.\nDealer revenue increased 14% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 2% year-over-year driven by Planning Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases.\nAdjusted expenses increased 10% driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment already mentioned and also due in part to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and Dealer businesses. We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition. In aggregate, these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, margins contracted 20 basis points to 38.8%.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 5% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and new business activities within Data & Custom Subscriptions. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 22% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX and fixed products and strong price realization.\nData & Custom Subscriptions increased 4% year-over-year driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year-over-year primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses.\nOperating profit in Indices increased 11%, and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%.\nAs we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. We also continue to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you. And we are encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023.\nOn an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps, we're able to execute that debt issuance in a rising rate environment, while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital. With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global.\nNow I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook.\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year.\nWe're currently expecting a soft landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession. So we expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist. We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors.\nFor the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind that flows from active to passive management to continue. Though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business and Indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged but potentially meaningful impact on our asset-linked fees revenue, early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024. The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable, but we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half.\nWe expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility in the evolving regulatory landscape having the potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, U.S. inflation of 2.4% at an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting billed issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024 with stronger growth expected in the first half.\nWhile we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on billed issuance going forward when discussing our outlook for our financial performance as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures.\nTurning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that current year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now, compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year.\nThe maturities expected over the next 2- or 3-year periods are more than 12% higher. While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to delever, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the Ratings revenue targets we're outlining today for 2024.\nNow turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5% driven by strong growth in all 5 divisions.\nWe expect organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity while ensuring that we are making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition and private markets.\nWe expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint. It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly 2 percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately 2 to 3 percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025, 2026 at our Investor Day.\nAs you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability, though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023.\nWith the geopolitical, macroeconomic and market risk and opportunities we've discussed on this call, we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside. And you can count on our focus, determination and discipline over the coming year.\nOur outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023 and continued margin expansion even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward. Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our Investor Day just over a year ago, and we remain committed to those targets.\nMoving to our division outlook. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5% as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses.\nFor Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% driven by billed issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half. We expect some level of pull forward, given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%.\nFor Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%.\nFor Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%.\nLastly, for S&P Dow Jones Indices, we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our Board has authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year.\nAnd with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question."

Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing non-GAAP adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP that corresponds to the non-GAAP measures we're providing. And the earnings release and the supplemental deck contain reconciliations of such GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\nI would also like to call your attention to certain European regulations. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company.\nWe're aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise.\nWe're pleased to report 11% revenue growth in the third quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in every division this quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we took decisive action to protect margins in the second and third quarters last year. And while lapping that impact contributed to our expense growth this quarter, we're pleased to see margins expand approximately 100 basis points despite that headwind.\nAdjusted EPS increased 10% year-over-year, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.10 at the midpoint to reflect the better-than-expected results through the third quarter. Strong financial results like these come as a result of continued innovation and execution, and we're excited about the rapid pace of product launches coming from S&P Global this quarter.\nWe'll be discussing a few of them on the call, but I encourage you to look through the releases available in our online press center to get a better sense of the sheer volume of new products and features we've introduced this quarter. We've seen acceleration in each of the strategic growth areas we've been reporting since our Investor Day.\nWe also saw our Vitality Index reached 12% of total revenue in the quarter as new products continue to generate value for both customers and shareholders. We also made progress on our AI initiatives, which I'll touch on briefly today, but we plan to provide a more holistic update on our progress next quarter.\nWe continue to align our goals and operations against the 5 strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. I'm thrilled with what our team was able to deliver for our customers this quarter. As we lean into our customer conversations and continue to provide innovative solutions to the problems that most need solving, our customers are increasingly viewing S&P Global as a trusted strategic partner.\nIn the third quarter, sales cycles were consistent with the longer cycle we've seen in the last few quarters, though we're encouraged that these conversations with customers are often leading to larger deals. In times of market volatility, uncertainty or change, the global markets has learned to count on S&P Global for differentiated data, powerful workflow tools, important insights and unrivaled benchmarks.\nWe're seeing confirmation of our strategic emphasis on private markets as well as sustainability and energy transition as revenue growth accelerated meaningfully in both those areas this quarter. As we continue to engage with customers, we hear clear indications of long-term optimism despite the near-term uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Our conversations with financial institutions, corporates and others generally revolve around interest rates in the short term with everyone interested in identifying peak interest rates. Large maturity walls along with other factors contribute to our optimism about the multiyear growth trajectory for S&P Global.\nRelated to Ratings, global billed issuance saw a very strong third quarter with 21% growth year-over-year. With credit spreads tightening through the third quarter, issuers were more comfortable coming to the market, though refinancing activity continues to drive the majority of issuance.\nWe also saw better-than-expected activity in bank loans particularly around amend and extend transactions, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, though perhaps not to the same extent. We also saw our relative position CLOs improve again in the third quarter, marking a continuation of the trend we've seen all year.\nVitality revenue is another area of accelerating growth for S&P Global this quarter. Our Vitality revenue metric consists of revenue derived from new or enhanced products. These innovative products contributed 12% of revenue in the third quarter and grew a combined 22% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the 14% growth last quarter.\nYou'll notice that the largest contributors to our Vitality revenue are unchanged from last quarter. While products can and will move out of the Vitality Index over time as they mature, it's encouraging to see growth from these products remain steady and resilient.\nWe're also encouraged by the early signs of growth and traction among many of the smaller products that will likely scale to be the top contributors in the coming quarters and years, including the trends we see in private markets for more transparency in valuation and benchmark products. I'd like to turn to some of those new product launches now.\nWe're seeing strong cross-divisional collaboration driving new ideas with much of that innovation now turning to generally available products. In the third quarter, we introduced multiple data sets from our Mobility division to our Market Intelligence Marketplace, making crucial vehicle forecast and registration data available via both Xpressfeed and Snowflake.\nWe also launched a new single unified platform that marks the product integration of both Platts and IHS Connect. The new platform is called Platts Connect and allows customers access to a comprehensive range of products, benchmarks, data and insights from one easy-to-use interface on desktop and mobile.\nThese 2 products, Mobility and Marketplace and Platts Connect, also highlight 2 of our early opportunities to integrate new AI capabilities. In the coming months and quarters, we'll be introducing intelligent search and other AI-powered functionality that we're currently developing and testing within Marketplace and Platts Connect. We'll have more details on that as we get closer to launching those new features.\nWe also introduced Entity Insights in the third quarter, which brings data from Sustainable1 to our network and regulatory solutions to power KYC third-party risk management and vendor management within a single workflow tool, leveraging data for 27 million global entities.\nI also want to provide an update on our development of ChatIQ. As we've shared with you, ChatIQ is a generative AI product developed jointly between Kensho and our Market Intelligence team. During the third quarter, we had a new beta release that we continue to test internally, but this is a step function improvement over our last internal release.\nGiven our strategic focus, I wanted to provide a bit more detail on the acceleration of our sustainability and energy transition products as we expected in the third quarter. Customer needs have evolved away from ESG scores and moved towards climate and energy transition. We believe we are uniquely visioned to win in this market.\nWhen we talk to customers, we hear clear trends. Customers don't just need a set of opaque scores. They're building internal sustainability frameworks, and they need high-quality raw data.\nWith Trucost, we have what we believe to be the most robust and comprehensive climate data set in the world. We also offer detailed sustainability data on 17,000 companies, including approximately 3,500 that provide robust granular data through our corporate sustainability assessment survey. Companies are seeking to operationalize the risk management around climate, and we have the largest set of real asset level data available with emissions data and climate hazards mapped to 1.6 million physical assets.\nWe also hear consistently from customers that they need help with energy transition, including developing and executing a viable energy transition strategy. We have solutions that cater to customers in different industries, including our automotive value chain carbon accounting solution and the power evaluator solution for energy transition strategies within the crucial power utility sector.\nWe see this customer need across all industries. So this quarter, we also launched the Sustainability Starter Pack. This is a comprehensive solution to help companies start from scratch or from wherever they may be as they develop sustainability strategies.\nWe help them assess materiality, measure greenhouse gas emissions and develop the reports necessary to comply with disclosure requirements and stakeholder demands. Customers need help generating things like a TCFD report and measuring things like greenhouse gas emissions. They need help benchmarking their own progress against peers, and they need help managing the transition to renewable energy sources. We're confident that S&P Global is unparalleled in its ability to provide both the breadth and the depth of offerings necessary to adequately cover all these areas.\nWe're continually increasing the data that we make available through Xpressfeed, and we're pleased to be adding data sets around net zero commitments and biodiversity before year-end. Clearly, we're meeting customers at their point of need, and that's showing up in our results.\nTrucost revenue growth accelerated to 55% year-over-year. Energy transition continues to grow nearly 40%. And our total sustainability and energy transition revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year in the third quarter. While we're very encouraged by these results, we will not rest on our laurels. We remain committed to accelerating product leadership in this vital area and look forward to many new exciting products to come in future quarters and years.\nOf course, our commitment to innovation and customer value also powers our ability to generate value for our shareholders. This is an incredible quarter of accelerating growth. We also continue to demonstrate discipline around expenses as margin expansion in the third quarter helped keep trailing 12-month margins relatively flat year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins improved sequentially from the second quarter, and we expect margins for the full year to expand more than 100 basis points based on the midpoint of our guidance as Ewout will explain in more detail.\nThe economic factors facing the company are largely unchanged as we look to the final few months of 2023. Secular trends continue to serve as strong tailwinds for the company, while cyclical trends can impact different parts of the business in different ways.\nDespite increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape around things like sustainability and continued uncertainty around the timing of the capital markets recovery, S&P Global remains committed to delivering value in all market conditions.\nTurning to the conditions of the debt markets. We're tightening the range of our expectations for billed issuance as we now expect growth of 5% to 7% compared to our prior expectations of 4% to 8%. As we've discussed previously, we introduced the billed issuance reporting metric this year as well as a full year forecast to provide context for the issuance assumptions embedded in our Ratings revenue guidance.\nBilled issuance remains the issuance metric most tightly correlated with our transaction revenue in Ratings. Our latest forecast from the Ratings Research Group now calls for positive market issuance growth for the full year, up from last quarter's expectation for a full year decline. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign in international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen to go through more details around our financial results and outlook. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. This was an exciting quarter for S&P Global as we saw growth accelerate across all 5 of our divisions, and revenue and margins both outperformed our internal expectations.\nAdjusted earnings per share increased 10% year-over-year. While reported revenue grew 8%, this actually understates the accomplishments of the team during the third quarter because excluding Engineering Solutions and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year, revenue growth was an impressive 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by 100 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 4% year-over-year.\nAs you saw in the press release earlier this morning, we plan to continue share count reduction with the launch of an incremental $1.3 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the coming weeks. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all divisions, led by outperformance in our Ratings division, which benefited from elevated issuance activity in the high-yield and bank loan markets.\nWhile the environment remains unpredictable for the debt markets, we saw stronger issuance volume throughout the third quarter than we expected, particularly in September. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, while the adjusted operating income increased 10%.\nAcceleration is further demonstrated by our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 36% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in climate and physical risk products and our energy transition products. As Doug highlighted earlier, we're fulfilling our customer needs for raw data and reporting capabilities around sustainability and energy transition, and this is evident by the third quarter growth. This acceleration reconfirms our continued optimism around the long-term potential of this important part of our growth.\nMoving to Private Market Solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $109 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence private market software solutions, including iLEVEL and a return to strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as bond issuance and private credit estimate activity both improved in the quarter. We're also encouraged by the demand we're seeing in our private market valuation and benchmark offerings.\nVitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $369 million in the third quarter, representing a 22% increase compared to prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, making it the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our Vitality Index score.\nNow turning to synergies. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized $149 million of expense savings due to cost synergies, and our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $588 million. We expect to complete our cost synergy program by year-end with a run rate of approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $25 million in synergies achieved in the third quarter and an annualized run rate of $112 million.\nTurning to expense growth. We are pleased to see that our efforts to optimize our portfolio and deliver cost synergies offset most of the year-over-year expense growth in the third quarter. Our total expenses increased less than 6% year-over-year, though we continue to see some inflationary pressure on compensation expense. Due to the decisive expense actions we took last year, the reset of incentive compensation this year continues to contribute meaningfully to expense growth, though we do not expect any further headwinds from this going forward. We are confident that we continue to strike the appropriate balance between disciplined expense management and investing in our business as evidenced by the volume of new products coming to the market this year and our expectation to deliver more than 100 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the full year at the midpoint of our guidance range.\nNow let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 8%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop grew 5% in the third quarter, driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth continued to outpace revenue growth, partially offset by modest softness in onetime sales. Renewal rates continue to remain strong in the mid- to high 90s range.\nData & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions each grew by 9% in the quarter, benefiting from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products as well as continued double-digit growth in credit analytics.\nAdjusted expenses increased 9% year-over-year, primarily due to compensation expense. Operating profit increased 6%, and the operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 33.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved 140 basis points.\nAs we progress through the fourth quarter, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth as we move into the most favorable comparison quarter for the year. Furthermore, we see the business continuing to benefit from the launch of new products and monetization of cross-sell referrals as part of the division's overall revenue synergy program. As a result, we are tightening our full year guidance for revenue growth by 100 basis points to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% while reaffirming our full year margin outlook.\nNow turning to Ratings. In the third quarter, we saw continued improvements in issuance activity, particularly due to refinancing in the bank loan and high-yield markets. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year, well above our internal expectations.\nHowever, growth was helped by a $19 million cumulative catch-up for customers' self-reported commercial paper issuance in nontransaction revenue, which primarily benefited structured finance. Excluding this impact, Ratings would have grown approximately 17% in the third quarter.\nTransaction revenue grew 34% in the third quarter, driven primarily by growth in bank loan and high-yield issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 13%, primarily due to an increase in annual fees, which includes the catch-up revenue I mentioned previously as well as growth in Ratings Evaluation Service activity and at CRISIL. Excluding the impact of the catch-up revenue, nontransaction revenue would have grown approximately 8%.\nAdjusted expenses increased 18%, primarily due to the write-down of incentive compensation expense in the year-ago period. This resulted in a 22% increase in operating profit and a 70 basis points increase in operating margin to 56.6%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by the relatively low margins in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAs Doug mentioned, we're tightening our billed issuance growth assumption for 2023 to 5% to 7%. This reflects the outperformance we saw in the third quarter, but also reflects our slightly lower expectation for investment-grade issuance in the fourth quarter relative to our prior forecast.\nWhile we expect continued growth in nontransaction, we still see headwinds in issuer credit ratings revenue as fewer new issuers come to the market. As a result, we are increasing Ratings revenue guidance range by 100 basis points, now expecting growth of 6% to 8% for the full year and reiterating our margin guidance.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 11% following a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream data and insights increased approximately 2% year-over-year, benefiting from better-than-expected demand for both content and software as well as slightly improved retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base.\nPrice Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 10%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. We also continue to see strong commercial momentum in our subscription offerings for both business lines.\nAdvisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 33%, driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strong performance in advisory revenue in the quarter. The business line continues to benefit from market-driven volumes, but we're also seeing positive results in key areas of strategic investment, including energy transition.\nAdjusted expenses increased 6%. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 17%, and the operating margin improved 260 basis points to 48.4%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 240 basis points. We continue to see Commodity Insights benefit from strong secular trends around energy transition and sustainability and demand for benchmarks, data and insights.\nFollowing this quarter's strong performance, we are raising the low end and tightening Commodity Insights overall revenue guidance range, now expecting growth of 8.5% to 9.5% for the full year. There's no change to our margin guidance.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year. The team continues to execute well with the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the dealer segment and continued growth in new business in the manufacturing and financials and other segments.\nDealer revenue increased 30% year-over-year, driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products as well as the addition of Market Scan.\nManufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter.\nAdjusted expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation expense, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 10% increase in adjusted operating profit and 20 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 100 basis points.\nWe expect continued strong growth in used car subscription products as we progress through the fourth quarter. We also expect Mobility to continue to benefit from dealerships and OEMs increasing their incentive spend on new vehicles as affordability is hampered by rising rates. As a result, we are narrowing our guidance for revenue growth to a range of 9% to 10% for the full year. There is no change to our margin guidance.\nNow turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, primarily due to gains in exchange-traded derivative volumes and asset-linked fees. We're very pleased to see asset-linked fees return to positive revenue growth in the third quarter.\nRevenues were up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market depreciation and net inflows but was partially offset by mix shift into lower-priced products, continuing the pattern from last quarter. Exchange-traded derivative volume increased 18%, primarily driven by an approximately 20% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume.\nData & Custom Subscriptions increased 2% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 9% year-over-year, with the majority of the increase driven by the write-down of incentive compensation in the year-ago period.\nOperating profit in Indices increased 5%, and the operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 69.4%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 80 basis points. There's no change to our revenue outlook for Indices. However, as a result of the continued cost discipline and outperformance year-to-date, we're increasing our margin guidance for the division to a range of 68% to 69% for the full year.\nNow let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 3.1% in 2023. While outlooks vary somewhat by region, our economists are forecasting a period of subdued global growth fueled by higher-for-longer rates with a soft landing base case assumption as we move through the first half of next year.\nWe continue to expect inflation to remain above the target rates of central banks and energy commodity prices such as crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. For the full year, we assume Brent crude will average approximately $84 per barrel, slightly higher than our last estimate as we expect Brent grew to average $88 in the fourth quarter.\nNow let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the third quarter as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions.\nWe're narrowing our expectations for total revenue growth to a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year to reflect the changes discussed earlier on our divisional revenue outlook. Furthermore, we are maintaining our operating profit margin guidance of 45.5% to 46.5% with the expectation that we will achieve full year margins close to the midpoint of the range.\nWe have provided the granular guidance on corporate and allocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site. This includes a 50 basis point reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate to a range of 20.5% to 21.5%. As a result of this quarter's strong performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing and tightening our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $12.50 to $12.60.\nThe final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, our business has demonstrated exceptional growth across divisions this quarter, while we continue to manage expenses prudently.\nFurthermore, I'm pleased with the progress being made across our cost synergy initiatives and growth across revenue synergies as we see more and more new products coming to the market that would have been impossible without the merger. The teams have done a truly excellent job executing on our key strategic initiatives while still driving profitable growth across all divisions this quarter, and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to 2023.\nAnd with that, I would like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. And we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Edouard Tavernier, President of S&P Global Mobility.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. In addition, we have posted a supplemental slide deck with additional information on our results and guidance. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules or the supplemental deck, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP that corresponds to the non-GAAP measures we're providing, and the earnings release and the supplemental deck contain reconciliations of such GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\nI would also like to call your attention to a specific European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company.\nWe are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise.\nWe're pleased to report 7% revenue growth in the second quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices, while growth remained in the high single digits for both Commodity Insights and Mobility.\nAs you will recall, we took decisive action to protect margins beginning in the second quarter of last year, and lapping those actions led to a modest contraction in adjusted operating margins year-over-year. Our continued focus on delivering profitable growth and prudently managing our capital allocation combined to drive double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this quarter. We expect positive revenue growth in all divisions for the remainder of the year as well as continued double-digit adjusted EPS growth.\nIn addition to strong financial results, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with an emphasis on innovation. We continue to drive rapid advancement in our AI initiatives. We'll talk more about the guiding principles behind our AI strategy in a moment, but we already have a number of internal initiatives and pilot programs.\nAdditionally, in May, we launched a conversational AI assistant called Chat IQ on Capital IQ Pro Labs for internal testing. We'll have more to say about Chat IQ as we get closer to a formal launch to external customers, but it's the first example of how Kensho will deploy LLM-based technology across S&P Global.\nWe're also very excited about some of the developments in our conversations with the largest participants in the private markets. We have an active and incredibly productive dialogue with private equity and private credit customers. We're currently exploring many ways that we can work together to apply our expertise in ratings, analytics and pricing across the credit markets.\nWe'll have more specifics to share here as well as this dialogue develops into commercial opportunities. We're seeing some early but encouraging signs of stabilization in the macro environment, which leads to a modest improvement to the macro outlook, helping to inform our financial guidance.\nLastly, illustrating our commitment to disciplined stewardship of the business, we completed the divestiture of Engineering Solutions in the second quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the 5 strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day.\nFirst, I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. We've mentioned over the last couple of quarters that we've seen some lengthening of the sales cycle, which we believe was driven by customer sensitivity around spending.\nOur cross-sell efforts are also creating larger contracts, which take longer to close. While sales cycles remain a bit longer than normal, we've started to see some stabilization, and customer conversations have been very constructive.\nWe continue to see very high customer retention rates and contract expansions, evidenced by the 8% growth in subscription revenue across our 5 divisions. The value of our largest and most well-known products, those key brands and benchmarks that the markets rely on is being recognized by our customers in a challenging and sometimes confusing macro environment.\nCustomers are also emphasizing many of the same strategic priorities that we are [indiscernible] private markets, climate, energy transition and AI. This is evidenced in the 40% growth in energy transition revenue we saw in our Commodity Insights division in the second quarter.\nAs customers navigate a market with higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly evolving technology, we hear they trust S&P Global, and they want to do more with us. We've worked hard to build that trust, and we're as confident as we've ever been in the long-term growth of the company.\nRelated to Ratings, global billed issuance returned to positive growth, increasing 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. We began to see some signs of stabilizing interest rates among central banks. While we did see some likely event-driven issuance in the second quarter ahead of the debt ceiling events in the United States, we're also seeing more economists, including our own, expecting only 1 or 2 more rate hikes from major central banks over the remainder of 2023.\nOverall, issuance saw a higher proportion of refinancing activity with issuers tracking market conditions closely. We expect those pockets of issuance to become more frequent as the market adjusts to the new normal of higher for longer.\nWe're pleased with the strength we saw in corporate issuance with both high-yield and investment-grade issuance increasing notably year-over-year, though the high-yield growth is coming off of a very low comparison. This strength is offset somewhat by a softer environment for bank loans and structured finance.\nImportantly, rating withdrawals, which are a measure of churn in ratings, are down this year. That illustrates the strength of the S&P brand and the increasing value of a rating in an uncertain credit environment.\nNext, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. The June release of updates and enhancements of Capital IQ Pro was one of the largest and most significant in years. We completely reinvented RatingsDirect on Capital IQ Pro and launched loan pricing and analytics as well.\nCustomers have already shown an incredibly positive reaction to the enhancements on Capital IQ Pro. And these new features have contributed to key competitive displacements and enhanced our competitive positioning.\nIn Commodity Insights, we also launched the first offering of base shipping rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing. This is significant as we expect the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels, including liquid natural gas, to grow significantly in the coming years.\nOur Sustainable1 team launched a new nature and biodiversity risk data set, assessing nature-related impacts and dependencies across the company's operations. This assessment can be applied across the asset, company and portfolio level, which gives our corporate and investor customers a greater ability to quantify both dependency and impact on location-specific ecosystems.\nAs we introduced last quarter, our Vitality revenue metric consists of revenue derived from our new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the second quarter, Vitality revenue held steady at 11% of total revenue. I'm both pleased and impressed that the top 4 contributors to our Vitality revenue in the quarter came from 4 different divisions, clearly demonstrating that our commitment to innovation and growth spans the entire organization.\nTurning now to a topic that I know is on everyone's mind, artificial intelligence. I wanted to provide some color on S&P Global's key advantages and the guiding principles that will govern our use and the implementation of AI, both internally and within our products.\nWe're thrilled with the progress that our teams have made building, testing and implementing tools in various use cases across the organization. While Kensho gives us an incredible advantage in this arena, it isn't our only one. The data sets we have, large, proprietary and truly differentiated, create a remarkable advantage for S&P Global as well.\nOur trusted brands also allow us to have conversations with industry partners, technology infrastructure providers and customers with credibility. We, through our brands, are known and trusted. And we know that trust will play a huge role in the success of any AI-based products that come to market in the coming years.\nAs we more fully embrace the technological advances of our era, we need to make sure we do so with prudence and discipline. Particularly given the investment necessary to develop AI-driven tools, we want to take each step with a keen focus on creating customer value rather than simply creating tools because the technology exists. We will allocate the necessary capital to these new projects based on our confidence in the strategic and financial impact on the company.\nWhile Kensho is deeply engaged in AI research within S&P Global, we want to make sure we aren't dogmatic in our approach. We'll leverage leading technology regardless of whether it was developed at Kensho, developed elsewhere within the divisions or come via a vendor or a partner.\nLastly, we want to continue our practice of aggressively defending and protecting our intellectual property and our data. We have safeguards and restrictions embedded in our contracts that ensure third parties and customers cannot independently monetize or build commercial products with our data without our consent and our economic participation.\nWe're committed to transparency with our shareholders, and we'll provide regular updates on our new product launches as they take place. We'll move fast. And we'll also make the necessary investments in time and resources to ensure success.\nShifting now to how we lead and inspire. During the second quarter, we further demonstrated our commitment to transparency and accountability through the publication of our annual Sustainability Impact Report and TCFD Report. We also published for the first time our annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, highlighting our commitment to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive company and world.\nWe're honored that so many respected organizations have recognized the efforts that we have made to build a company that always pursues excellence. As you can see on this slide, we received recognition not just for our efforts in sustainability and equality but also in our governance and Board oversight and our civic contributions.\nI've never been more proud to be part of S&P Global. Of course, disciplined leadership means delivering on our ongoing operational and financial outcomes. We are pleased with the strong execution across all divisions this quarter. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our divisions in the second quarter, including accelerating revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices.\nWhile our trailing 12-month margins have contracted 90 basis points year-over-year, we expect that trend to improve as we progress through this year and lap the issuance headwinds we saw through most of last year. With half of the year behind us, we still see many of the same macroeconomic factors impacting our business through the remainder of the year.\nWhile we no longer expect a technical recession globally, we do expect headwinds to persist from an economic slowdown, primarily in financial services end markets. We expect to continue to benefit from secular trends though near-term volatility can impact different parts of the business in different ways.\nWhile these market expectations are mostly unchanged from the first half, we wanted to reiterate our confidence in the multiyear financial targets we put out for divisions and for the consolidated company at Investor Day. As you know, our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect billed issuance to be up approximately 4% to 8% for the full year, up 1 point from our prior expectation.\nOur latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance, though also slightly improved from last quarter. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance.\nWe have completed our July 2023 global refinancing study. And you can see one of the reasons for our optimism for our Ratings business over the next several years. There is over $8 trillion of debt rated by S&P Global maturing through 2026 and nearly $13 trillion maturing through 2028. This, in addition to assumed improvements in the macro environment over the next few years, gives us great confidence in our ability to drive profitable multiyear growth in Ratings.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise.\nWe're pleased with the financial performance of the business in the second quarter. The clear indicator is that the secular tailwinds continue to drive growth across our largest products, though some minor headwinds impact smaller parts of the business.\nAdjusted earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 4% revenue growth and a 6% reduction in fully diluted share count, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of operating margin compression. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods but including approximately $10 million from this year's tuck-in acquisitions, revenue growth would have been 7%. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all remaining divisions, including Ratings, which saw a pickup in issuance activity in the quarter.\nWhile the debt markets remain a challenging environment for issuers, this is the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. As Doug mentioned, we also saw acceleration in revenue growth across Market Intelligence and Indices with continued impressive growth in Commodity Insights and Mobility. We will walk through the divisions in more detail in a moment. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, which we'll also discuss in more detail.\nTurning to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue increased 17% to $70 million in the quarter driven by climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. We continue to see a shift in customer appetite away from buying pure ESG scores and towards more purchases of raw data, which we believe will benefit S&P Global in the long run.\nWe consistently hear from customers that our Trucost data set is higher quality than the data from many competitors. And the breadth of our offerings across the commodity markets and ESG indices will contribute to strong growth for multiple years.\nThat said, we are seeing some signs of adverse market sentiment, particularly from large financial institutions in the United States that are impacting our revenue growth in the short term as others in the space have also called out. We believe these headwinds are temporary, while the growth drivers are secular.\nEven though sustainability and energy transition revenue currently represents only a low single-digit percent of our total revenue, it is an important strategic driver of long-term growth. We will continue to make the necessary investments in people, data, product development and partnerships to drive long-term growth.\nGiven the uncertainty around the regulatory landscape and the political climate, particularly in the U.S., we can no longer confidently reiterate the previous 2026 target of $800 million in sustainability and energy transition. We'll continue to report this metric on a quarterly basis, and we will assess the potential for long-term revenue contribution from these important products as the market continues to evolve.\nPrivate market solutions revenue increased 5% to $106 million driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence products for private markets, offset by declines in Ratings private markets revenue. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, of $343 million in the second quarter representing a 14% increase compared to prior year.\nNow turning to synergies. In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized $144 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $574 million, and we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the second quarter and an annualized run rate of $68 million.\nTurning to expense growth. Total adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year as we are beginning to lap the proactive expense management actions taken last year. We saw a $23 million favorable impact from FX in the quarter, and the divestiture of Engineering Solutions was favorable by $50 million. We also generated incremental cost synergies that lowered expense growth by approximately $80 million relative to last year.\nAs you will recall, we lowered accruals for incentive compensation in the second quarter of last year. This was done to reflect the headwinds we were facing, predominantly in our Ratings business.\nIncentive compensation resets each year, so we're seeing the natural increase in those expenses beginning this quarter. Incentive compensation and commissions were the largest single contributor to expense growth in the second quarter.\nThe year-over-year impact of incentive compensation will be a similar driver of expense growth in the third quarter, though we expect expense growth to moderate meaningfully in the fourth quarter as the comparison becomes more favorable. The year-over-year impact of the reset of incentive compensation was a key driver of expense growth in each of our divisions. And we expect to see the same quarterly phasing in our division margin results in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well.\nLastly, we continue to invest to drive long-term growth, and that was reflected this quarter. Core investment growth represents the investments we are making in strategic initiatives, people, cloud as well as the incremental investments we are making to fund our AI development at Kensho and within the divisions. Most importantly, we continue to expect approximately 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year.\nNow let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop grew 4% in the second quarter driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter, though this was offset by some modest softness in nonrecurring sales. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid- to high 90s.\nData & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products as well as double-digit growth in credit analytics.\nAdjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year due to the drivers previously discussed. Operating profit increased 4%, and the operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 32.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved to 220 basis points.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year, and we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year.\nLast quarter, we signaled that we may come in at the low end of our previous guidance range. We're not trying to signal deterioration since April, though we do see modestly elevated risk to the back half. Given the heightened uncertainty, particularly within sustainability and energy transition, we're taking the formal step at this point to modestly lower the guidance by 50 basis points on revenue and operating margin.\nNow turning to Ratings. In the second quarter, we saw a spike in issuance activity, particularly in May, which from a seasonality perspective is a very important month for debt markets.\nRevenue increased 7% year-over-year. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue. And we saw investment-grade and high-yield activity pick up. Nontransaction revenue increased 4% primarily due to annual fees and growth in CRISIL, though nontransaction growth was tempered by continued declines in ICR revenue.\nAdjusted expenses increased 12%. This resulted in a 4% increase in operating profit and a 180 basis point decrease in operating margin to 57.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by last year's revenue declines.\nWe raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first half. Our outlook for transaction revenue for the full year has improved somewhat, though some of this is offset by nontransaction revenue due to greater weakness in ICR than we initially anticipated. The net result is a 1-point increase in our Ratings revenue guidance range, and we now expect Ratings revenue growth of 5% to 7%. While we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, we are reiterating our margin guidance.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 8% driven by double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Growth was tempered somewhat by declines in the Upstream business.\nUpstream Data & Insights declined approximately 2% year-over-year. While subscription ACV growth is positive, we have deprioritized onetime sales in Upstream as we focus on higher-quality recurring revenue products. As such, we are lowering our expectations modestly for Upstream for the full year and now expect that business line to be flat to down slightly for the full year compared to our previous expectation for low single-digit growth.\nPrice Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 11%, respectively, compared to prior year driven by strong performance in crude oil and fuels and refining products and strong commercial momentum in subscription products across both business lines.\nAdvisory and transaction revenue also grew 12% driven by strength in Global Trading Services and strong performance in conference revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 5%. Operating profit for CI increased 12%, and operating margin improved 160 basis points to 45.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have improved 220 basis points.\nWe see stronger trends for our benchmarks, data and insights. And we enjoy a position of trust in the commodity markets. We continue to expect strong subscription growth through the second half, and there is no change to our outlook for revenue or margins.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, the contribution from Market Scan within the Dealer segment and strong underwriting volumes in the financials and other business lines.\nDealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price increases within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 5% year-over-year driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions.\nFinancials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 13% due primarily to the drivers I discussed previously, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition.\nThis resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit and 160 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 60 basis points.\nAs we noted last quarter, we expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. And our guidance for Mobility for the full year is unchanged.\nTurning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 3% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-rated derivatives volume and data subscriptions, partially offset by a modest decline in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 1% year-over-year primarily driven by mix shift into lower-priced index ETF products, partially offset by market appreciation and modest year-over-year net inflows. Importantly, this decline was due to mix shift, not due to price concessions or renegotiated contracts.\nExchange-rated derivatives revenue increased 17% on increased trading volumes across all key contracts. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth.\nDuring the quarter, expenses increased 15% year-over-year due to reasons previously discussed. Operating profit in Indices decreased 2%, and the operating margin decreased 330 basis points from last year's high watermark to 68.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 30 basis points.\nAs reflected in today's results, we've seen market appreciation, the mix of AUM is playing an increasingly important role in asset-linked fees revenue. And net inflows remain somewhat unpredictable in the near term. All of this is reflected in our new higher guidance range.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, our continued investments to drive long-term growth as well as the timing of expense recognition will impact the quarterly phasing of our margins. We expect relatively high expense growth in Indices in the third quarter as well before expense growth moderates in the fourth quarter. This will ultimately allow us to deliver margins within the new higher guidance range of 67.5% to 68.5%.\nNow let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023. We're no longer calling for a global recession, though we do expect lower-than-normal economic activity through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above historical averages as well.\nAs we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the first half as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions.\nOur full year guidance is largely unchanged on a consolidated basis as outperformance in Ratings and Indices is offset by slightly lower expectations for Market Intelligence as we've begun to signal last quarter. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site.\nThe final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.\nIn conclusion, we're pleased with the results from the second quarter, particularly with the return to strong double-digit growth in both Ratings transaction revenue and our adjusted diluted EPS. With multiple variables at play in the markets, we're encouraged by the fact that the tailwinds tend to impact the largest parts of our business, while the headwinds are impacting relatively small contributors to our financial results.\nIt takes tremendous effort from many talented people to deliver results like these. And I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their relentless drive to power global markets. We're looking forward to delivering a strong second half of the year.\nAnd with that, I would like to invite Edouard Tavernier, President of S&P Global Mobility, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Saugata Saha, President of S&P Global Commodity Insights; and Dan Draper, CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today.

However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, S&P Global, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.\nWe're pleased to report 3% revenue growth in the first quarter compared to pro forma results in the year-ago period. We continue to generate substantial synergies and manage our other expenses with discipline as demonstrated by the 1% growth in total adjusted expenses in the first quarter. Our focus on top line growth and expense management resulted in an expansion of more than 100 basis points in the adjusted margin and a 9% year-over-year growth in adjusted EPS.\nIn addition to our strong financial results, we also made progress on many of the strategic initiatives we laid out for you at Investor Day. We continued to prioritize innovation in our technology budgets and reached important milestones in our cloud migration. We also hosted a record-breaking CERAWeek in the first quarter. And we also expanded our lead in AI with Kensho releasing two more commercially available products built on our proprietary AI and machine learning platforms. We'll discuss these important highlights in more detail in a moment.\nOne of the key messages from our Investor Day last December was the introduction of the five pillars that drive our strategy of Powering Global Markets. Beginning this quarter, we'll be discussing our results using that same framework. We use these pillars as a lens to inform our decisions on capital allocation and organic investment that impact our people, our customers and the communities in which we live and work.\nFirst, I want to start with our customers. Delivering value to our customers drives every decision we make at S&P Global. We constantly hear from our customers that they are focused on the same thing as we are. During the first quarter in almost every customer conversation I had, we discussed energy transition and sustainability as well as our products that serve private markets.\nWe continue to see evidence of the value we create for our customers. We saw strong and stable retention rates in the first quarter with year-over-year improvements in Commodity Insights and several products in other divisions. As expected and previously discussed, retention rates in Mobility have declined modestly as automotive inventory levels and volumes start to normalize.\nWe also saw some modest lengthening of the sales cycle in certain parts of the business in the first quarter as some enterprise customers, particularly in Financial Services, are understandably focused on margin protection and managing their own expenses. This is a continuation of what we saw in the back half of last year.\nAs I've met with customers over the last few months, including large automotive OEMs, retail companies, asset managers, banks and others, the recurring theme is that they want to do more with us. There's a large opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of our product offerings and customers have been consistently impressed by the products we've introduced to them. That should ultimately improve customer value and our results.\nWe also look to create quality-of-life improvements in those customer relationships. And our CI teams have done an excellent job of helping customers migrate to enterprise contracts. That migration reduces contract complexity for our customers and enhances the overall customer experience in a meaningful way.\nTurning to our Ratings customers. During the first quarter, global billed issuance in aggregate decreased 7% year-over-year. While we saw strong sequential improvement from issuance levels last quarter, the uncertainty in the banking sector that emerged in March muted the impact to billed issuance for the whole quarter. Refinancing activity was strong in the first quarter, particularly high yield and bank loans, though opportunistic issuance remained muted.\nWe're pleased that billed issuance for investment grade increased in the first quarter, though this was largely due to a few very large deals. We're also pleased with the strength we saw in CLOs in the first quarter. The decision we made last year to preserve capacity and maintain the strength of our analytical organization is already proving to be the right call as our growth in CLOs was particularly strong.\nNext, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. So far this year, we've launched several new products. In an example of our product synergies, teams from Platts and IHS Markit worked together to integrate the Platts Forward Curve into our real-time analytics platform, Energy Studio: Impact. We previewed this innovation at our Investor Day, which provides clients with the most comprehensive and valuable data and insights in the industry while strengthening our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation.\nSo far this year, we've also introduced new Price Assessments for Black Mass in Europe and Asia and for R-PET in India to improve transparency in pricing of battery raw materials and recycled plastics. We remain focused and disciplined in our M&A, completing the acquisitions of TruSight and ChartIQ within Market Intelligence and Market Scan within Mobility. These tuck-in acquisitions strengthen our current offerings, though we expect even this type of M&A activity to be rare for the rest of the year.\nAs discussed at Investor Day, we're introducing our Vitality revenue metric, which consists of revenue derived from new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the first quarter, Vitality revenue constituted 11% of total revenue, consistent with our goal of maintaining a Vitality Index at or above 10%. Much of this growth will be enabled by enhancements to our own data and technology capabilities.\nAs we optimize our technology spend to accelerate the pace of innovation, we're thrilled with the progress made in the first quarter. As we disclosed in February, we announced a strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to collaborate in product development and joint go-to-market initiatives. That partnership allows us to further transition workloads to the cloud and decommission our own data centers, three of which we closed just in the first quarter.\nCross-organization teams also worked diligently to complete two software systems integrations to ensure that the combined company is operating on unified platforms in the most efficient way possible. Initiatives like these allow us to put more resources behind revenue-generating innovation as well, like the AI-powered products that Kensho has been developing for 5 years. There is excitement in the field of artificial intelligence.\nAnd we're extending our leadership and focusing on innovation that will benefit our customers and increase the value of our products. With the commercial launch of two new products in the first quarter, there are five Kensho-branded, AI-powered products commercially available today on the S&P Global Marketplace. We're very excited about the developments in this field, and we'll discuss our own launches in more detail in the coming months.\nShifting now to how we lead and inspire our people, customers and communities. In the first quarter, we launched the ninth iteration of our People First initiative and made investments to expand resources for continuous learning, leadership development and upskilling through our EssentialTECH programs. These investments in our people help us attract, retain and develop incredibly talented people, which ultimately leads to better financial results for our shareholders, too.\nWe also continue to lead and inspire the industries we serve as we power global markets. In the first quarter, we published the inaugural Look Forward report, which outlines the expectations of our economists, analysts, researchers and data experts. This report is a product of our Research Council at S&P Global, which was formed last year to help us look beyond the near term and explore the trends that will shape our collective future.\nLastly, as I mentioned earlier, we hosted CERAWeek in Houston, Texas in March. This conference brought together over 8,000 leaders in the energy industry, who participated in over 650 events to help tackle global issues like energy security, energy transition and sustainability as well as how to navigate the turbulent times in the commodity markets today.\nNow looking across the company, we're pleased with the strong execution of all our divisions this quarter. While we continue to see the impact of the issuance environment in our Ratings division, we're also seeing signs of revenue stabilization as we begin to lap the challenging issuance conditions that began during the first quarter last year.\nWe saw positive revenue growth in all of our other divisions in the first quarter and continue to balance expense management with strategic organic investment to make sure we're well positioned to accelerate our revenue growth over the next few years. Expenses can, of course, be seasonal. So we look at the margins on a trailing 12-month basis. And we expect these figures to improve as we progress through the year.\nAs we look through the remainder of the year, I'd like to touch on some of the factors influencing our company's performance. We continue to expect a mild recession this year, though the timing is more likely a few months later relative to our initial expectations. We also expect to see volatility in various markets, including equities, credit and commodities. We see no change to the secular trends shaping the future opportunities for us, like the shift from active to passive asset management and energy transition.\nWhile these market expectations are mostly unchanged from February, we wanted to highlight the potential impact in the banking market. As we're all aware, the events around regional banks in the U.S. and a major Swiss bank added uncertainty to the markets in March. We do not have material direct exposure to the impacted regional banks. And we do not expect the events in that end market to materially increase the risk to our financial guidance in 2023 or to the medium-term targets we laid out at Investor Day.\nWe do see slightly elevated risk of default rates impacting the broader credit markets, particularly in high yield, which will also inform our updated issuance outlook. Our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect build issuance to be up approximately 3% to 7% for the full year.\nOur latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance, as we've described in recent quarters, with much of the delta this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign and international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 3% revenue growth, 100 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8% reduction in the fully diluted share count. This is an excellent example of strong execution and prudent capital management combining to create long-term shareholder value. And we're pleased with the start to 2023.\nRevenue growth in the quarter was driven by growth in Market Intelligence and strong performance in Commodity Insights and Mobility. This was offset by a lower issuance environment compared to the first quarter of last year, though issuance improved sequentially from the fourth quarter. We'll walk through the divisions in more detail in a moment.\nAdjusted expenses were up only 1% year-over-year, driven by cost synergies and other operational efficiencies. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year as margins expanded to 46.2%.\nI'm pleased to report a sustainability and energy transition revenue increase of 27% to $69 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in sustainability products in MI's climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. Private market solutions revenue remained at the $100 million level as growth in products from Market Intelligence were offset by declines in Ratings due to the timing of private market issuance. We still expect growth in private markets this year to be in line with the targets laid out at Investor Day. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization was $326 million in the first quarter, representing a 17% increase compared to prior year.\nSynergies are a key contributor to expense savings and margin expansion this quarter. In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized $131 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $552 million. And we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the first quarter and an annualized run rate of $52 million.\nTurning to strategic capital allocation. We remain committed to disciplined capital management, including investing for long-term growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. We executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, in the first quarter. And we plan to launch a new $1 billion ASR in the coming weeks, leveraging the proceeds of the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cash on hand.\nWe have been able to take advantage of market dislocations over the last year to repurchase shares at attractive prices, which allowed us to reduce our fully diluted share count by 8% over that time period. Since the close of the merger last year, we have been able to repurchase more than 31% of the shares issued to complete the merger with IHS Markit. We continue to invest in organic growth as well and remain on track to invest $150 million in our 2023 strategic projects.\nNow let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 5%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Credit & Risk Solutions and favorable commercial conditions overall. Desktop grew 3.5% in the first quarter, driven in part by strong demand for new content and capabilities supported by the merger, though growth was tempered somewhat by a continuation of the modest softness in Financial Services that we called out last quarter. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid- to high 90s.\nData & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions benefited from strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat year-over-year as increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and T&E were offset by cost synergies and lower occupancy costs. Operating profit increased 16% and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 32%.\nLooking at the remainder of 2023. We know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital market activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year.\nWe continue to recognize significant cost synergies as well and remain confident in our ability to deliver accelerating growth and full year margin expansion in Market Intelligence. While we are not changing the formal guidance ranges for revenue or adjusted operating margin, we do see increased uncertainty in the markets and within the banking sector specifically. As such, we may come in closer to the low end of these ranges.\nNow turning to Ratings. Despite being down year-over-year, we're encouraged by the improvement we have seen in the issuance environment relative to last quarter. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year. However, this is the second quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue as investment grade and high-yield show pockets of strength in the quarter, particularly in January and February.\nNon-transaction revenue declined 4% and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to declines in initial issuer credit rating and rating evaluation service, partially offset by growth in CRISIL. Adjusted expenses decreased 3%, driven by lower occupancy costs and outside services expenses, partially offset by higher compensation expense. This resulted in a 6% decrease in operating profit and an 80 basis point decrease in operating margin to 58.3%.\nWe raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 3% to 7%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first quarter. We expect to see an improvement in full year transaction revenues compared to our initial expectations, though we expect the upside to be offset by slightly lower contribution from non-transaction due to ICR and RES headwinds.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth accelerated to 9% despite a very high comparison last year. Excluding the impact of the CERAWeek conference, revenue growth for Commodity Insights would have been approximately 6% year-over-year. Growth was partially offset by the loss of revenue related to Russia, which contributed $11 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe Advisory and Transactional Services increased 28% in the quarter, primarily due to CERAWeek as we saw record attendance, coupled with strong sponsorship sales. Upstream Data & Insights declined approximately 1% year-over-year. And subscription growth was offset by reduced one-time sales relative to last year. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expect low single-digit revenue growth in upstream for the full year. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & insights both grew 8% compared to prior year, driven by strong performance in crude oil products and continued commercial momentum.\nAdjusted expenses increased 3%, primarily due to higher event costs, driven by conferences, T&E and compensation, partially offset by realization of cost synergies and lower consulting spend. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expense growth would have been only 1%. Operating profit for CI increased a very strong 17% and operating margin improved 310 basis points to 46.1%.\nWe expect Commodity Insights to continue to benefit from strong demand in Price Assessments and other subscription offerings as well as the continuation of secular trends around energy transition and sustainability. As we saw from the incredible growth at CERAWeek, there remains a remarkable opportunity to further our leadership in the energy sector and in commodities more broadly. And we will continue to invest to capture that opportunity and drive multiyear profitable growth.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, strong recall activity and growth within Planning Solutions products. The Market Scan acquisition contributed approximately 1 point of revenue growth in the quarter and is recognized in the dealer category.\nDealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our planning products and recall activity. Financials and other also increased 11% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment.\nAdjusted expenses increased 8% due to year-over-year increases in headcount, investment in software and additional cloud usage, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. This resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted operating profit and 130 basis points operating margin expansion year-over-year.\nAs we expected, we've seen expense growth rates moderate from fourth quarter. And we continue to expect margin expansion this year. We expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. All of this is reflected in our updated guidance.\nTurning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 1%, primarily due to strong growth in Exchange-Traded Derivatives volumes offset by declines in Asset-Linked Fees. Asset-Linked Fees were down 6%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs, which decreased 4% from the year-ago period as price depreciation more than offset slightly positive year-over-year net inflows.\nExchange-Traded Derivatives revenue increased 30% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including an approximately 59% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions was flat on the quarter. Though excluding the impact of some minor reclassification of revenue as outlined on the slide, growth would have been 5% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for end-of-day and real-time data feeds.\nDuring the quarter, expenses decreased 7% year-over-year, driven by realization of cost synergies, lower bad debt expense and timing of discretionary spend, which was partially offset by continued strategic investments. Operating profit in Indices increased 4% and operating margin improved 250 basis points to 71.8%.\nAs reflected in today's results, Indices will continue to face headwinds in Asset-Linked Fees as the year-over-year depreciation in underlying asset prices impacts the division on a lagged basis. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue was well above our earlier expectations, though these volumes can be volatile and difficult to predict. We continue to invest to achieve the 2025 and 2026 target for 10%-plus growth in Indices. And we expect those investments as well as the timing of certain expenses to drive margins for the full year back within the guidance range.\nIn Engineering Solutions, we saw 2% revenue growth and 4% adjusted expense growth. As noted in our materials, we now expect to close the divestiture of Engineering Solutions next week. We're updating our guidance to reflect the accelerated timeline relative to our initial expectation for a June 30 close. I've had the pleasure of overseeing the Engineering Solutions division since the merger closed. And I would like to thank them for the incredible dedication and professionalism that teams have consistently demonstrated. We're confident that they will be a strong addition to KKR, and wish them all the best.\nNow let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, our guidance still assumes a mild recession in the middle of the year and a modest recovery as we exit 2023. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. This creates favorable commercial conditions for many of our businesses, though it also contributes to volatility in the issuance environment as we have been discussing over the last year.\nAs we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. Now that we have some certainty around the timing of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, we can introduce initial GAAP guidance. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the first quarter results as well as the updated view on the macroeconomic environment, issuance trends, equity valuations and other key drivers as previously outlined.\nOur full year guidance now assumes that strong revenue performance in the first quarter is offset by a lower revenue contribution from Engineering Solutions due to the accelerated timing of the divestiture. The only change to our consolidated full year adjusted guidance is in adjusted free cash flow, which has been reduced by approximately $100 million, primarily driven up by updated assumptions around cash taxes related to the R&D tax credit.\nWe have provided granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest income and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site, though these are unchanged from prior guidance. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.\nIn conclusion, despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we have had a solid start to 2023 and remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to reiterate how excited we are as a management team when we consider the incredible opportunities we have to drive growth and innovation and the secular trends that continue to benefit our business from key investment areas, like energy transition and private markets, to the inspiring breakthroughs that our Kensho team has driven in artificial intelligence and large language models.\nIt's a privilege to discuss the many ways we plan to create long-term shareholder value in the coming years. It's also a privilege to share this stage with leaders like Saugata Saha, President of Commodity Insights; and Dan Draper, CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices, both of whom we'd like to invite to join us for Q&A. And with that, we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nThe matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

A discussion of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing non-GAAP adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nI would also like to call your attention to a specific European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company.\nWe are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Welcome to everyone joining today's earnings call. We're looking forward to a very exciting and innovative year at S&P Global. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we're accelerating the pace of innovation and taking advantage of all we have to drive profitable growth over the next 3 to 5 years.\nIn 2022, we built on our incredible history at S&P Global to position the company to create significant value for our customers, our people and our shareholders in 2023. 2022 is a year of resilience, decisive action and discipline. As we look at our financial highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods.\nAdjusted revenue decreased 4% or 3% on a constant currency basis. As everyone on this call knows, we saw dramatic decreases in debt issuance, which drove the decline in our revenue and earnings. But what you would not be able to tell from the headline revenue growth rate is that our business has become far more diversified and resilient.\nWhile we saw a 26% decrease in our Ratings revenue, the vast majority of that decrease was offset by a 6% growth in our other businesses. That growth came despite FX headwinds, an unstable macroeconomic environment and the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia.\nWe also took decisive action to preserve margins in 2022. Despite significant inflation throughout the year, we're able to keep our adjusted expenses relatively flat year-over-year due to outperformance on our cost synergies and management actions around incentive compensation, discretionary spending and the timing and prioritization of strategic investments. Our teams have a lot to be proud of, and we've done a remarkable job setting the company up for a strong 2023.\nWe introduced our initial guidance today, which includes 4% to 6% revenue growth and a 10% to 12% EPS growth. Importantly, we're not moving Engineering Solutions to discontinued operations. So both of these figures include the half year contribution we expect from Engineering Solutions in 2023. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions, we would have expected revenue growth to be approximately 6% to 8%.\nAmongst the impactful accomplishments in 2022, we completed our merger with IHS Markit and took important steps to optimize both our operations and portfolio of businesses. We optimized our capital structure as well, lowering our average cost of debt at fixed rates, protecting our earnings from further interest rate volatility.\nWe introduced a bold strategic vision at our Investor Day, Powering Global Markets, and outlined our key growth priorities for the next few years. We're looking forward to updating our investors on our progress against those initiatives as we move forward. We also continue to shape the secular transition from active to passive asset management, and just last month, celebrated the 30th anniversary of the first index-based ETF, which was based on our S&P 500 Index.\nAs we look to the strategic initiatives we had at the beginning of 2022, it's clear that we continue to make great strides. We outperformed our original 2022 cost synergy targets by more than 20%, generating $276 million in cost synergies fully realized in 2022 compared to our original target of $210 million to $240 million. We successfully integrated our major infrastructure software systems, including what our ERP vendor told us was the fastest integration ever for a company of our size.\nWe continue to drive commercial momentum, generating nearly 7,000 synergy cross-sell referrals post-merger. We also made great progress with our strategic investments and our transformational initiative to optimize our technology spend.\nLastly, we continued our relentless focus on making sure S&P Global remains a destination of choice for our people and candidates. Our internal people survey indicated 90% or more of our employees endorse our culture and our efforts in diversity.\nWe continue to invest for long-term growth in 2022. We made several small acquisitions to bolster and round out our offerings in private market solutions as well as sustainability and energy transition. We also had several important new product launches and upgrades that will drive customer value and financial performance in 2023 and beyond.\nWe took steps to optimize the portfolio of businesses at S&P Global. We made several merger-related divestitures that were required by regulators, but we also decided to divest the Engineering Solutions division and announced an agreement to sell the business to KKR. These decisions help position S&P Global in growth markets where we can leverage our strengths across the entire business. As always, we will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business and periodically review the portfolio of assets to determine the optimal structure at any given time.\nShifting to our financial performance. The largest macro contributor to our 2022 results has been the sharp decrease in global debt issuance, which continued to deteriorate as we move through 2022. For the full year, we saw a 28% decrease in global rated issuance or a 31% decrease when including the impact of leveraged loans. This is particularly noticeable in high-yield issuance, which decreased 77% from the extraordinarily high levels we saw in 2021. The issuance environment certainly impacted our financials in 2022, but we were pleased with the execution from the teams across the company despite those challenges.\nAs I mentioned previously, our aggregate financial results provide clear evidence of our commitment to disciplined execution. Excluding the Ratings business, revenue growth would have been 6% in 2022 and adjusted operating margin would have expanded by approximately 200 basis points. Ewout will discuss the fourth quarter financials in a moment.\nEach of our divisions performed admirably in 2022. We saw positive revenue growth in 4 of our 6 divisions and constant currency growth in 5 of our 6 divisions. We believe the strength and discipline shown in 2022 sets us up for a return to positive overall revenue growth and margin expansion in 2023.\nWe continue to deliver impressive results in Sustainable1. In 2022, we grew ESG and climate revenue by 50% year-over-year to more than $200 million. As we outlined at Investor Day, and as you'll see in the appendix, we've updated our methodology beginning in 2023 to include all of our sustainability and energy transition products. And we'll be disclosing sustainability and energy transition revenues rather than just ESG revenue going forward.\nUnder the new methodology, we generated $247 million in 2022, and we expect growth of more than 30% from that base in 2023. We ended 2022 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $40 billion. That growth is particularly impressive when you consider it is the net impact of an 18% increase in AUM from net flows and a 14% reduction in AUM from price depreciation, resulting in 4% net growth year-over-year.\nWe continue to launch new indices based on climate or sustainability factors in 2022, including the new S&P/BMV Green, Social and Sustainable Target Duration Bond Index. We also launched new products in Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Mobility. Within Ratings, we completed 133 sustainable financing options, 33 Green Evaluations and 100 Second Party Opinions. At the core of our sustainability efforts are the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. These remain a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world.\nFor the methodology year that ends in March 2023, we have already increased CSA survey participation in more than 2,900 companies, representing a 30% growth year-over-year. We expect more than 3,000 companies to participate by the end of March.\nThe company also continued to advance its own industry-leading practices and sustainability. We issued our 11th Annual Sustainability Impact Report and fourth Annual TCFD report. We launched $1.25 billion in sustainability linked notes and adopted the sustainability linked bond framework. We ensured the long funding for the S&P Global Foundation via a onetime grant of $200 million. And our efforts continue to receive recognition from several leading third parties.\nI'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2023. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11.1 trillion over the next 5 years. This is actually up 3% from the study a year ago and up 7% from last year's study when looking out over the full 9 years.\nImportantly, this shows us how the maturities have evolved over the next few years, while 2023 expected maturities have unsurprisingly decreased over the course of 2022. If we look at maturities in the years 2025 to 2027, we see a 12% increase from last year's study. That increase jumps to 23% looking at maturities in 2027 to 2029. The bottom line is that there is a very healthy pipeline of debt maturities coming over the next several years.\nNow looking at total rated debt outstanding. We continue to see a compound growth rate of 5% and a continued year-over-year increase in total debt outstanding on a constant currency basis. Historically, outstanding debt usually gets refinanced, and we don't see any reason why this decades long trend would change.\nAfter marked declines in issuance in 2022, our Ratings research group anticipates that issuance will return to positive growth in 2023. The forecast calls for issuance gains of 8.5% for nonfinancials, 3% for Financial Services, 5% for U.S. public finance and a decrease in structured finance of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast and does not include leverage loans.\nOur financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuances we have described in recent quarters. For 2023, we expect billed issuance to be up approximately 2% to 6% for the full year.\nNow let's move to the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.2% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, we also expect it to be a story of 2 halves. Right now, we're assuming a mild recession in the first half followed by stabilization in the second half. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2023.\nThere are a number of potential positive impacts this year and potential headwinds, many of which we've outlined on this slide. There are also a number of factors that could impact our business positively or negatively or different ways in different parts of the business. Volatility in the equities and commodities markets is a great example as it can be a headwind to certain parts of our business while serving as a tailwind to Global Trading Services and Commodity Insights and Exchange-Traded Derivatives in our Indices business.\nWhile we certainly aren't immune to the macroeconomic environment, we're confident that investing for growth in these times of uncertainty and through the cycle is the right way to create long-term shareholder value. While others may give in to the temptation to hunker down, we want to make sure that we're aggressively taking the steps to position S&P Global for years of profitable growth. That's why I'm so excited to finish my prepared remarks on this slide.\nWe're optimizing our technology spend for growth. We're leveraging the most powerful platforms available to make sure our product development teams can rapidly bring new features and products to market.\nWe recently announced a long-term strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to further technology vision we laid out for you at Investor Day. This agreement allows us to consolidate contracts and drive long-term savings through a collaborative relationship with one of the world's most innovative technology companies.\nKensho continues to be a key contributor to the culture of innovation within S&P Global. We have a bold vision for how to leverage the newest breakthroughs in machine learning, artificial intelligence. And not only make those technologies available to our customers, but truly embed them throughout the organization to drive growth and efficiency.\nI visited Kensho's offices last fall and was impressed to see the work that Kensho's R&D team have been doing with respect to large language models and their transformative potential. Since then, Kensho has made significant progress on models that leverage unique data across the enterprise with the potential to power innovation using AI and machine learning to accelerate product and technology agendas across all of S&P Global. This is very exciting.\nWe will also continue to make strategic organic investments in areas like private markets and sustainability and energy transition. And we'll selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions that enhance our growth and innovation.\nAs we begin reporting our vitality revenue this year, we will continue our long practice of transparency and accountability. It is truly an exciting time to be at S&P Global.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & President of S&P Global Engineering Solutions, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. The adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods.\nLet me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Adjusted revenue decreased 6% to $2.9 billion, largely driven by a challenging issuance environment and macroeconomic conditions. Excluding Ratings, fourth quarter revenue would have increased 4% year-over-year.\nAdjusted corporate and allocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat for the full year, demonstrating strong expense discipline across the company. For the fourth quarter, expenses decreased 4% compared to prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin contracted by 160 basis points to 41.2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in Ratings. Excluding Ratings, adjusted margins would have improved more than 280 basis points year-over-year.\nOur adjusted net interest expense increased 9% driven by higher total debt levels, partially offset by lower average cost of debt. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but right around the midpoint of the guidance range we provided for the full year.\nWe exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the fourth quarter were approximately $175 million in merger-related expenses, the details of which can be found in the Appendix.\nWe generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we completed our $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program with final share delivery executed earlier this week.\nTurning to expenses. As I noted, we managed to keep adjusted expenses roughly flat for 2022 despite a high inflationary environment. I'm pleased to report we acted decisively and delivered more than $400 million in expense reductions for the full year. Actions taken include pull forward and synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments, selective hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas.\nLooking more closely at the largest contributor to those expense savings, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress specifically. In 2022, we have achieved $276 million in cumulative cost synergies and our annualized run rate exiting the fourth quarter was $422 million, representing 70% of target after only 10 months. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies with $19 million in cumulative synergies achieved and an annualized run rate of $34 million. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the fourth quarter is $807 million.\nFor 2023, we expect to achieve cost synergies and revenue synergies of approximately $510 million and $60 million, respectively. We originally targeted 80% of cost synergies in 2023. But with the outperformance in 2022, we're now targeting 85% of the $600 million target. We also originally expected 50% of our revenue synergies in 2024. But with the divestiture of Engineering Solutions, we now expect approximately 45%, though the full target of $350 million is unchanged.\nNow let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 3% with strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions, offset by slower growth in Desktop and declines in Enterprise Solutions. Adjusted expenses decreased 2% this quarter, driven by continued realization of cost synergies, lower incentive compensation and real estate spend. Segment operating profit increased 16%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 360 basis points to 31.4%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 31.8%.\nLooking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was down 4% and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 4%. For Desktop, we continue to see strong demand for our subscription offerings like Capital IQ. Overall Desktop growth was below our expectations though due primarily to the impact of some onetime sales from products reported in our Desktop line.\nFor Enterprise Solutions, softness in our capital markets volume-based products continue to weigh in on the business line's performance as revenue decreased 4%. This was partially offset by strength in private market software solutions.\nNow turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted, with revenue decreasing 29% year-over-year. Transaction revenues saw a slight improvement sequentially but decreased 51% compared to the prior year on continued softness in issuance. Nontransaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower initial issuer credit ratings and Rating Evaluation Services, partially offset by increases in CRISIL. As a reminder, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively. And the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions.\nIn the fourth quarter, surveillance and frequent issuer fees increased year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted expenses decreased 13% primarily driven by disciplined expense management and lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary expense. This resulted in a 40% decrease in segment operating profit and a 910 basis point decrease in segment operating profit margin to 48%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 55.9%.\nNow looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor was the well-documented decline in issuance, partially offset by 6% growth in CRISIL and other revenue.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 4%, driven by solid performance across all business lines. However, that growth was impacted by a $13 million headwind due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a $4 million commercial settlement in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of Russia-Ukraine and this commercial settlement, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nIt's important to note, we suspended commercial operations in Russia in March of 2022. Therefore, the first quarter of 2023 is the last remaining period that we will see a material impact in the year-over-year growth rates.\nAdjusted expenses were roughly flat for the quarter primarily due to higher compensation, an increase in T&E expense and bad debt provision, partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and advertising and promotion costs. Segment operating profit increased 10%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 44.6%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 44.3%.\nLooking across the Commodity Insights business categories, Price Assessments grew 5% compared to prior year driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings, particularly in gas and power and liquefied natural gas. Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued strength in gas power and renewables. Advisory & Transactional Services increased 3% in the quarter as we saw higher demand from energy transition advisory solutions, partially offset by revenues generated from a 2021 event that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMoving to upstream. I'm pleased to report that business line grew 4% in the fourth quarter. While upstream ACV has had good momentum ex Russia, the revenue growth this quarter was primarily driven by upfront revenue recognition of certain software products that are not recurring. We expect upstream growth in the low single-digit range for 2023.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year driven primarily by strong and broad-based performance across Dealer, Manufacturing and Financials. Adjusted expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter driven by increases in headcount versus the year-ago period, timing of advertising spend and cloud expenses. We expect expense growth to moderate in 2023. This resulted in a 2% decrease in adjusted operating profit and 380 basis points of margin compression year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39%.\nDealer revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX subscription products. Manufacturing grew 8% year-over-year, driven by strength in both Automotive Solutions and the conclusion of several major recall deals. Financials and Other increased 10%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting volumes and new business.\nTurning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year as growth in Exchange-Traded Derivatives offset declines in Asset-Linked Fees revenue. During the quarter, adjusted expenses increased 8% as there was an uptick in onetime outside service spend and continued strategic investments, partially offset by decreases in compensation and other discretionary areas. Segment operating profit increased 2%, and the segment operating profit margin decreased 140 basis points to 62.2%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.4%.\nAsset-Linked Fees were down 2%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue increased 34% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 70% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6%, driven by new business activities and price realization.\nOver the past year, market depreciation totaled $506 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $157 billion, and this resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.6 trillion, which is a 12% decrease compared to 1 year ago. Our average ETF AUM decreased 8% year-over-year.\nEngineering Solutions revenue declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to planned investment spend, offset by favorable FX.\nBefore moving to guidance, I wanted to highlight some of the key drivers of our expected 2023 results and how these tie in with the core messages we delivered at our Investor Day. S&P Global is all about growth. 2023 will be a year of growth across the company driven by customer growth, product enhancements, revenue synergies and strategic initiatives. We'll continue to invest in our people, and you will see the annual reset of our incentive compensation targets. We'll also continue to invest in technology as we drive innovation and position the company for accelerating growth.\nIn order to help investors see and assess the positive impact of these investments, we'll begin disclosing a few new metrics with our first quarter 2023 results, including our Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation either new or enhanced products from across the organization. We'll also disclose the revenue generated from products in our 2 key strategic investment areas, private markets as well as sustainability and energy transition.\nIn addition to these new disclosures, we'll begin a regular cadence of inter-quarter disclosures to help investors measure performance of market observable products. We'll begin disclosing ETD volumes and the year-over-year growth rate of billed issuance on a monthly basis in arrears starting later this month when we will disclose the January 2023 data. In addition to the monthly disclosures I just outlined, we'll also disclose billed issuance volumes on a quarterly basis broken out between investment grade and high yield. We know that in a volatile and potentially uncertain market, transparency and accountability are more important than ever. And S&P Global maintains its commitment to best-in-class disclosure and reporting for our shareholders.\nNow moving to guidance. As noted in our press release, due to the pending divestiture of Engineering Solutions, we'll not be providing GAAP guidance at this time.\nAnd this slide depicts our initial 2023 adjusted guidance. For revenue, we expect 4% to 6% growth, reflecting our continued belief of a mild recession in the first half of 2023 and then some economic strengthening in the back half of the year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Engineering Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be between 6% to 8%. We expect corporate unallocated expense of $140 million to $150 million. The year-over-year growth is driven in part by a reset of incentive compensation and the expectation of approximately $10 million to $20 million in stranded costs from Engineering Solutions post divestiture.\nWe expect to expand operating margin to the range of 45.5% to 46.5%; diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization, of $12.35 to $12.55, which is an 11% year-over-year increase from the midpoint. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion.\nWe continue to target a return of at least 85% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We also plan to utilize the net after-tax proceeds from the Engineering Solutions divestiture for share repurchases. As such, our Board has authorized a $3.3 billion share buyback for 2023, which we plan to begin with a $500 million ASR, which we expect to launch in the coming weeks. Lastly, we expect a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share.\nThe following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Beginning with Market Intelligence, we expect growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margins between 34% and 35%. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, this is a skilled business that's well positioned in growing markets such as private markets and supply chain, and we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth as we lap the 2022 headwinds from volume-driven businesses and FX.\nIn Ratings, we expect revenue to grow between 4% and 6% with growth to be driven by volume and price and continued growth in nontransaction revenue. Our assumption is for billed issuance to be up between 2% and 6% in 2023. Margins for Ratings are expected to be between 56% and 57%.\nIn Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margin between 46% and 47%. We expect continued strength in commodity markets generally and look forward to lapping the Russia impact after the first quarter. Similar to our Market Intelligence division, we expect Commodity Insights to see expense benefit from further realization of synergies in 2023.\nIn Mobility, we expect revenue to grow between 6.5% and 8.5% and margins between 39% and 40% driven by some normalization of auto supply chain, price realization, new business and new product adoption. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate quickly and substantially from the outsized increase in the fourth quarter. We expect expense growth to be below revenue growth in 2023.\nIn Indices, we expect revenue to be flat to up 2% with margins of 66% to 67%. As we indicated at our Investor Day, revenue from Asset-Linked Fees lags movements in underlying asset prices, so the 2022 decline in the S&P 500 will negatively impact this year's revenue. We'll also lap the very strong comps in Exchange-Traded Derivatives.\nBefore we turn it over for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to thank our people at S&P Global. The highlight of 2022 was the closing of our merger with IHS Markit. But what made it a highlight was the incredible dedication and execution demonstrated by our people. We saw strong decisive action in the speed of execution of our cost synergy plan. We delivered critical system integration along a very fast time line, rationalized our real estate footprint and at the same time, continued our strategic investments. 2022 truly was a year of transformation, but it was also a year of foundation. We intend to build on that foundation and drive strong growth in 2023 and for the years to come.\nAnd with that, we'll have Adam and Martina join us and turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Ewout. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question."

Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. The matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.\nAny such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing non-GAAP adjusted financial information.

The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nI would also like to call your attention to a specific European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the investor and the company. We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. We're pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we're growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams, and that balance has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters.\nIt's been nearly 2 years since we announced the merger, and I'm proud of the progress we've made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I'm excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1.\nAs we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex-FX, with growth in 4 of our 6 divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later.\nRecurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we're seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year.\nWe're updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other 4 divisions are unchanged from last quarter.\nI'd also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we're coming up on 2 years since the merger was announced and nearly 8 months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment.\nWe continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence. We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We're on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end.\nTurning to the commercial success we're seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we've generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong.\nDespite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth.\nWe saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it's still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers.\nNow to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter.\nOur non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter. Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year.\nLooking across the 6 divisions. I'm pleased to report positive growth across 4 of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every 2 years. Throughout the year, we've seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result.\nWithin our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx Index families increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information. Whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics.\nI'm pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments, news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we've continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last 6 months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence. Our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of the successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks.\nIn the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on our price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it's still growing at an impressive rate.\nWe understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we're positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in energy transition over the last 2 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the methane performance certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading.\nNow turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year. In the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%. European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia.\nStructured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck. We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength.\nWe launched the S&P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced physical risk exposure scores and financial impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change.\nOur Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 sustainable financing opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies.\nThe S&P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we've seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year.\nNow turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings Research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter.\nYear-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered.\nWith only 2 months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we're using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We'll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we'll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I'm confident that we're well-positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & President of S&P Global Engineering Solutions, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods.\nAdjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive cost. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix.\nWe generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end.\nWe note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we've seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs.\nTurning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas.\nThrough cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022. Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million.\nI'm pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously.\nNow let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data & Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date.\nSegment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognized their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division.\nLooking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter.\nFor Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of desktop to persist in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower rating evaluation services and initial issuer credit ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL. ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively. And the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions.\nExpenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis point decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%.\nNow looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter.\nThere's no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues. Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&E expense, partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs.\nSegment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories. Price Assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy & Resources Data & Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in Gas, Power & Renewables and in Petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter.\nThe Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility's total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX.\nThis resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships' profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted.\nFinancials and Other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices.\nDuring the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index Options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities.\nOver the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022.\nEngineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%. Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period.\nNow moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. Due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices.\nThe net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business.\nInterest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We're also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion.\nThe following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter's performance, we're updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged.\nIn closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the market, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Ewout. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today.

Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Welcome to today's second quarter earnings call.\nOur second quarter results demonstrate the combined efforts of our truly incredible team. After our first 100 days as a combined company, it's clear than ever that after the merger, S&P Global is stronger, more resilient, more diversified and better positioned than ever. We're maintaining fiscal and operational discipline in controlling what can be controlled, which is allowing us to post aggregate results in a challenging issuance environment that would have been inconceivable prior to the merger.\nLet me start with our financial highlights. As a reminder, the adjusted financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year with growth in 5 of our 6 divisions, providing significant ballast against the 26% decrease in Ratings revenue. Recurring revenue increased 5% year-over-year, representing 81% of revenue in the quarter.\nAdjusted expenses only increased 1% as continued investment and inflation pressures on compensation and technology were almost entirely offset by cost synergies in the quarter. We're reinstating our guidance, which reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment, though we will be able to offset some of the EPS impact, as Ewout will discuss in a moment. Importantly, our updated guidance calls for a smaller than 2% decrease in adjusted EPS at the midpoint, illustrating the resilience of the businesses and the positive impact of our capital allocation strategy.\nI would also like to share a few other highlights from the second quarter. As I mentioned, we are now more than 100 days past the merger close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on schedule, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Momentum continues on product development with several areas of innovation that we'll highlight for you on today's call.\nWe see benefits from market volatility in parts of our businesses, and we're able to accelerate our share repurchase efforts relative to our original plan with $8.5 billion near completion at an average share price below $360. We expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion ASR in the coming weeks, which we expect to complete in October, with the final $1 billion to be completed by year-end.\nWe've already seen remarkable progress in our integration efforts in a relatively short period. I am pleased with our progress in integrating our commercial and marketing teams. We've recorded more than 2,000 cross-sell referrals across the divisions. We're also ahead of expectations on our cost synergies, realizing approximately $80 million year-to-date and exiting the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $260 million.\nBeyond the transactional milestones related to the merger, like the necessary divestitures, we've also reached multiple operational milestones. We've standardized business practices, invested in culture and training and established leadership teams multiple layers deep across the enterprise. We're moving fast on our office integration plan and consolidated 10 of our office locations around the world, lowering our real estate costs. We completed our major New York City consolidation and are on track to complete our London consolidation in the fourth quarter.\nWhen we announced the merger, we highlighted our expectation that the combined company would be more agile, innovative and entrepreneurial. And we've seen that in initiatives such as the Data Lake Hackathon led by Kensho's Head of AI Research and teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers and software developers. These teams spent 2 days exploring how to best leverage Kensho tools and other technologies to drive value from the Data Lake data sets, and we're thrilled with what these teams have found in just 2 days.\nIn addition to finding ways that Kensho solutions can add commercial value to unstructured data sets across the Data Lake, we identified new data sets for training Kensho Scribe, NERD, Link and Extract, more than doubling current training data sets in some cases. We also identified data sets to improve S&P Global's country risk assessments and found compelling new ways to classify and improve data for ESG. This hackathon enabled us to better realize the full capabilities of our combined data sets.\nWe also relaunched the cross-divisional S&P Global Research Council with new leadership and membership to reflect the expertise in our combined company following the merger. This council consists of both research and operational leaders with a core mandate to drive customer value and greater insights for markets. One of the first actions of the council was to align on key research themes that have the greatest potential for large-scale disruption and have a meaningful impact on the success of our customers. We'll be leveraging the full capabilities across the company and engaging meaningfully with customers and other stakeholders across industry and regulatory bodies.\nThere is incredible demand for insights and thought leadership on topics like energy security, climate, technology and digital disruptions, supply chains and capital markets. We have unique data sets and insights in all of these areas, and we see the Research Council as a way to make sure that our insights are most impactful for our customers and drive innovation within S&P Global.\nThat focus on accelerating innovation was on full display in the second quarter. We launched exciting new products from Commodity Insights, including a new basin-level methane intensity calculation product for 19 U.S. natural gas production areas. We're using satellite imagery and data models trained in-house to significantly disrupt what has historically been a very manual process using data extracted from self-reported EPA forms. We also launched Carbon Intensity measures for all 6 crude grades in the global Brent benchmark.\nIn Mobility, we saw commercial success from our new Auto Credit Insights product to help deliver insights to financial customers serving the automotive credit space. In Engineering Solutions, we continued to make progress building out our new software platform and have 2 successful proof-of-concept engagements in market now.\nWe continue to innovate in Market Intelligence as well, making new data sets available via feeds and introducing new products like PVR Source, which is a diligence platform aimed at helping clients get ahead of the compliance challenges of an ever-changing regulatory landscape.\nNow to recap the financial results for the second quarter. Revenue decreased 5% to $2.97 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 280 basis points to 47% as both profits and margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate posted strong growth in the quarter, increasing revenue by 7% year-over-year.\nAs you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 46.1% as of the second quarter. Through strong and disciplined execution and prudent capital allocation, we were able to offset much of the earnings impact of the issuance environment, posting fully diluted EPS of $2.81, representing a 7% decrease year-over-year.\nLooking across the 6 divisions, I'm pleased to report positive growth across 5 of our divisions with Ratings executing very well in an extraordinarily difficult issuance environment. Our more diversified portfolio of products provides many opportunities to thrive in uncertain markets, and we saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result.\nWithin our Indices business, we continued to see remarkable strength in our exchange-traded derivatives, which grew more than 60% year-over-year as well as our CDS indices, which increased 40%. Uncertainty in the markets continues to spur demand for our thought leadership and insights and a consolidated platform on which to access information. Whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or supply chain constraints, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating uncertain waters. This helped drive 25% growth in aftermarket research in Market Intelligence.\nIn the second quarter, we celebrated the second anniversary of the S&P Global Marketplace. Customers continue to come to S&P Global as a trusted source for differentiated data around ESG, fundamentals, machine-readable text and workflow tools like our Workbench. We've seen explosive growth in the Marketplace since launch. And in the last year, a nearly 30% increase in the content and solutions available, 75% growth in deals closed and more than 200% growth in engagement as measured by page views.\nNow turning to issuance. During the second quarter, global issuance decreased 37% year-over-year, deteriorating further from what we saw last quarter. In the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 34%. European rated issuance decreased 45%. And in Asia, rated issuance declined 32%. We saw sharp declines in high yield, which was down nearly 80% year-over-year in Asia and was down more than 80% in the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, this is the first time that I can recall seeing declines in every category and every region since I've been doing earnings calls. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck.\nEach year, S&P Dow Jones Indices conducts a survey of assets, as depicted in this slide. Asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 38% to $12.8 trillion as of the end of 2021. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 32% to $9.9 trillion. Numerous indices support the $9.9 trillion, including the S&P 500, the largest with $7 trillion in assets. We've seen strong growth in factor and sector indices as well as many of our ESG and climate-related indices.\nWhile the S&P 500 still accounts for the majority of AUM, we continued to see strong demand for that historic index among asset managers. We saw even faster growth among our other indices in 2021, evidenced by the fact that the S&P 500 accounted for 71% of indexed AUM in 2021, down from 72% in 2020. While this is historical AUM as of December 2021, we're very excited about what this slide will look like in the years to come as we integrate IHS Markit indices like iBoxx and iTraxx and drive commercial innovation in fixed income and cross-asset indices.\nWe delivered extraordinary growth in our ESG initiatives this quarter. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both a reported and organic basis in the second quarter, growing 66% year-over-year to reach nearly $52 million. We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the second quarter, we saw the launch of multiple ESG- and sustainability-related ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the second quarter with AUM and ESG ETFs growing 16% year-over-year to approximately $30 billion.\nOur Indices and Commodity Insights teams continued their collaboration and launched the S&P Battery Metals Index. Within Ratings, we completed 20 ESG evaluations and 34 sustainable financing opinions driven by strong demand for second-party opinions. Lastly, we hosted the S&P Global Sustainable1 Summit with events in several major cities around the world, bringing together leaders from various stakeholder groups to discuss the future of sustainability.\nNow turning to our outlook. Twice a year, we update our global refinancing study. But given the issuance environment, we wanted to provide a bit more color this quarter. Specifically, there are 2 impacts to highlight as investors look at total global debt outstanding. The 2 impacts are average time to maturity and FX rates. When we look at global corporate bond maturities, we see a similar phenomenon to what we have witnessed historically. Over the next 3 years, we see a decrease in near-term maturities as refinancing pushed those maturity dates out. We have witnessed this phenomena in the July update each year, so we aren't surprised by it.\nWhile total global debt maturing over the next 3 years is down significantly from 6 months ago, it's important to note that debt maturing over the next 10 years is not down significantly, and it starts to increase over the next 3 to 5 years. We expect 2024 and 2025 refinancing activity to start next year. This is particularly true for total debt outstanding on an FX-adjusted basis. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since January, foreign-denominated debt is lower by 1% when converted to U.S. dollars at July rates.\nThis slide shows total global debt rated by S&P Global of all maturities on a constant currency basis, which increased 2% if measured at January FX rates. While we don't expect a significant rebound in issuance in the back half of this year, this demonstrates that over the long term, the public debt markets remain very healthy and have a strong history of resilience. They also reinforce our view that the issuance headwinds we're seeing in the market now will likely moderate, if not reverse in the future.\nNow for issuance outlook. S&P Global Ratings research has updated its bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the second quarter and more conservative assumptions around the back half. Global market issuance is now expected to decline approximately 16% year-over-year within a range of down 9% to down 24% in 2022. This forecast implies an approximate 21% decline in the second half compared to the 11% decline seen in the first half.\nNon-financials are expected to see a 30% decrease in issuance, partially tempered by a smaller, roughly 10% decrease in financial services issuance. U.S. public finance and structured finance are expected to soften by 12% and 14%, respectively, and international public finance is expected to be roughly flat. As a reminder, the global debt issuance forecast is a product of the S&P Global Ratings research team and reflects market issuance, including unrated issuance.\nWe wanted to take the opportunity to explain the different categories of issuance that we discuss from time to time. The most frequently cited forecast is out of our S&P Global Ratings research team, which I just outlined, but our Ratings revenue is more closely tied to S&P billed issuance, which is a subset of market issuance. Billed issuance includes leverage loans which are not included in the market issuance forecast. It does not, however, include debt from unrated categories such as medium-term notes and most domestic debt from China, nor would our billed issuance include international public finance.\nWhile there are other nuances as well, these differences in aggregate bridge the gap between our market issuance forecast and the assumption for billed issuance that underpins our Ratings revenue guidance for the year. As Ewout will outline, our Ratings revenue guidance assumes a 30% to 45% decrease in billed issuance.\nLooking beyond issuance, we see a number of secular trends that stand to benefit the company, both this year and beyond. Our experts in Commodity Insights expect oil prices and volatility to remain above historical norms for some time. This volatility often creates more demand among customers for price assessments and benchmarks as well as our data and insights.\nOur Mobility team also expects light vehicle sales to increase next year and beyond, returning to levels more in line with pre-pandemic production by 2025. As volumes continue to grow, we expect to see tailwinds in our Mobility segment across multiple product lines, including CARFAX and automotiveMastermind.\nAs we evaluate the remainder of this year, however, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our outlook. As we noted in June when we suspended guidance, we have seen a deterioration in several economic indicators over the course of the second quarter. We expect slightly lower GDP growth, higher inflation and a lower debt issuance environment to impact not only our businesses, but our customers as well.\nAs Ewout will discuss in a moment, we're seeing inflationary pressure on our costs with approximately 70% of our expenses tied to headcount. That pressure is showing up most in our compensation and technology costs. As a reminder, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions that we make about the global economy when formulating guidance.\nWhile we're not discussing 2023 or beyond on today's call, we're pleased to announce an Investor Day that we expect to hold on December 1 in New York City. We're looking forward to sharing with you some preliminary views on 2023 as well as a more holistic update on our strategy, positioning and medium-term financial targets at that time.\nBefore handing it over to Ewout, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress we're making on integration and the clear proof points we see reinforcing the industrial logic of the merger and the resilience of our businesses. We have a world-class team and appreciate the hard work and dedication of our people in every area across the firm. Our teams continue to execute incredibly well, evidenced by our early outperformance on synergies. And we believe we're positioning the company to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver innovation in the years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through the results and guidance. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & President of S&P Global Engineering Solutions, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. With 5 of our 6 divisions once again posting revenue growth, we continue to see evidence that we are a stronger, more resilient company. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.\nAs Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year-ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods.\nAdjusted corporate unallocated expenses declined from a year ago caused by synergies as well as a combination of reduced incentive and fringe costs as well as the release of certain accruals. Our net interest expense increased 3% as we increased gross debt, partially offset by lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the post-merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction.\nAs most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the second quarter were $220 million in merger-related expenses, the details of which can be found in the appendix.\nWe generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $924 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, as Doug mentioned, we have repurchased $8.5 billion in shares, and we expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We expect that $2.5 billion will be completed in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year-end.\nWe note that the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many foreign currencies year-to-date, and we have seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. Approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility.\nIn addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have an active hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. Year-to-date, we have seen an unfavorable revenue impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound. Expenses saw a favorable impact due to FX movements against those same currencies and the Indian rupee.\nTurning to expenses. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to prudent management of the P&L and shareholder capital. This year, we have already taken decisive actions to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include a reduction in incentive accruals, pull-forward in synergies, adjustments to the timing of select investments, pausing selective hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas.\nWe remain committed to our strategic investments, which are key to the growth of our business. These include investments in our people, innovation, infrastructure and our ability to execute merger-related integration and synergies.\nLooking at the year-over-year change in expenses this quarter, we're clearly seeing the impact of inflation, most notably in compensation expenses. We're also seeing higher cloud and T&E costs, as we highlighted last quarter as well. Even with those headwinds, the decisive actions I outlined, together with our acceleration of synergies and favorable FX, have allowed us to keep expenses relatively flat year-over-year.\nNow I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the second quarter, we have achieved $80 million in cumulative cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $260 million. Through the combined efforts of our teams across the divisions and corporate, we're very pleased to see we're outperforming our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the second quarter is $540 million.\nOur teams have been diligent and disciplined and have pulled forward some of the synergies we previously identified without materially impacting our ability to drive growth and revenue synergies. We have previously said that we expect to realize in 2022 approximately 35% to 40% of the $600 million in cost synergies we are targeting through 2024. We're still operating in an uncertain environment. So while we are not changing the expected range for 2022, we're confident that we are more likely to come out at the higher end of the 35% to 40% target range.\nNow let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. We want to emphasize the increased resilience and stickiness of most of our revenue and the more diversified portfolio of products in our divisions post-merger.\nTo highlight this improvement, we know that in Market Intelligence, recurring revenue, which includes variable recurring revenue, accounted for 96% of total revenue this quarter, slightly higher compared to the same period last year. Expenses increased 6%, primarily due to increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services, offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation.\nMarket Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 8%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 33%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.2%.\nYou can see on the slide our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $25 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. Because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division.\nLooking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 9%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2% and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%.\nFor Enterprise Solutions, we continue to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 8% year-over-year in the quarter. We expect those volume-driven headwinds to persist through the rest of the year.\nWhile we are pleased with the outperformance of Credit & Risk Solutions in the first half, we're lapping some difficult comps in the second half and expect revenue growth to decelerate in that part of the business.\nRatings faced continued difficult market conditions this quarter with revenue declining 26% year-over-year. Expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses as well as lower occupancy cost and favorable FX, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses and T&E spend. This resulted in a 35% decrease in segment operating profit and 850 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 59.8%.\nNon-transaction revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis and decreased 1% as reported, primarily due to lower initial credit ratings and Ratings Evaluation Services revenues, partially offset by increases in CRISIL and annual fees. Transaction revenue decreased 44% on the continued soft issuance already discussed.\nThis slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 39% decrease in Corporates and a 20% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 9%, Governments decreased 15% and the CRISIL and Other category increased 14%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 4%. However, that growth was impacted significantly by the suspension of commercial activity in Russia and Belarus and other impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Adjusting for the impact of that conflict, revenues would have grown approximately 7% compared to prior year. On an annualized run rate basis, this conflict is expected to impact CI revenue and operating income by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively.\nFor this quarter, 90% of Commodity Insights revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses increased 4% primarily due to salary and fringe and increase in T&E expense, partially offset by realization of merger-related synergies. Segment operating profit increased 3%, and the segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 44%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.3%.\nLooking across the Commodity Insights business categories, Price Assessments grew 5% compared to prior year, driven by strong subscription growth from market data offerings and continued commercial momentum. We also saw strong performance from Advisory & Transactional Services and Energy & Resources Data & Insights, both growing 4%, respectively. Upstream Data & Insights increased marginally with second quarter 2022 representing the third consecutive quarter of ACV growth when adjusting for the impact of Russia.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in Planning Solutions and Used Car offerings. For this quarter, 78% of Mobility's revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses grew 5% on planned increases in headcount and advertising expense, which were somewhat offset by a reduction in purchased data and office costs and incentive compensation. This resulted in a 9% growth in adjusted operating profit and 90 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39.5%.\nDealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by strong performance from CARFAX and very high dealer retention as well as growth in new stores. Growth in Manufacturing was 3% year-over-year, driven by demand for supply chain products among suppliers, though growth was tempered by relatively flat original equipment manufacturer or OEM spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products. Financials and Other increased 3%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products, tempered by slowing consumer activity and persistent low volumes across auto sales.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth of 12% year-over-year primarily due to gains in ETD volumes. For this quarter, 83% of Indices revenues were classified as recurring. During the quarter, expenses increased 1% due to increased technology and T&E expense. Segment operating profit increased 16%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 290 basis points to 71.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.6%.\nOnce again, every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset-Linked Fees were up 5%, primarily from AUM-driven gains in mutual funds and ETFs. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue increased 64% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including the more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 6% driven by new business activities.\nOver the past year, ETF AUM net inflows were $231 billion, and market depreciation totaled $352 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is a 5% decrease compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 5% year-over-year.\nRevenue tends to lack changes in asset prices, which helped drive outperformance this quarter. However, we expect asset-linked fees to decrease in the back half of this year. Sequentially versus the end of the first quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $6 billion, and market depreciation totaled $436 billion.\nWithin our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 3% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings, most notably the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. For this quarter, 93% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses increased 5% driven by investment in product development and increased royalties. This resulted in a 7% decline in segment operating profit and 300 basis points contraction to margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.4%.\nSubscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 2% year-over-year, while Non-subscription revenue increased 10% over the same period. As you look toward next quarter for Engineering Solutions, it will be important to remember we'll lap the August 2021 publication of the BPVC, which typically contributes approximately $8 million in the third quarter of odd years but is not published in even years.\nNow moving to our guidance, and this slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. This slide depicts our reinstated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low to mid-single-digit decrease year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses.\nWe now expect corporate unallocated expense between $70 million and $80 million, approximately $15 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecasted incentive compensation. This drives our expectation for adjusted operating margins between 45.3% and 45.8%.\nAs declines in high-margin Ratings revenue disproportionally impacts margins to the downside this year, we wanted to emphasize the margin expansion we expect to see elsewhere in the business. In aggregate, within our 5 non-Ratings divisions, we expect approximately 180 basis points of operating margin expansion this year.\nInterest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, in line with our most recent guidance. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items, in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion.\nThe following slide illustrates our guidance by division. We now expect adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin in the following ranges. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and margins in the low 30s. For Ratings, we now expect revenue declines in the low to mid-20s range and margins in the mid- to high 50s. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and margins in the mid-40s.\nFor Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit range and margins in the high 30s. For Indices, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range and margins in the mid- to high 60s. For Engineering Solutions, we expect low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-teens.\nIn closing, this quarter provides further proof of the resilience of our business. Our ability to outperform on synergies speaks volumes on the focus and discipline of the teams we have at S&P Global. Those teams, combined with a phenomenal set of truly differentiated products and capabilities, position us well to drive profitable growth in the years to come.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Ewout. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. (Operator Instructions) To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you for joining today's S&P Global First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release with our results earlier today.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team, whose contact information can be found in the press release.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Welcome to today's first quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting the historic event that occurred in the first quarter of 2022. We completed our merger with IHS Markit, and I'm incredibly excited to be joining you for our first quarterly earnings call as a combined company.\nThe promise of the merger has already begun to manifest itself in our culture and our financial performance. Beginning with a few financial highlights. We reported strong financial results with adjusted pro forma revenue increasing 2% and adjusted pro forma diluted EPS increasing $0.01 year-over-year despite one of the most challenging issuance environments in recent history.\nWe saw positive revenue growth in 5 of our 6 divisions, including double-digit growth in 3 of them. Adjusted pro forma expenses increased 8% as we continue to invest in events, people and technology, though much of this expense growth is nonrecurring as we'll discuss later on.\nWe're updating our guidance to reflect the increased uncertainty caused by the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. And Ewout will walk through these details in a moment.\nI'd also like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, we completed the merger with IHS Markit and had a number of exciting achievements. We announced a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, and launched the first tranche of $7 billion in March with the remainder to be executed by the end of the year.\nWe took advantage of this still historically low interest rate environment to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of debt. And we had strong attendance at some of the industry's most important conferences, including CERAWeek, World Petrochemical Conference and TPM22.\nWhile we've only been together for 2 months, we're already starting to see validation of our investment thesis, and the results of our comprehensive planning are paying off. We've begun leveraging technology like Kensho across the broader organization to automate processes and increase efficiencies.\nWe've begun development of several new products and features across the divisions. We're integrating our divisional commercial teams, and we've already closed synergy deals in multiple divisions.\nI want to take a moment to touch on culture and leadership. We brought our combined leadership team together in person for the first time in March. We were thrilled to see so many of our colleagues brainstorming, planning, working and functioning as if they had already been together for years. We saw the free exchange of ideas, strong proposals for new growth engines and clear alignment on our strategy, purpose and values.\nWe also heard a unified voice among our leadership in support of our People First initiatives and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We came away energized and full of confidence that we'll be able to take the absolute best, not only from each company but from each person in the organization, and create something exceptional at S&P Global.\nI have never been more inspired by our people. And I'm more excited than ever to work with them to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nWhen we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. We received final regulatory approval on February 25, 2022, and officially closed the merger 3 days later on February 28.\nWe immediately went to work optimizing the capital structure, issuing $5.5 billion in new debt, most of which was used to refinance existing debt at lower rates. We completed that refinancing in April 2022.\nIn order to secure regulatory approval for the merger, we were required to divest a number of businesses. The table on this slide lays out the details of those divestitures. As we have shared with you before, the aggregate revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they were in.\nWe're confident that we negotiated well on behalf of our shareholders in these transactions, evidenced by the approximately 9.5x revenue multiple paid by the acquirers of these businesses in aggregate. Net after-tax proceeds will total $2.85 billion.\nNow to recap the financial results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 2% to $3.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 6% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 340 basis points to 45% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which decreased 60 basis points to 47%.\nIn addition to our strong overall revenue performance and continued expense management, we launched a $7 billion ASR and began optimizing our capital structure. Combined with tax effects of merger-related synergies and prudent investment, we increased adjusted pro forma diluted EPS year-over-year.\nLooking across the 6 divisions, I'm encouraged by the fact that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we were able to deliver strong revenue across 5 of our 6 divisions, including double-digit growth in Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. In line with the expectations we laid out on our call in March, we did see a year-over-year decrease in Ratings, driven by an exceptionally soft issuance environment.\nDuring the first quarter, global bond issuance decreased 12%. This understates the impact to our business, however, as high-yield issuance declined far more dramatically. In the U.S., issuance in aggregate decreased 25% as investment-grade decreased 19%, high-yield decreased 75%, public finance decreased 15%, structured finance increased 9% due to large increases in mortgage-backed securities, offset by declines in structured credit. Bank loan ratings declined 35% year-over-year.\nEuropean issuance decreased 14% as investment-grade decreased 11%, high-yield decreased 54% and structured finance increased 27% due to increases in RMBS and covered bonds, partially offset by declines in ABS, CMBS and structured credit. In Asia, issuance was flat.\nThe next 2 slides look at the difference we saw in the quarter between investment-grade issuance and the issuance of high-yield and leveraged loans. This slide shows that investment-grade issuance is resilient relative to other categories, decreasing only 5% year-over-year.\nThis slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume. This quarter, we saw a decrease of over 50% from the incredible levels in the year-ago period. High-yield was particularly impacted by the uncertainty in the market, with issuance decreasing 68% year-over-year. While difficult to pinpoint exact causes, issuance in the first quarter was impacted, both by the pull-forward we witnessed and discussed last year as well as the intentional delay we're hearing from customers, as many issuers wait for clearer signs of stability before reentering the market.\nNow turning to some of the factors that made this quarter successful for S&P Global. We saw significant increases in engagement and usage of our products and our content this quarter. The metrics on this slide are clear evidence that in periods of increased uncertainty, whether that's in the macroeconomic picture, market volatility or geopolitical tensions, our customers turn to us. They turn to us for the insights, data and tools that they need to make well-informed business and investment decisions.\nIt's also important to remember that S&P Global's stronger, more diverse product portfolio allows areas of the business to thrive in times of elevated volatility and uncertainty. Within the S&P Dow Jones Indices business, we saw more than 20% growth in revenue from our Exchange-Traded Derivatives, whose volumes are directly correlated with market volatility. In the commodities markets, our Global Trading Services business within Commodity Insights grew 17% year-over-year.\nDuring the first quarter, we held a number of premier conferences, attracting thousands of leaders from multiple industries. Several of these conferences returned to being in-person events for the first time in 3 years.\nOne of these was CERAWeek. For some S&P Global Investors, CERAWeek may be unfamiliar. CERAWeek is the world's leading event for the energy industry, taking place in the first quarter each year and hosted in Houston, Texas.\nWe were thrilled to welcome attendees back in person, and it was clear that all of the factors impacting the energy industry right now, industry and government leaders wanted to be there. We had record attendance with over 5,200 delegates, 900 speakers and 50 senior government officials. With the combined resources of S&P Global Platts and IHS Markit, we're confident that CERAWeek will continue to grow and set itself apart as the must-attend event for energy industry leaders.\nWe also hosted the Annual World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM conference in the first quarter. Both conferences aim to help industry leaders navigate some of the most pressing challenges facing our global economy.\nWPC convened this year to discuss how the chemical industry can help facilitate and thrive in a world progressing towards more sustainable operations, including net-zero emissions targets. Our conferences bring people together to drive innovation and growth in different industries, but they also demonstrate the strength of S&P Global as a source and a destination for global leadership.\nWe're thrilled with the progress we've made as we celebrate the first anniversary of Sustainable1. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both a reported and organic basis in the first quarter, growing 57% year-over-year to reach nearly $50 million.\nWe continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the first quarter, we saw the launch of 17 ESG ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the first quarter with AUM in ESG ETFs growing 28% to surpass $33 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams collaborated to launch the S&P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index, and we continue to enhance ESG scores made available through our Capital IQ Pro platform.\nOne of the greatest advantages we have in ESG is the robust set of data that comes to us through the active participation of covered companies. Our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Assessment saw a 64% increase in the number of companies working with us directly to ensure the data sets behind our ESG scores are robust, accurate and comprehensive.\nOur coverage of more than 11,000 companies includes approximately 2,300 which provide data sets and disclosure directly to CSA. Our commitment to active partnership with covered companies ensures our ESG scores are informed by the best data available.\nNow turning to our outlook. We have updated our bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect the decrease seen in the first quarter as well as to better reflect the ongoing impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nWe now expect Global issuance to decline approximately 5% year-over-year within a range of down 14% to flat in 2022. We expect Corporates to see a 12% decrease in issuance, partially offset by a 2% increase in Financial Services issuance. We expect U.S. Public Finance and Structured Finance to each soften by 7% and International Public Finance to shrink by about 1.5%.\nAs we evaluate the remainder of the year, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our guidance. Let me start with our response to the tragic events taking place in Ukraine and the impact on our business.\nAs we've shared with you previously, combined revenue from Russia and Belarus is less than 1% of our total revenue. We have suspended commercial operations in Russia and Belarus, including all customer contracts. We've suspended ratings of Russian entities and removed stocks and bonds listed or domiciled in Russia from our indices.\nWhile the direct financial impact on our business is not material, we acknowledge the indirect impact on the issuance environment and market volatility. We also wanted to illustrate some of the changes in the macroeconomic environment that inform our financial outlook for the company.\nIn addition to lower debt issuance, we now expect slightly lower global GDP growth. Inflation is also likely to have a greater impact on our business and economy as a whole relative to our expectations earlier this year.\nWe're seeing some upward pressure on compensation expense that we expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Commodities prices remain elevated relative to our early expectations as well. To be clear, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions we make about the global economy when formulating guidance.\nBefore handing it over to Ewout, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution and success we've seen in a challenging quarter. Our ability to drive positive growth in both revenue and adjusted pro forma earnings per share in a quarter like this would have been much more challenging before our merger with IHS Markit.\nThe strength, stability and scale of our businesses gives us great confidence to invest for future growth and be optimistic about the years ahead. We remain committed to our strategic organic investments, as illustrated on this slide, and we remain confident these investments will power significant future growth and profitability for the company.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through our results and guidance. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & President of S&P Global Engineering Solutions, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. I want to start by emphasizing the successful execution we saw this quarter. With 5 of our 6 divisions posting pro forma revenue growth, it's already clear that we are more resilient, both operationally and financially as a combined company.\nWith our larger scale and more diversified revenue streams, we're more insulated to volatility in the debt issuance market. As such, we were able to grow pro forma revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year even during a period of sharp decreases in issuance.\nDoug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. But as a reminder, when we discuss financial results from operations and cash flows, we're discussing those results on an adjusted pro forma basis as if S&P Global and IHS Markit were combined for the entirety of all periods presented, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.\nAdjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. We have also made minor refinements to the recast pro forma financials for all 4 quarters of 2021, which can be found in the amended 8-K filed today.\nAdjusted corporate unallocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by a combination of reduced incentive and fringe costs as well as the release of certain benefits accruals. Our net interest expense increased 5% as we increased gross debt, partially offset by lower average rates due to refinancings.\nThe decrease in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and merger-related optimization of capital and liquidity structure. As we introduced last year, we'll continue to disclose these 3 categories of non-GAAP adjustments to provide insights into the type of expenses that we are incurring related to the merger and the synergies we have discussed.\nTransaction costs in the quarter were $281 million. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. Integration costs in the quarter were $58 million. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention cost.\nCost to achieve synergies amounted to $88 million in the quarter. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.\nDuring the first quarter, the non-GAAP operating adjustments collectively totaled to $504 million, including a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of businesses and a $200 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation, in addition to the merger-related items I mentioned. Given the growth in expenses this quarter, we wanted to provide some insight into the drivers, many of which are transitional. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, even excluding the impact of cost synergies.\nIn the first quarter, we recognized $8 million in additional T&E expenses as we saw a limited resumption of travel relative to the last 2 years. We also saw a $10 million increase in advertising expense associated with our Mobility division.\nInvestments in growth initiatives contributed $28 million of the increase. We're specifically disclosing the increase from what we are calling a step-up impact in the quarter. This relates to increases in expenses that we view as a reestablishment of baseline cost.\nThe return of in-person events included several major conferences in the first quarter, as Doug mentioned. Together, these live events added more than $20 million of incremental expense relative to last year when these events were still virtual.\nStep-up costs also incorporate a comprehensive process to align compensation practices across our employee base. One of these changes is to harmonize the timing of annual merit increases to March from April. The pull-forward of the merit increase caused 1 month of impact in the first quarter that did not occur in the year-ago period. We also recognized $15 million in additional expense related to the ongoing cloud transition.\nFree cash flow, excluding certain items, was $701 million in the first 3 months of 2022. Note that this is meant to reflect the estimated free cash flow of the combined company as if the merger were closed on January 1, 2022. We will provide some additional color on the drivers of our cash balance and our gross debt in the next few slides.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong, with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion and debt of $11.4 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was 2.57x.\nAs you can see, our cash balance declined sequentially to $4.4 billion. The single largest driver in the reduction was the $7 billion in cash paid to fund the first tranche of our 2022 $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program. We also received net proceeds from divestitures of $2.6 billion and net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of debt.\nNow to gross debt. We issued $5.5 billion of new debt in the first quarter, $3.5 billion of which has been allocated to refinancing existing debt. After the quarter closed, we also made a final debt redemption payment of $600 million, which brought our adjusted gross debt leverage down to 2.47x.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the first quarter, we have achieved $23 million in cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $135 million. While we are already seeing significant progress in pipeline and customer conversations with only 1 month as a combined company, revenue synergies are negligible. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the first quarter is $365 million.\nNow let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7%, with growth across all product lines. Expenses increased 8%, primarily due to factors I mentioned earlier: investments in technology, especially cloud transition costs, and continued investment in strategic initiatives like ESG.\nSegment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 29%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 30%.\nYou can see on the slide our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $26 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. Because the JV is a 50%-owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division.\nLooking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 7%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 12%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2% and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%.\nAs Doug discussed at length, Ratings faced a challenging issuance environment in the first quarter, with revenue declining 15% year-over-year. Expenses increased 7%, primarily due to compensation expense and information service costs, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. This resulted in a 25% decrease in segment operating profit and 820 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 105 basis points to 62%.\nNontransaction revenue increased 7%, primarily due to growth in fees associated with Surveillance and growth in CRISIL revenue. Transaction revenue decreased 31% on the soft issuance already discussed.\nThis slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 21% decrease in Corporates and a 12% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by Structured Credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 9%, Governments decreased 11% and the CRISIL and Other category increased 12%.\nAnd now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 14%. The return of in-person conferences, most notably CERAWeek and World Petrochemical Conference, drove 70% year-over-year growth in advisory and transactional services revenue. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, revenue growth would have been 8% year-over-year.\nGlobal Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 17%, mainly due to strong fuel oil and iron ore volumes. As Doug noted earlier, GTS revenue often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile, which we certainly witnessed in the first quarter.\nExpenses increased 18%, primarily due to cost associated with the return of in-person conferences and headcount and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expenses would have increased 10% year-over-year.\nSegment operating profit increased 8%, and the segment operating profit margin decreased 210 basis points to 43%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 43%.\nIn addition to the exceptional quarter in Advisory & Transactional Services, we saw strong demand driving growth in Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in Upstream Data & Insights, though we note positive signs of inflection in the Upstream business.\nBut for the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Upstream would have had its second consecutive quarter of positive ACV growth, which is a leading indicator for revenue. We also saw a dramatic improvement in retention in the Upstream business as retention rates improved by more than 10 full percentage points over the last 12 months.\nIn our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in Planning Solutions and Used Car offerings. Expenses grew 11% on increased advertising expense in the quarter and headcount growth in 2021 as the business restores capacity to better align with strong growth over the past 18 months.\nThis resulted in an 8% growth in adjusted operating profit and 80 basis points of margin contraction year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 400 basis points to 39%.\nDealer revenue increased to 12% year-over-year, benefiting from successful prior-year-period promotions and from retention rates that remain above pre-COVID levels. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year related to the well-publicized supply chain challenges faced by automotive OEMs. Financials and Other increased 12%, driven primarily by strength in our insurance underwriting products.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices delivered strong revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. During the quarter, expenses increased 9%, largely due to strategic investments, increased compensation and IT costs.\nSegment operating profit increased 16%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 69.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points to 68%.\nEvery category increased revenue this quarter. Asset-Linked Fees increased 15%, primarily from AUM-driven gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance. Exchange-Traded Derivative revenue increased 22% on increased trading volumes. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 4%.\nOver the past year, ETF net inflows were $286 billion, and market appreciation totaled $244 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.9 trillion, which is 22% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 24% year-over-year. Sequentially, versus the end of the fourth quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $68 billion, and market depreciation totaled $123 billion.\nWithin our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 7% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in nonsubscription offerings, most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Investment in growth initiatives and an increase in royalty expense led to a 5% increase in adjusted expenses. This resulted in segment operating profit growth of 17% and 160 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 20%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 3% year-over-year, while nonsubscription revenue increased 60% over the same period.\nNow moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance, and this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low single-digit increase year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses.\nWe now expect corporate unallocated expense between $85 million and $95 million, approximately $30 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecast incentive compensation and professional fees. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, down $10 million from prior guidance. This is due to a slightly lower average cost of debt than we initially expected.\nWe expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items, in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. There is no change to our expectations for deal-related amortization, operating profit margin expansion or tax rate.\nThis slide illustrates our guidance by division. For Ratings, we now expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits and for margins to be in the low to mid-60s. This compares to previous guidance calling for low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-60s. Our outlook for Other segments is unchanged from previous guidance.\nOverall, we are incredibly encouraged by the team's ability to execute so well even in the current macro environment. We're focused on the enormous long-term opportunity ahead of us as a combined company, and we are more confident than ever in our ability to execute against that opportunity. Our differentiated data, insights, analytics and services help our customers to thrive and accelerate progress.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\n\nMark Grant\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Ewout. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we'll now take our first question."

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\n\nRobert Merritt\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you for joining today's S&P Global Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.\nBefore we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn addition, as announced late in 2020, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March last year, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we currently expect to close this quarter.\nThis call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute and offer a sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus meeting requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.\nIn connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement and prospectus, which are available on our website and sec.gov.\nIn today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management.\nThe earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website.\nI would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.\nWe're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at (212) 438-2296.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\n\nDouglas L. Peterson\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Chip. Welcome to everyone joining today's earnings call. The first thing I'd like to do is thank our people at S&P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2021. We've asked a lot of our people this year as they do their day jobs while also preparing for the expected merger with IHS Markit and all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the pandemic. So on behalf of the Board and our management team, thank you.\nNow let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2021. S&P Global delivered 12% organic revenue growth and 17% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All 4 businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin. This is quite an achievement following the remarkable results of 2020.\nWe generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items, and returned $743 million in dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. Clearly, the most important initiative of the year has been on preparation for the merger and the multiple rounds of synergy validation. Upon closing of the merger, we are well prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you.\nIn fact, on a run rate basis, we have already achieved prerealized synergies of $25 million by the end of 2021. Also, after the merger is completed, we will host a post-merger investor call to provide an update on the merged company strategy, business segment details, synergies, investment programs, share repurchase plans and guidance.\nThe other key initiatives achieved in 2021 include the rapid progress achieved on our 2020 multiyear productivity program; numerous new product launches and expanded product capabilities resulting from our strategic investment initiatives; the creation of Sustainable1 to manage and drive significant expansion in coordination with ESG product offerings across the company; the launch of S&P Platts Dimensions Pro, a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing, market commentary, news and analytics with special emphasis on energy transition; and continued progress in China with one example being the issuance of 57 domestic ratings in China, up over 150% from 2020. This included the first dual-rated bond. I'll provide more detail on many of these items in today's call.\nThese are the strategic initiatives that we shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call last year. We made great strides in each of these items, and we'll remark in more detail on many of them today.\nTo recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 12% to $8.3 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 15%. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 55.2%. And we delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. It's important to note that adjusted EPS of $13.70 far exceeded our original 2021 guidance of $12.25 to $12.45 and that the adjusted operating profit margin of 55.2% far exceeded our original guidance of 53.8% to 54.3%. Much of this was due to unexpected outperformance in Ratings following what was a very strong 2020. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment.\nAll 4 divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. The largest revenue gain was the 16% in Indices. After several years of elevated investment spending, Market Intelligence delivered the largest adjusted operating profit margin increase with a gain of 190 basis points.\nIt's important to remember that our 2021 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we've posted a compound annual growth rate of 8% for revenue, and we have averaged 217 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that time frame.\nThe company also continued to advance its own industry-leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 10th Annual Sustainability Impact Report and third Annual TCFD Report. We expanded parental leave to 26 weeks and introduced a flexible time-off policy with no prescribed maximum in all eligible jurisdictions.\nWe established a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility tied to our published Science Based Target goals, one of the first sustainability-linked banking facilities in the U.S. Our S&P Global Foundation increased its grants by 30% to $15 million to organizations that support COVID-19 relief, diversity, economic inclusion and environmental sustainability. And our efforts have been recognized by several leading third parties.\nWhile we continue to improve our own internal sustainability programs, we're investing in our ESG business. In 2021, we launched Sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external ESG efforts across the company. This resulted in ESG revenue of $98 million, a 51% increase over 2020. All our key ESG products contributed to this growth.\nWe completed 59 ESG Evaluations, up 48%; 43 Green Evaluations, up 79%; 103 SAM benchmark engagements, up 36%; and we launched social and sustainability framework alignment opinions and completed 42 of them. We ended 2021 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $32.2 billion, an increase of 59% versus year-end 2020.\nAt the core of our ESG efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. These are a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology year that ends in March, we have already increased CSA survey participation by 58% to 2,190 companies.\nWe also enhanced ESG offerings available on Capital IQ Pro, expanded S&P Global ESG scores coverage to 11,500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines, power stations and buildings. In addition to excellent commercial progress and expanded capabilities, we also launched numerous new ESG products and initiatives in 2021.\nWhile I don't have time to delve into each one of them, let me just comment on a few. Second Party Opinions assess a transaction against a sustainable finance framework for alignment with consistent and comparable market principles and standards. Climate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments and portfolios.\nTo support these efforts, Market Intelligence and Oliver Wyman created Climate Credit Analytics, a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite. And in December, we acquired the Climate Service. The company sells the Climanomics platform, a tool that quantifies physical climate risk for corporates, investors and governments.\nKensho continues to be a driving force for productivity improvement for the company and increasingly for our customers. The key capabilities they have created are listed on this slide. Codex is an AI-powered document viewer that enables efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from large quantities of documents. There have been over 300,000 client uses to date. Codex is available on Capital IQ Pro.\nKensho AGAVE has transformed Platts' process for creating price assessments. The AGAVE tool, developed by engineers at Kensho and Platts, has transformed the process for creating price assessments. Platts has implemented AGAVE in 40 of 57 markets targeted. And on average, daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster.\nInternally, Kensho Link facilitated quicker data ingestion by providing automated mappings for 60 million company entities. Externally, Kensho Link was used by our customers to efficiently map 16 million of their own entities to S&P Global unique identifiers.\nMany of our customers have taken note of Kensho's capabilities. And we've begun monetizing Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, RPA, data extraction and machine learning development. While the innovation we create internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. One of those is the shift into passive investing.\nThis chart illustrates the $1.9 trillion of cumulative AUM U.S. equity flows in the past 10 years. We are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been a 173% increase over the past 5 years to $2.8 trillion. We believe that this trend will continue.\nThe increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. It's hard to believe that 2021 issuance growth of 15% exceeded 2020 issuance growth of 13% as is often the case, to pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. In 2020, global investment grade and high yield were the strongest, while in 2021, leveraged loans and structured products were the fastest-growing categories.\nThe market clearly favored leveraged loans over high yield in 2021. The bars on these charts depict leverage loan volume, which soared in 2021. The lines depict the percentage of loans that we rated, which reached new heights of 95% in the U.S. and 93% in Europe.\nI'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2022. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11 trillion over the next 5 years. This is down 3% from the $11.3 trillion highlighted in last year's study.\nThe chart on the right depicts the global high-yield debt and leverage loans maturing over the next 5 years. It totals $2.9 trillion, down 3% from $3 trillion in last year's study. It appears that 2021 issuance benefited from a bit of extra pull forward.\nLet's put this small decline in upcoming maturities into perspective. This chart shows total global corporate debt outstanding for the past 6 years. This increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. The vast majority of this debt will get refinanced, and the pool of debt that needs to be refinanced just keeps getting larger.\nAfter exceptional issuance growth in 2020 and 2021, our Ratings research group anticipates that issuance will decrease 2% in 2022. The forecast calls for gains in structured, U.S. municipal and financial services issuance of 3%, 2% and 1%, respectively, and a decrease in nonfinancials of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast, and it does not include leveraged loans.\nNow let's start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022. The global economy is in the midst of a robust but uneven rebound from the pandemic. Demand growth is outrunning supply growth, and inflation has risen quickly almost everywhere.\nGDP growth in the U.S. and Europe reached multi-decade highs in 2021 and have continued in 2022. Inflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the U.S. and Europe. Our economists now expect at least 3 Fed rate hikes this year starting in March.\nEach year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2022. Probably the most important positive factors are the expectation for continued healthy economic growth, borrowing costs that remain historically low, continued AUM flows from active to passive, elevated commodity levels that help the financial stability of commodity producers and ample liquidity.\nThe most significant negative factors are geopolitical uncertainty, sticky inflation, Central Bank rate increases and a repricing of equities. And of course, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions remain general risks facing the global economy.\nBefore I finish, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global. We're hopeful we'll be speaking with you soon to update you on the merger. Once the merger is complete, we will immediately begin building a new company with an even brighter future.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug, and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 12%. Adjusted corporate unallocated expense increased 38% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, higher professional fees and the timing of contributions to the S&P Global Foundation. Adjusted total expenses increased 9%, and I'll come back to this on the next slide.\nAdjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points. Interest expense decreased 22% primarily due to a reduction in FIN 48 interest expense accruals, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 16%.\nTotal adjusted expenses for the full year increased 7%. For the fourth quarter, they increased 9%. The fourth quarter increase was primarily due to elevated variable expenses, including incentives, commissions and royalties as a result of strong 2021 financial performance; severance charges related to management changes in the Indices business during the quarter; increased investments in growth initiatives; increased professional fees; and the resumption of T&E spending.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments totaled to a net pretax loss of $131 million. They included $21 million for merger transaction costs primarily legal fees; $42 million for merger integration costs primarily consulting fees, retention bonuses, branding and technology integration costs; $51 million for merger costs to achieve, which will drive synergy benefits, they include lease impairments and restructuring charges; $4 million for acquisition and divestiture-related expenses; $8 million in gains from real estate sales; and $21 million in deal-related amortization.\nThis quarter, all 4 segments delivered increased revenue with Indices leading the way with an 18% increase. All 4 segments also delivered adjusted operating profit growth with Ratings leading the way with an 18% increase. Quarterly margins were mixed, but more importantly, all 4 segments reported a gain in adjusted operating profit margin for the year.\nEach year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share the changes in our headcount. In 2021, headcount decreased 1% primarily for 2 reasons. The first is operational efficiencies. Much of the operational efficiencies were from automation. In fact, our people created 225 bots in 2021 with Market Intelligence leading the way with 167 bots. Cognitive automation and RPA generated over 600,000 hours of savings in 2021.\nThe second is prerealized merger synergies. Because of the pending merger, it didn't make sense to backfill many positions when people left the company in 2021. We estimate that there were about 150 S&P Global positions left unfilled, representing prerealized synergies of approximately $25 million by year-end 2021.\nThis year, with the formation of Sustainable1, we added this as a new category. Many of the people in Sustainable1 were previously reported in other categories. Platts was the area with the largest headcount increase at 11% due to investments in several growth projects. Market Intelligence had the largest decrease at 6% largely due to automation efficiencies and realignment to Sustainable1.\nLast year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $100 million on growth initiatives in 2021. We ended up investing $80 million. The primary reasons for the difference were the competing priorities due to the merger and the competitive labor market. We will share our 2022 investment spending plans after the merger is completed.\nOn our third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over a 2- to 3-year period. I'm pleased to report that only after 18 months, we have already largely completed the program. There are a few small procurement projects that are awaiting the close of the merger to take advantage of the increased scale of the combined company. All our productivity efforts will now be focused on achieving the merger synergies.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.\nFree cash flow, excluding certain items, was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $217 million or 7% over the prior year period. Because the share repurchase program was suspended due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, we only returned 21% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2021. After the merger is completed, we expect to significantly ramp up share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to the division results, starting with S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 18% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and increased exchange-rated derivative activity. Our asset-linked revenue also included the benefit of a customer underreporting true-up.\nIn the fourth quarter, we reported a 28% increase in adjusted expenses primarily due to severance, increased incentive compensation, commissions and royalties, a 13% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65.7%, a decrease of 280 basis points. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 69.9%.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 18% with very strong gains in ETFs and mutual funds. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 30%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 10%.\nActivity at the CBOE increased in the fourth quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 47% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18%. CME equity complex volume increased 15% with particular strength in E-mini S&P 500 options.\nRatings reported revenue increased 12%. Adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, wages and outside services. This resulted in an 18% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin.\nOn a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 64.2%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to fees associated with CRISIL, new entity credit ratings and surveillance, partly offset by lower Rating Evaluation Service. As an aside, we added over 1,000 new entity credit ratings in 2021. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment-grade corporate bonds, bank loans and structured products.\nThis slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 14% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 5%, structured finance increased 32%, governments decreased 11%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%.\nOn the right side of this slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CLOs, which increased 43%.\nTurning to Platts. Revenue increased 12% or $26 million, including a $4 million commercial settlement. Approximately 14% of this growth was from new products. Core subscriptions increased 10%, and Global Trading Services increased 13%. The gains in GTS revenue were mainly from higher petroleum and iron ore volumes.\nAdjusted expenses increased 16% primarily due to increased commissions, growth investments, cost of sales and incentives. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50.1%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 55.1%. Platts delivered excellent revenue growth in every category with notable increases in natural gas, power and renewables and petrochemicals.\nMarket Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8% or $42 million, with 34% of the growth coming from new products. Usage of our key market platforms increased 4% year-over-year, while year-ending active users increased 13% to 299,000 users.\nAdjusted expenses increased 5% due to increased cloud hosting initiatives, royalties, incentives and commissions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 32.7%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34.3%.\nLooking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 6%. During 2021, Market Intelligence rebranded its premier platform offering as Capital IQ Pro. The Capital IQ Pro platform combines the best of Capital IQ and SNL desktops with broad public fundamentals and deep industry data. In addition, the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets as well as regulatory, supply chain, climate data and analytics and ESG scores.\nData Management Solutions revenue grew 11%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Due to the pending merger, the company will not provide guidance for 2022 at this time but will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed. We continue to expect the merger to close this quarter. In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there are additional slides in an appendix that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentations section of the Investor Relations website.\nIn conclusion, 2021 was a noteworthy year for S&P Global. We delivered strong financial results, realized significant growth, made considerable progress on merger preparation and synergy validation and launched multiple innovative new products across the company, including our Sustainable1 product offerings.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.\n\nRobert Merritt\n\nSVP of IR, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van Der Ghinst\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Justin Picicci, Chief Financial Officer.

Our reported results, including foreign currency, can be found in this morning's press release.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. More than 8 years ago, we embarked on an ambitious journey of elevation across our brand, our products and our go-to-market strategy around the world. Led by Ralph's vision of inspiring the dream of a better life, we put our consumers at the center. And we put this company on the path of healthier, more consistent more sustainable, long-term growth and value creation.\nIn September, we were proud to introduce the latest iteration of this journey, which we are calling our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan. We outlined the vast opportunities still ahead for Ralph Lauren. We currently play in a total addressable premium and luxury market worth $400 billion. And we are just over $7 billion today, less than a 2% market share. Our strategy to grow our share and deliver long-term sustainable growth over the next 2 years and well beyond continues to be supported by multiple diversified engines. As a reminder, these include: First, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.\nWe are off to a strong start in the execution of this plan, with second quarter performance outpacing our expectations across the top and bottom line. These results underscore our diversity of growth opportunities and the broad-based momentum of our iconic brand, which is resonating across generations, cultures and geographies.\nAll 3 regions contributed to growth this quarter, including double-digit increases in retail comps and global wholesale sales. And we achieved this while continuing to elevate our brand and drive higher quality of sales. Our strong performance through the first half of this fiscal year also gives us confidence to take up our full year guidance once again, even as we remain relatively cautious on the second half of the year due to potential consumer headwinds and general volatility. While we are watching the macro environment closely, we remain well positioned to capture market share opportunities across categories and geographies. And we are firmly on offense with a focus on investing behind our brands, products and key city ecosystems to deliver growth for the long term.\nLet me walk you through a few highlights from the quarter, where we drove progress across our 3 long-term strategic pillars. Starting with our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. As many of you heard in September, Ralph Lauren has the most loyal customers in our defined premium and luxury market. Sitting at the heart of culture, we build relationships for life, independent of any single fashion trend or cycle. And by leaning into our inclusive luxury lifestyle positioning, we are engaging with consumers across the many facets of their lives, from the runway, to the biggest stages in sports, music, gaming and more. And all in a way that is authentic to the core values we've embraced for 58 years: Optimism, quality, authenticity, timelessness and the easy elegance of a life well lived.\nOur teams delivered a powerful range of brand activations this quarter, as we successfully lapped last year's outstanding Paris Summer Olympics. Key highlights included: first, we continue to reinforce our position as one of the leading luxury apparel brands in the world of sports. We celebrated our 20th year as the official sponsor of both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open tennis championships this summer. Our Wimbledon storytelling combine the elegance and cherished traditions of British heritage with Ralph Lauren's refine spectator style. Our U.S. Open campaign paid homage to the most electric main stage in tennis to our colorful retro-inspired collection, delivering record-breaking sales around the event. And as sponsor of the U.S. team, we welcomed the Ryder Cup to [ Beth page ] for the first time this fall.\nAmong our many activations, we took over part of Rockefeller Center Plaza and drove storytelling on social media with Nick Jonas and brand ambassador, Billy Horschel. Together, these sports lifestyle campaigns embodied both the proud tradition of sport and the progressive spirit that propels it forward. They drove a combined 67 billion global impressions and more than $350 million in media value.\nNext, we hosted our Spring '26 Women's Collection fashion show here in New York City, showcasing a balance of strength and centrality in a modern palette of black, white and crimson. And beyond the runway, we delivered some of the most iconic celebrity moments of the season, from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce choosing Ralph Lauren for their viral engagement, to the old Hollywood glamor of Selena Gomez's wedding to Benny Blanco.\nOur activations are also driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and retention. In the second quarter, we added 1.5 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, a mid-single-digit increase to last year, driven by digital and full-price store customers. The ongoing momentum this quarter was led by luxury buyers and with balanced growth across men, women and younger cohorts. And we increased our social media followers by high single digits to 67 million, led by Instagram, TikTok, Douyin and LINE. This rolling thunder approach to activations, enabled by our strong data and analytics capabilities, gives us confidence to continue our brand momentum as we look ahead.\nMoving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Ralph's vision has always been about more than a tie or a polo shirt or a sweater. The heart of what we do is storytelling through our clothes and experiences through the cinematic worlds that Ralph has created. And our unique approach to styling enables customers to step into these worlds to build the wardrobes that tell the story of their lives, from that first red polo shirt in a school picture, to the striped silk polo dress in an engagement photo. This philosophy is embedded in how we drive our core products, as much as it is in our high potential and complementary lifestyle categories.\nStarting with our core, which represents more than 70% of our business. Core product sales grew mid-teens this quarter, driven by strength in cotton, [ cable knit ], wool, cashmere and cotton [ shaker ] sweaters, linen and seasonal Oxford shirts, our lightweight jackets and our Icon Polo Chino caps. An exciting back-to-school season also drove growth and share gains in our core children's programs, led by cable-knit sweaters, quilted jackets and Oxford shirts. Our high-potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags, continue to be accelerators for our business. Together, these categories increased strong double digits, outpacing total company growth in the quarter.\nWomen's apparel continued to be driven by our foundational core, along with a strong response to our seasonal styles. Highlights included our cable knit jersey and featherweight cashmere sweaters, linen shirts, our transitional city and utility barn jackets and dresses. Momentum in our handbag business continued this quarter, driven by each of our women's labels and led by our foundational Polo ID collection; Polo Play, which launched this past spring and included exciting pop-up shops in Korea this quarter; our women's collection Ralph bags in seasonal region green leather and mocha suede, and an encouraging launch for our [ Tasha Collection ], an elevated new offering in the Lauren family of handbags.\nSpecial releases this quarter included our limited edition Polo Ralph Lauren for Oak Bluffs Collection, in partnership with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges, a powerful celebration honoring the legacy of Oak Bluffs as a cultural haven for black communities in Martha's Vineyard. Our capsules for Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and Ryder Cup, with strong double-digit comp growth in each collection, led by our Polo Bear and Free Styles. And our newest Ralph's Club New York fragrance launch featuring Usher. We will continue to leverage the unparalleled breadth of our lifestyle product offering and power of our icons as consumer lifestyles evolve.\nTurning to our third key initiative, Win in Key Cities with our Consumer Ecosystem. We continue to thoughtfully expand our consumer ecosystems to deepen Ralph Lauren's presence in our top 30 cities around the world, delivering a cohesive, elevated brand experience across each of our channels. At the same time, we've started investing in our next 20 cities, laying the groundwork for long-term sustainable growth. Within DTC, which comprises the majority of our business, we delivered another strong quarter of comp growth across regions. Global comps increased 13%, above our expectations, with double-digit growth in both our digital sites and physical stores. All 3 regions outperformed our expectations again in the second quarter with double-digit growth in every geography, including North America.\nAsia once again led our growth, with sales up mid-teens, driven by all key markets. China grew more than 30% in the quarter, ahead of our outlook with a strong consumer response to our brand building activities, including our Summer of Sports campaigns and amplification of our New York Fashion Show. As we continue to reinforce our presence in our top cities, we opened 38 new owned and partner stores globally. And we recently announced that we are opening our sixth restaurant, bringing our iconic Polo Bar experience to London. The opening is slated for 2028. And yes, we're already getting requests for tables.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continues to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Recent highlights include: first, as part of our focus on delivering advanced technology, AI and analytics. In September, we launched our new AI styling tool, Ask Ralph, that we developed with Microsoft. Bringing Ralph's iconic styling right to your pocket, Ask Ralph builds on our history of innovating the consumer shopping experience and immersing our consumers in the world of Ralph Lauren with cutting-edge technology. While still early, customer engagement and feedback have been encouraging. And this is an exciting step forward in our journey to test and learn new tools to better serve our consumers, drive conversion and ultimately build lifetime value.\nSecond, our teams and our culture drive our performance. We were proud to be named one of America's Best Employers for Company Culture by Forbes. And finally, Ralph Lauren was honored in Fast Company's 2025 Innovation by Design Awards for our unforgettable brand presence at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. We look forward to building on this legacy, bringing our heritage of sport and style to life at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics in February.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are incredibly proud and grateful for the hard work, care and dedication that our teams are delivering around the world. Together, we are building on Ralph's legacy and vision with this next great chapter of growth. We remain focused on creating value through a distinct brand position that's clear, consistent, relevant and emotionally resonant. And a legacy of leadership in fashion, in culture and in innovation and a proven ability to execute with creativity, agility and operating discipline, all underpinned by our fortress balance sheet and ongoing commitment to embrace new technology and support our teams, partners and communities.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Justin, and I'll join him at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJustin Picicci\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate strong progress as we embark on our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan, showcasing our team's agility and unwavering focus on execution.\nTop line performance exceeded our expectations, reaching our highest Q2 revenues since we began our elevation journey more than 8 years ago. Results were driven by broad-based performance across every region and channel, highlighting our brand strength and authentic connection with consumers around the world. Gross and operating margins once again outperformed our outlook as we continue to elevate across all markets. Each of our 3 regions contributed to operating margin expansion despite the volatile global operating environment. And we achieved all of this while continuing to invest behind our strategic drivers of long-term growth. As Patrice mentioned, our strong year-to-date results and brand momentum give us confidence to raise our full year outlook, even as we maintain a relatively cautious stance into the second half, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and exceptionally strong prior year compares.\nBut first, let me walk you through our financial highlights from the second quarter, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company second quarter revenue growth of 14% was above our high single-digit outlook. By region, Asia and Europe led our performance, with sales increasing 16% and 15%, respectively, followed closely by North America, up 13%. Total company retail comps increased 13%, with ongoing momentum in both our own digital business and stores. Total digital ecosystem sales, including our own sites and wholesale digital accounts, grew double digits, reflecting balanced growth across regions.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points to 67.7%. The increase was driven by AUR growth, favorable mix shift toward our full-price businesses and lower cotton costs, which more than offset tariffs, labor and non-cotton material costs. AUR increased 12% in the second quarter, supported by strong full price selling trends, reduced discounting, modest targeted pricing growth and favorable product mix. We currently expect high single-digit AUR growth for the second half of fiscal '26, based on similar drivers.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 11%, reflecting a 130 basis point decline as a percentage of sales to last year. We delivered leverage across key expense categories, including rent, marketing and selling on better-than-expected sales. Second quarter marketing investments grew 2% to last year. As a percentage of sales, marketing normalized at 7.8% compared to last year's 8.7%, which included our Paris Olympic activations. We now expect marketing as a percentage of sales to be approximately 7.5% in fiscal '26, in line with our long-range plan. Second quarter adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 13.5%, with adjusted operating income increasing 34%.\nMoving to segment performance, and starting with North America. Second quarter revenue increased 13%, above our expectations, with balanced growth across our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses. In North America retail, second quarter comps were up 13%, led once again by our Ralph Lauren stores. Digital comps grew 15%, supported by our strategy of full funnel activations, which drove higher quality of sales. In North America wholesale, revenue also increased 13%, driven by strong performance in digital wholesale and our top premium and luxury doors, as well as stronger-than-expected replenishment.\nWe are encouraged by our recent sellout trends, but maintain a more measured outlook for the second half of fiscal '26 based on further strategic reductions in off-price sales in the fourth quarter and potential near-term macro pressures across the broader channel. We still plan to exit 90 to 100 wholesale doors in fiscal '26, with approximately half of these related to Hudson's Bay.\nMoving to Europe. Second quarter revenue increased 15%, exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by continued momentum across both our retail and wholesale channels. All key markets delivered growth in the quarter, reflecting our ongoing brand strength and elevation. Europe retail comps increased 10% to last year, with strong performance across stores and digital channels. Our Europe digital ecosystem increased double digits, driven by both our wholesale and owned digital businesses. Europe wholesale increased 18%, driven by higher-than-expected reorders and a planned shift in shipments into the first half of the fiscal year, as we previously discussed. The timing shift represented approximately 11 points of the wholesale increase in Q2, with the channel still reflecting healthy underlying growth.\nTurning to Asia. Second quarter revenue and retail comps each grew 16%, with every key market contributing to growth. China once again led our performance, with sales increasing more than 30% to last year, driven by robust comps and new customer recruitment, enabling our continued outperformance versus peers in the market. Sales in Japan increased high single digits, driven by strong full price selling and reduced discounting.\nBuilding out our digital presence remains a significant long-term opportunity across Asia. We are encouraged by our early progress, including double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We drove meaningful acceleration on our Japan digital site, supported by the recent transition to our global e-commerce operating system. And in China, we continue to expand our presence on Douyin since launching our Women's Shop earlier in 2025, including our first Wimbledon live stream digital event this quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation continue to be powerful enablers of our long-term strategy, supporting both our strategic growth investments and our commitment to shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we finalized the purchase of our Newbury Street store in Boston and also retired our $400 million in senior notes, which matured in September. In addition to our regular dividend, we have repurchased $313 million in shares this fiscal year-to-date, returning a combined total of approximately $420 million to shareholders. We ended the period with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 billion in total debt.\nNet inventory moderated from Q1 levels as planned, increasing 12% to last year, roughly in line with revenue growth. Our inventories are well positioned to meet consumer demand in each of our regions for the holiday season. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current operating environment, geopolitical backdrop and macroeconomic trends. This includes tariffs and other inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and foreign currency fluctuations, among other considerations.\nFor fiscal '26, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase in a range of approximately 5% to 7%, up from low to mid-single digits previously. This is slightly ahead of the 3-year guidance we provided in September for year 1 of our long-range plan. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit revenue growth by about 200 to 250 basis points this year. The increased outlook reflects our better-than-expected performance in the first 2 quarters of the year, as well as our continued brand momentum into fall/holiday despite the challenging compares.\nWith our strong first half results, we now expect North America revenues to be up slightly for the full year versus our prior outlook of a low single-digit decline. We continue to expect Q4 to be the weakest quarter of the year for North America based on our caution around cost inflation related pressures on U.S. consumers, in addition to our planned strategic reductions in off-price wholesale. We expect Europe to grow at the high end of mid-single digits, unchanged from our previous guide, with the first half benefiting from planned wholesale timing shifts, followed by a sequential deceleration due to challenging second half compares. Despite the timing shifts, we still expect healthy underlying growth in Europe, in line with our long-term plan. And we now expect Asia to be up high single to low double digits for both the second half and the full year, up from high single digits previously.\nOperating margin is now expected to expand approximately 60 to 80 basis points in constant currency, up from our prior guidance of 40 to 60 basis points, primarily driven by expense leverage. We now anticipate constant currency gross margin to expand about 10 to 30 basis points for the full year, with further growth in AUR, favorable cotton costs and geographic mix more than offsetting pressure from tariffs. Foreign currency is expected to benefit gross and operating margins by about 30 to 50 basis points in fiscal '26.\nFollowing our strategic pull forward of receipts, we continue to expect tariff headwinds to ramp up in our fiscal Q3 and become more pronounced into Q4. As a result, we still expect a notable year-over-year gross margin decline in Q4 due to the combination of reciprocal tariffs, unusually strong prior year compares and previously discussed timing shifts, all negatively impacting our smallest revenue quarter of the year. We remain confident in our long-term gross margin outlook of 50 to 100 basis points of expansion over the 3 years of our Drive plan, with expansion expected in each year.\nWhile we anticipate gross margin pressure over the next few quarters, Q4 of this fiscal year is still expected to be the most negatively impacted quarter, driven by the additional timing-related headwinds. As we move through next fiscal year, we expect to mitigate these pressures more meaningfully as we begin to lap the tariffs and our sourcing shifts and other mitigating actions take effect more broadly. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately mid-single digits, reflecting a slightly improved outlook for the back half of the year versus our expectations in August and coming into the year. Foreign currency is expected to benefit revenues by approximately 150 to 200 basis points. We expect third quarter operating margin to expand approximately 60 to 80 basis points in constant currency. This is driven by 50 to 70 basis points of gross margin expansion, as well as slight operating expense leverage, more than offsetting tariffs and higher marketing investments to support our global holiday activations and Polo Women's fashion presentation in Paris. Foreign currency is expected to benefit gross and operating margins by about 10 and 20 basis points, respectively, in the third quarter. We expect our third quarter tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23% and a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 21%.\nIn closing, we are proud of our team's strong execution and early progress on our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan across the world through the first half of this fiscal year. Even in an operating environment that remains dynamic, our agility, fortress balance sheet, culture of operating discipline and multiple engines of growth give us confidence in our ability to continue delivering sustainable long-term value. As we shape the future of inclusive luxury lifestyle, we remain focused on investing in the key strategic priorities that will enable us to connect with the consumers more broadly and deeply than ever before and to continue inspiring them to dream.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are encouraged by our strong start to the fiscal year with first quarter results that exceeded our expectations across the top and bottom line. In the midst of a highly dynamic global operating environment, our growing brand desirability, diversified drivers of growth and muscles of organizational agility and executional excellence are standouts as we continue to deliver on our long-term strategic priorities. This quarter's performance underscores the power of our iconic brand, with a unique ability to reach across geographies, cultures, genders and generations of consumers, the breadth and appeal of our lifestyle portfolio of products with timelessness, value and quality more relevant than ever and our proven key city ecosystem model as we continue to expand and elevate across every consumer touch point to be even more personal, more engaging and more digitally connected.\nOur strong first quarter results were once again broad-based, driven by every geography and channel. We delivered double-digit top line growth in both Asia and Europe and high single-digit growth in North America with global comps up 13%. This exceeded the expectations we laid out in May, even as we chose to reinvest back into our marketing, digital and ecosystem initiatives and return cash to our shareholders. This strong early performance gives us confidence to take up our full year guidance even as we remain cautious on the second half of the year due to potential tariff-related pressures on broader consumer behavior. Despite macro headwinds, we remain well positioned, and we are on offense based on our continued commitment to invest behind our brands and market share gains, our strong growing geographical presence largely concentrated in our key cities in each region and our relentless focus on improving technology, AI and analytics to better serve our consumers and drive greater efficiencies in our business. All underscored by our balance sheet and operating discipline.\nLet me review a few highlights from the quarter where we drove continued progress across our 3 long-term strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Starting with our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. The Ralph Lauren brand remains one of our most powerful assets sitting at the epicenter of culture and inspiring people all over the world to step into their dreams. And this dream of a better life remains as relevant to consumers today as it was when Ralph Lauren as a company nearly 60 years ago.\nAs we expand our business across geographies, categories and channels, our teams are tapping into the power of our brand across a diversity of marketing platforms to reach our target consumers across generations. Some highlights from the first quarter included: first, we can enforce our luxury lifestyle positioning through major activations focused on our top cities. In April, we hosted our first-ever fashion presentation in China with our Shanghai Re-See event, which translated our Spring '25 Hamptons Fashion Show to an all-Asian cast and star studied event. This was coupled with an innovative live shopping event on Douyin and 360-degree takeover across our stores, outdoor and digital media.\nIn addition to delivering a new record high for our China Q1 sales, the campaign drove over $64 billion impressions with strong customer acquisition. This was followed by our Fall '25 Modern Romantics Women's Collection Fashion Show here in New York City, showcasing the easy elegance of relaxed tailoring with meticulous attention to detail and materials. And in June, we hosted our Spring '26 Men's Purple Label show in Milan, marrying timeless craftsmanship and sophistication with the spirit of adventure. Beyond the runway, we delivered iconic celebrity moments, from dressing Beyonce in Cowboy Carter World Tour to Usher and Tyson Backford wearing custom Purple label looks at the Met Gala.\nAnd most recently, we reinforced our leadership in the world of sports, with another successful Wimbledon sponsorship, where we drove the highest media value across all brands present and 43 billion global PR impressions, a more than 40% increase to last year. These activities are driving strong, sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. In the first quarter, we added 1.4 million new customers to our DTC businesses, a mid-single-digit increase to last year, driven by digital and full-price store customers and continuing to skew more toward women, luxury and next-generation younger cohorts. And we increased our social media followers by high single digits to nearly $66 million led by Instagram, LINE, Douyin and TikTok.\nMoving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Ralph and our design teams continue to create beautiful products that serve our customers' modern lifestyles, all while staying true to what we stand for, authenticity, quality, and sophisticated timeless style. This is more important than ever as consumers look to brands and styles that they know and trust that will last and deliver a compelling value proposition. Our growing value perception, together with our strong pricing power, gives us confidence in our ability to continue on our elevation journey. This begins with our core products which represent more than 70% of our business. Our core remains an important differentiator in an industry that is typically more reliant on fluctuating fashion trends.\nCore product sales grew mid-teens this quarter, driven by strength in seasonal sweater polos, cotton cable net and marino sweaters, lightweight outerwear, including our [ beta ] jackets in our [ BuySwing and Bayport ] windbreakers, our newer linen offerings and caps. Our special capsules this quarter centered on our sporting lifestyle, including our Candy Shop Yankees Baseball Collection for opening day and another elegant installment of Wimbledon pieces. Our high-potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags, continue to be accelerators for our business. Together, these categories increased strong double digits outpacing total company growth in the quarter.\nWomen's apparel continued to be driven by our foundational core along with a strong response to our seasonal styles. Highlights included our cable net jersey and polo bear sweaters, linen shirts, dresses, our Cotton Canvas City jacket and our newest foundational handbag collection, Polo Play, which launched earlier this spring. Within our complementary lifestyle categories, we unveiled our latest home collection Canyon Road at Salone del Mobile in Milan this spring, inspired by the raw natural beauty of the American West, the collection reinforces our position in luxury living.\nTurning to our third key initiative, winning key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We continue to expand and invest disproportionately in our key city ecosystems delivering a cohesive, elevated brand experience across each of our consumer channels around the world. Within DTC, which comprises the majority of our business, we delivered another quarter of strong comp growth across regions. Comps increased 13%. This was above our expectations with double-digit growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. Globally, we opened 24 new owned and partner stores this quarter, including our first Ralph Lauren store in Vancouver, now our second location in Canada following our Toronto launch in 2023, a Purple Label and RRL shop in Shinsegae Centum City department store marking the debut of our luxury brands in the Korean market and our newest candy shop concept in the luxury resort destination of [ Marbea ], reinforcing our presence in the Spanish market.\nAll 3 regions outperformed our expectations again in the first quarter, led by international. Asia was particularly strong, accelerating to high teens growth driven by both China and Japan. China grew more than 30% in the quarter, outpacing our competitive set with a strong consumer response to our brand-building initiatives including our April fashion show in Shanghai. And North America maintained healthy trends up high single digits with strength across DTC channels and stabilization in wholesale as planned.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Some highlights include: First, as part of our focus on delivering best-in-class digital technology and analytics and following our successful predictive buying pilot over the past year in Asia and Europe, we will continue to expand this AI-driven program to additional core styles in fiscal '26, enabling better chase and in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive both sales and inventory efficiencies.\nSecond, as part of our multiyear next-generation transformation project, we were excited to launch automation in our European distribution center this quarter. We will roll out new automation capabilities to our other regions over the course of this fiscal year, enabling greater supply chain efficiency and savings and ultimately, better demand fulfillment for our consumers as we get product to the right place at the right time. We were also proud to be recently named one of America's best employers for women by Forbes. And finally, this June, Ralph received the Fragrance Foundation's 2025 Hall of Fame Award, recognizing his enduring impact on the fragrance industry as well as its creative influence on modern culture.\nIn addition, our Polo 67 fragrance featuring Yankee's Captain Air and Judge won the 2025 Fragrance of the Year Award Men's Prestige. Congrats to Ralph and our fragrance team. In closing, Ralph and I are encouraged by the strong start to this fiscal year. Our teams are navigating an uncertain operating environment with dedication and agility to continue driving our strategic priorities. These priorities will continue to focus on harnessing the power of our iconic brand to drive desirability and recruit new consumers across generations, creating timeless products with a strong value proposition that consumers love and trust and investing in brand experiences that inspire our consumers and immerse them in the world of Ralph Lauren.\nWith all of this underpinned by our strong balance sheet, culture of operating discipline and growing ability to utilize advanced AI and technology to drive sustainable long-term growth and value creation. We hope you'll tune into our Investor Day this September to hear more from our talented leadership team about the next leg of our next great chapter journey.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Justin, and I'll join him at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJustin Picicci\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong start to fiscal '26 with continued progress on our long-term strategic priorities and first quarter results exceeding the expectations we laid out in May. Revenues were ahead of our outlook, led by international underscoring our growing brand desirability and ability to connect authentically with consumer in the world. We reported positive comp growth in every region in channel this quarter and we achieved this while further advancing our continuous elevation journey with improved quality of sales, a stronger full price selling and lower discounting resulted in higher-than-expected gross and operating margins.\nThis performance was a testament to the incredible passion and dedication of our teams who are executing with excellence amid what continues to be a highly dynamic global operating environment. The strength of our balance sheet and our agile diversified supply chain, which we built to both mitigate global disruptions and support our long-term growth and the diversity of our strategic growth drivers across geographies, channels, lifestyle categories and consumer demographics. Solid performance and our continued momentum give us confidence to raise our full year outlook even as we remain cautious on the broader macroeconomic backdrop primarily in the second half of the fiscal year.\nBut first, let me walk you through our financial highlights from the first quarter which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company first quarter revenue growth of 11% was above our high single-digit outlook led by strong performance in our direct-to-consumer channels. This year's later Easter shifted less than 1 point of sales growth into the quarter from the fourth quarter of fiscal '25 as expected. By region, Asia led our performance with sales increasing 19% followed by Europe, up 10%; and North America, up 8%. Total company retail comps increased 13%, driven by an acceleration in our own digital business and ongoing momentum in our brick-and-mortar channels. Total digital ecosystem sales, including our own sites and wholesale digital accounts, grew mid-teens, led by North America and Asia.\nTop adjusted gross margin expanded 160 basis points to 72.1%. The increase was driven by AUR growth, favorable mix shift towards our full price and international businesses and lower cotton costs, which more than offset higher labor and non-cotton material cost. AUR increased 14% in the first quarter, exceeding our high single-digit outlook and supported y strong full price selling trends, reduced discounting and favorable channel and geographic mix. We currently expect high single-digit AUR growth for the second quarter of fiscal '26. This reflects our ongoing brand elevation strategy, which includes selective pricing actions in North America and Asia for fall of 25.\nIn addition to AUR growth, we expect continued unit growth in targeted markets channel categories. Adjusted operating expenses declined 70 basis points to 55.5% of sales, up 10% to last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and variable selling expenses. First quarter marketing investments increased to 7.5% of sales from 6.7% last year, supporting our always-on cadence of activations in each region, as Patrice discussed. We still expect marketing as a percentage of sales to be approximately 7.3% in fiscal '26. First quarter adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 16.6%, with operating profit increasing 29%, both ahead of guidance.\nMoving to segment performance and starting with North America. First quarter revenue increased 8%, above our expectations due to strong performance in our direct-to-consumer business. In North America retail, first quarter comps increased 12%, led once again by our Ralph Lauren stores. Digital comps increased 19% on strong brand momentum as we advance our investments in site enhancements and optimize our merchandising and marketing. In North America wholesale, revenue increased 2% as we continue to take market share in what remains a broadly volatile channel. Full price sellout was ahead of sell-in this quarter, supported by solid core replenishment trends. Our digital wholesale business continues to perform well with sellout up double digits.\nWhile we are encouraged by our stabilized trend in the channel over the past year, we are maintaining our cautious outlook for fiscal '26 given the potential macro pressures across the broader North America market. We plan to exit another 90 to 100 wholesale doors in fiscal '26 with approximately half of these related to Hudson's Bay.\nMoving to Europe. First quarter revenue increased 10%. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by balanced growth across our retail and wholesale channels. The majority of our key markets delivered growth in the quarter, led by Germany, France, Italy and Spain reflecting strong brand and product momentum. Retail comps increased 10% to last year with balanced growth across our stores and digital channels. Our Europe digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits on top of a solid to the previous year. Europe wholesale also increased 10% driven by continued momentum across both our spring seasonal offering and reorders of core product.\nWe continue to expect full year revenue growth for Europe to be at the high end of mid-single digits and meaningfully weighted to the first half of the year. We continue to anticipate significant deceleration in the second half based on first, a plan shift in wholesale receipts this year from chase-reorders to preorder bookings to service full-price demand more effectively and second, a lapping of last year's timing shifts related to the Red Sea disruption.\nTurning to Asia. First quarter revenue increased 19%, exceeding expectations with every key market contributing to growth. Retail comps were up 18%, with digital and brick-and-mortar store comps both accelerating from the prior quarter, powered by our marketing activations across the region. China led our performance with sales up more than 30% to last year on continued -- strong new customer recruitment and impactful marketing moments, notably our activations in Shanghai. Sales in Japan, our largest market in the region increased high teens to last year, driven by strong full price selling and reduced discounting, along with continued tailwinds from foreign tourism.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation have been key enablers of our Fortress Foundation, supporting investments in our strategic growth drivers while maintaining our commitments to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt. Net inventory increased 18% to last year, reflecting strong global demand for our products, strategic receipt pull forwards, including to mitigate the impact of tariffs in North America and foreign currency headwinds. Excluding tariff-related actions, inventory growth for the quarter would have been approximately in line with revenue growth. We expect inventories to moderate progressively as we move through the year and to end fiscal '26 roughly in line with revenue growth.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current operating environment, geopolitical backdrop and macroeconomic trends. This includes tariffs and other inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and foreign currency fluctuations, among other considerations. Given the high level of volatility in the current context, our outlook continues to be subject to change as trade dynamics and other macro factors continue to evolve. For fiscal '26, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase low to mid-single digits, up from low single digits previously led by growth in our Asia and Europe businesses. We continue to expect this year's performance to be heavily weighted to the first half with first half revenues now assumed up roughly high single to low double digits in constant currency.\nForeign currency is currently expected to benefit revenue growth by about 150 to 200 basis points this year based on the weaker U.S. dollar, notably versus the euro and Japanese yen. While our consumer is consistent with recent quarters, we continue to take a more cautious view on the second half of the year. This is largely based on the potential impact of tariffs and related industry-wide price increases in the U.S. We now expect operating margin to expand approximately 40 to 60 basis points in constant currency compared to our prior guidance of a modest increase. We continue to expect operating margin expansion to be primarily driven by operating expense leverage.\nBased on our strong Q1 performance and latest view of the tariff landscape, we now expect gross margins to be up slightly to last year, with AUR growth, discount reductions and favorable geographic and channel mix offsetting negative impacts from tariffs and noncotton material costs. While the U.S. tariff landscape remains fluid, the assumptions embedded in our original fiscal '26 outlook remain broadly consistent with the announced rates as of August 1, based on our current understanding of their application. And we will continue to leverage our proven tool kit to actively manage cost inflation headwinds as they emerge.\nThis includes our significantly diversified supply chain and ability to flex across production countries while maintaining our high-quality standards, partnering with our suppliers to drive efficiencies in our cost of goods and broader supply chain operations, and taking selective pricing actions and strategic discount reductions, acutely focused on continuing to deliver a compelling value proposition for our customers. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit gross and operating margins by about 10 and 40 basis points, respectively, in fiscal '26.\nFor the second quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately high single digits. Foreign currency is expected to benefit revenues by approximately 100 to 150 basis points. We expect second quarter operating margin to expand approximately 120 to 160 basis points in constant currency largely driven by operating expense leverage and reflecting a more normalized level of marketing investment following last year's Olympics. Foreign currency is expected to benefit gross and operating margins by about 10 and 20 basis points, respectively, in the second quarter. We expect our second quarter tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17% with the lower end of that range, reflecting certain potential discrete tax benefits. We now expect a full year fiscal '26 tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. And in addition to increasing our annual dividend by about 10% at the start of this year, we repurchased $250 million in shares in the first quarter.\nIn closing, our teams are successfully executing on both our near- and long-term strategic priorities as we start this new fiscal year. Inspired by Ralph's enduring vision, consumers everywhere are engaging with our brand in more meaningful ways than ever before, all while we remain true to the values that define us. Values like optimism, authenticity quality and togetherness that resonate not only here in New York, but with customers across the world. As we navigate a highly dynamic macro environment, we continue to focus on mitigating industry disruptions through our operating discipline, strong balance sheet and organizational agility. At the same time, we are leaning into opportunities and staying on offense, investing in our brand, our products, our experiences and our capabilities to better serve and create lasting connections with our customers.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corey Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorey Van der Ghinst\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Fourth Quarter and Year-End Fiscal 2025 Conference Call.

We will also be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As we close out this third and final year of our next great Chapter Accelerate plan, we are proud to have delivered strongly on both our strategic and financial commitments. Our achievements this fiscal year embodied so much of what Ralph Lauren stands for. as one of the most beloved iconic brands in the world. As Ralph would say, it's never been just about a tie or a polisher or a sweater. It's about the values that are so authentic to us. quality, effortless style, time well spent together with family and friends, stepping into our dreams.\nThis year's performance clearly demonstrates the growing desirability of our brand, which remains our most powerful asset and is resonating with consumers around the world, the breadth and appeal of our lifestyle portfolio of products, with an emphasis on elegant timeless style and authenticity and our proven key city ecosystem model, enabling consumers to engage and transact with the world of Ralph Lauren like never before. These diverse drivers of growth, spanning geographies, channels and product categories have enabled us to successfully execute our plans while navigating global volatility over the past several years and they will continue to drive our growth into the future.\nWe reported fourth quarter results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. This strong performance was broad-based, driven by every geography and channel. For the full year, we delivered 8% top line growth including record revenues for our international businesses, Europe and Asia, which together now comprise the majority of total company revenues and adjusted operating profits grew 24%. This exceeded the expectations we laid out last May, even as we chose to invest in our long-term strategic priorities and returns to our shareholders.\nAs we turn to fiscal '26, the global operating environment has become more challenged with uncertainty around tariffs and broader consumer behavior. Despite macro pressures, we are well positioned, having fundamentally transformed our business and built a more agile organization over the past several years. This strong foundation is built on a timeless brand that consumers know and trust, a portfolio comprised of 70% core products that perform across economic cycles, a culture of operating discipline with an ability to flex expenses, a diverse and agile supply chain and importantly, a strong balance sheet.\nFor our teams, this is a time to stay on offense while remaining prudent and agile in how we allocate our resources. We are pursuing opportunities that will strengthen our business for the long term, including further investments in our brands to increase desirability and market share, solidifying our presence in key markets and new technology, data, AI and analytics to better serve our consumers and drive greater efficiencies in our business.\nNow let me take you through a few highlights from the quarter where we drove continued progress across our 3 long-term strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand.\nOur brand uniquely transcends generations, genders and geographies to our authentic values and lifestyle approach. We sit at the intersection of culture and our marketing investments reflect this, spanning fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming, music and more. From our unforgettable Olympics and summer of sports to our showstopping fashion events in the Hamptons, Shanghai, Milan and Paris, we create authentic emotionally connected moments to engage and inspire consumers around the world. Highlights from the fourth quarter included, first, our global spring '25 Hamptons campaign capturing the understated luxury and timeless style of Ralph's cherished [indiscernible]. We took the concept around the world from our latest roadblocks digital experience, Polo Beach, to our Rouse Hamptons house in Dubai, all culminating in our first-ever fashion event in Shanghai in early April.\nSecond, we continue to celebrate the resilience and joy of sports with our fifth annual sponsorship of the Australian Open, our official count down to the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, and our 2025 Major League Baseball World Tour Tokyo series. These sports activations generated over 23 billion impressions in the quarter. Finally, our collections were featured on celebrities and friends of the brand from the Street to the red carpet, including Selina Gomez at the Oscars; Hero Yuki Sanalla, winning his Golden Globe in Purple Label; Casey Musgraves at the Grammys; Kendall Jenner in our iconic Ponycaps; [indiscernible] carrying our Polo ID bag; and Billy Eilish on her global album tour.\nTogether, these activities are driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. Over the past year, we added a record 5.9 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, a high single-digit increase to last year. This continued to be led by younger, female and less price-sensitive cohorts. And we increased our social media followers by low double digits, surpassing $65 million led by LINE, Threads, WeChat, [indiscernible] and TikTok. We plan to build on this rolling thunder of brand activities with powerful new engagements into fiscal year 2016 and beyond.\nMoving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Ralph and our design teams continue to create beautiful, exceptionally styled products for our consumers' modern lifestyles, all while staying true to the quality and sophistication that define our iconic brand. As the industry faces a number of inflationary cost pressures from freight and cotton in recent years to tariffs, we remain laser focused on our consumers and how we deliver value to them. We have a proven multiyear track record of AUR growth, all while continuing to strengthen our value and luxury perceptions.\nOur AUR growth has been driven by a combination of investments to elevate both our brand and product quality, geographic, channel and category mix, discount reductions and select pricing actions. These multiple drivers give us confidence as we continue to manage through cost headwinds with strong pricing power. This starts with our core products, which represent the majority of our business. Our broad portfolio of core products remains an important differentiator in our industry, even more so through times of uncertainty as consumers turn to brands and styles they know and trust.\nCore product sales grew low double digits in the quarter, as we successfully transitioned from a strong holiday into spring. Growth was led by cable net sweaters, outerwear, such as our quilted jackets by swing windbreaker and Midway down Goram jacket, and hats. In addition, our newer linen offerings continue to gain momentum, up double digits to last year. Our high potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags, together increased high teens.\nWomen's and outerwear highlights this quarter included sweaters, including our iconic Polo Bear and flag sweaters, shirts from Oxford to Linen and Poplin, dresses and are sold out Western inspired fringe sway jacket with MetaPorte. Handbag sales once again outpaced our expectations, growing double digits in the fourth quarter and full year. This was supported by continued strength in our sophisticated Polo ID collection as well as the spring launch of our newest foundational handbag family Polo [indiscernible], featuring a vibrant rainbow of colors in pebbled Italian leather and cotton canvas, Polo play is off to a strong start.\nTurning to our third key initiative. Winning key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We continue to develop our key city ecosystems across every region this year, comprised of our own and partner stores, digital flagships, and selective wholesale presence, these ecosystems support our brand elevation and growth as we invite consumers to step into the cinematic world of Ralph Lauren. Within DTC, which comprises 2/3 of our business, we drove accelerated comp growth this quarter. Comps increased 13%, above our expectations with double-digit growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores.\nGlobally, we opened 83 new owned and partner stores this year, focused on our top cities, largely in Asia. Recent store opening highlights included our Polo store opening on Jackson Street in San Francisco, marking our first return to the city since the pandemic, new stores in Beijing's Joy City and Seasons Place shopping centers, and our newest boutique in can and Candy shop concept at Brent Cross in London, reinforcing our presence in the France and U.K. markets. All 3 regions outperformed our expectations again in the fourth quarter following our strong Q3 holiday results. We were particularly encouraged by double-digit growth in both Europe and Asia including sustained growth in the U.K. and more than 20% growth in China on top of a strong double-digit compare last year.\nIn North America maintained healthy trends up mid-single digits on ongoing strength in DTC and planned stabilization in wholesale. And finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Some of the highlights over the past year included successfully integrating predictive buying across 25% of our international DTC businesses, allowing us to drive greater inventory efficiencies and better service consumer demand celebrating the opening of the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at USC Norris, the first on the West Coast and third in the U.S. Funded by the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, these centers are part of an ongoing commitment to cancer care in underserved communities.\nAnd who could forget Ralph becoming the first fashion designer ever to receive the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, recognizing his extraordinary contributions to culture and society. In closing, Ralph and I are proud of our team's dedication, agility and excellent execution in delivering on our commitments. Our strong fiscal '25 performance reinforces our confidence in our powerful brand, diversified growth drivers and fortress balance sheet to support future growth and mitigate near-term economic headwinds.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal '26, we are staying prudent and flexible in what clearly continues to be a complex and dynamic global operating environment. Even within this context, we remain on offense with a focus on driving our brand momentum and consistently executing on our strategic priorities.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Justin, and I'll join him at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJustin Picicci\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '25 was another successful year for Ralph Lauren. We delivered on the financial commitments we laid out last May, and made meaningful progress against our long-term strategic priorities. We closed out the year with fourth quarter results that exceeded our expectations across revenues and gross and operating margins. All 3 regions contributed to both revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nIn addition to driving excitement and desirability for our branded products around the world, we were especially proud to reinforce our strong quality of sales. consistent with our long-term elevation strategy. At the same time, our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation enabled us to continue investing behind our key strategic growth drivers while maintaining our commitments to shareholders. We generated $1 billion of free cash flow this year, enabling us to return $625 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. And our Board of Directors recently authorized a 10% increase in our annual dividend and an additional $1.5 billion in share repurchases to support future returns.\nThese results are strong proof points of our multiple drivers of growth as we enter the new fiscal year in the midst of a more uncertain global consumer backdrop. Let me walk you through our financial highlights from the fourth quarter, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company fourth quarter revenue growth of 10% was above our 6% to 7% outlook driven by better performance in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. This year's later Easter shifted about 1 point of sales growth from the fourth quarter into the first quarter of next fiscal year.\nBy region, Europe led our performance with sales increasing 16%, followed by Asia up 13% and North America up 6%. Total company comp sales increased 13%, led by an acceleration in our own digital business and ongoing momentum in our brick-and-mortar channels. Total digital ecosystem sales, including owned sites and wholesale digital accounts, grew high teens, led by Europe. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 69.2%. This increase was driven by AUR growth, favorable mix shift towards our full price and international businesses and lower cotton costs more than offsetting higher noncotton material cost.\nAUR increased 9% in the fourth quarter. supported by strong full price selling trends, reduced discounting and favorable channel and geographic mix. We expect similar high single-digit AUR growth in the first quarter of fiscal '26, reflecting our ongoing brand elevation strategy. Adjusted operating expenses grew 11% to 58.1% of sales, up 30 basis points to last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and variable selling expenses. Fourth quarter marketing investments increased 9% to 6.5% of sales.\nFull year marketing grew 11% to 7.3% of sales, ahead of our long-term strategic target of 7%, and we expect a similar level of marketing as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 11.1%, and operating profit increased 40%, both ahead of plan.\nMoving to segment performance. and starting with North America, fourth quarter revenue increased 6%, exceeding our outlook due to stronger-than-expected sales in both our DTC and wholesale channels. And the region delivered its highest fourth quarter adjusted operating margin since we began our elevation journey more than 8 years ago. In North America Retail, fourth quarter comps increased 9% and with strong growth in both our Ralph Lauren and outlet stores. Digital comps increased 8%, improving sequentially on recent interventions. And we drove another strong quarter in our digital wholesale business, with sellout up low teens.\nTotal North America wholesale revenue increased 2%. Our wholesale AUR increased low single digits on well-positioned inventories in the channel. Full price sell-out was once again in line with sell-in this quarter after adjusting for the Easter shift, supported by a strong product offering and growth in core replenishment. While we are encouraged by our recent stabilization in the channel, we maintain our cautious outlook into fiscal '26 on potential macro challenges in the broader North America market.\nWe completed the exit of 60 department store doors this fiscal year. And we plan to exit about 90 doors in fiscal '26 with approximately half of these related to Hudson's Bay. While the ongoing exits are not material to our financial results, we continue to proactively evaluate and refine our brand presence on a door-by-door basis. Moving to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% and driven by double-digit growth in both our retail and wholesale channels. All of our key markets delivered growth in the quarter and for the full year, led by Germany, France and Italy.\nSales grew in the U.K. for the second consecutive quarter, following several years of inflationary pressures, reflecting strong brand momentum and continued improvement in our underlying trends. Europe retail comps increased 18% to last year, led by our digital channels with continued strong momentum in our brick-and-mortar businesses. Our digital ecosystem, including owned and wholesale digital accounts, grew more than 20% on top of a solid compare last year. Europe wholesale increased 14%, supported by strong reorder trends and the previously discussed timing shift of receipts from the second quarter to the back half of the year.\nAdjusting for the shifts, wholesale would have increased roughly mid-single digits to last year, in line with our underlying trend of low to mid-single-digit growth in the channel. Turning to Asia. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13%, with all markets contributing to growth for both the quarter and the full year. Retail comps were up 15%, and with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores, fueled by our impactful brand activations across the region.\nBy market, our performance was led by China, which grew more than 20% to last year on continued comp growth, high-quality new customer recruitment and key marketing moments, including our Lunar New Year activations. Sales in Japan increased mid-teen to last year, driven by strong full price selling and reduced discounting, along with continued tailwinds from foreign tourism. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory was up 5% to last year, reflecting increased global demand for our products and the timing shift of Easter into the first quarter of fiscal '26. Inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook and we continue to manage inventories with discipline in line with consumer demand.\nStrategic and thoughtful balance sheet management has been a key enabler for Ralph Lauren. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us to weather significant industry volatility, make the best long-term decisions to protect and enhance our brand and fuel our strategic investments while also returning cash to shareholders. In the current environment, we are focused on leaning into market opportunities and investing for long-term growth. This includes investing in key city marketing activations, upgrading our store experiences, and pursuing very selective real estate opportunities as we continue to drive DTC-led growth.\nFor example, in April, we acquired our global Polo flagship location in Soho, Manhattan, one of New York's premier shopping destinations. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current operating environment and consumer behavior. This includes tariffs, inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, supply chain disruptions and foreign currency fluctuations, among other considerations. Given the high level of volatility in the current context, we consider our full year outlook to be preliminary based on the information available today and subject to change as trade dynamics and other macro factors continue to evolve.\nFor fiscal '26, we expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, driven by our growth in our Asia and Europe businesses. We expect this year's performance to be heavily weighted to the first half of the year, notably Q1, with first half revenues up roughly mid-single digits. While we have not seen a change in our underlying business trends from Q4 into Q1 to date, we believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view on the second half of the year based on a number of macro indicators. Notably, the impact of tariffs, weakening consumer confidence in the U.S. and increased risk of a broader consumer pullback and a more uncertain global operating environment in general.\nWe currently expect operating margin to expand modestly in constant currency, largely driven by SG&A leverage. Based on our current view of the tariff landscape, we expect gross margins to be roughly flat to last year. with AUR growth, discount reductions and favorable product, DTC and international mix, offsetting negative impacts from tariffs and noncotton material costs. We are assessing additional pricing actions for Fall '25 and Spring '26 to mitigate the potential impact of evolving tariffs. This is on top of the proactive pricing we already planned for Fall '25 in North America and Asia.\nWhile tariffs will primarily impact our gross margins beginning in the second half of the year, we have a proven tool kit to manage cost inflation headwinds. This includes: first, significant supply chain diversification. We work with our many key suppliers worldwide to flex volume is based on quality and cost. No single country accounts for more than 20% of our production volumes with most countries representing a single-digit percentage, including our China production for the U.S.\nSecond, partnering with our suppliers to drive other efficiencies in our cost of goods and broader supply chain operations. And third, taking selective pricing actions and strategic discount reductions, with the goal of continuing to deliver the best value proposition for our consumers. While tariffs are expected to be a headwind, we are better positioned than ever before with greater agility to mitigate related pressures with a more elevated less price-sensitive customer base, international business that now represents 57% of our total revenues, up from 45% pre-pandemic. Gross margins that are 700 basis points higher than our pre-pandemic levels and disciplined inventory management and the ability to flex expenses.\nWe expect freight to be roughly neutral in fiscal '26. And based on our recent ocean contract renewals. Foreign currency is expected to have a relatively minimal impact on revenue as well as on gross and operating margins in fiscal '26. For the first quarter, which is marginally impacted by tariffs. We expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately high single digits. We expect first quarter operating margin to expand approximately 150 to 200 basis points in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion as well as by modest operating expense leverage.\nForeign currency is expected to have a roughly neutral impact on revenue and on gross and operating margins in the first quarter. We expect our first quarter tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. And a full year fiscal '26 tax rate of approximately 20% to 22%. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of approximately 4% to 5% of sales, in line with our long-term outlook. This includes our recent Prince Street store acquisition and ongoing investments in our key city ecosystems, technology and AI and and our multiyear next-generation transformation project, which we kicked off in fiscal '24.\nIn closing, we are proud of our team's execution in this third and final year of our next great chapter Accelerate plan. guided by Ralph's enduring vision of inspiring people everywhere to step into their dream of a better life. We will continue to navigate the evolving global environment with agility and resolve and remain acutely focused on delivering on our strategic priorities.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We entered this important holiday quarter with a clear game plan, along with strong brand and product momentum, and our teams around the world delivered particularly well, executing our long-term strategy across geographies, channels and categories to outperform our financial commitments. This quarter's results underscore the powerful combination of our iconic timeless brand and products, our durable and diversified levers of growth, and our ability to connect authentically with consumers across genders, generations and markets through our proven key city ecosystem model.\nThird quarter results, with revenue up double digits, exceeded our expectations in every geography across the top and bottom line. Our strong first half brand momentum and strategic investments carried into the fall holiday season, driving better-than-expected consumer demand in each channel, and the agility of our global supply chain enabled us to meet the upside to demand during the quarter.\nOur retail business led our performance again, delivering double-digit comp growth, along with improving trends in digital. DTC continues to be a leading indicator of our growing brand desirability and the power of our ecosystem model. We are encouraged that this momentum is now also delivering accelerated growth in wholesale as we continue to elevate and reposition the channel. Building on our high-impact summer of sports and Hampton's fashion event, we invested in innovative marketing campaigns to engage and inspire consumers around the world. This is translating to high-quality new customer acquisition and full price selling in the marketplace.\nThird quarter retail AUR grew another double digits on higher full price penetration and lower-than-planned promotions. At the same time, we continue to operate with discipline to improve our expense management across the organization and strengthen our balance sheet. This enables us to invest behind our strategic priorities, all while delivering double-digit growth in profitability and returning cash to our shareholders.\nLet me take you through a few highlights from the quarter, where we drove continued progress across our 3 strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, Elevate and Energize Our Lifestyle Brand; second, Drive the Core and Expand for More; and third, Win In Key Cities With Our Consumer Ecosystem. First, on our Efforts to Elevate and Energize Our Lifestyle Brand. Across generations and geographies, we continue to harness the power of our iconic brand, cutting through culture across key moments in fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music. Some highlights from the third quarter included: first, our global holiday campaigns, which translated the magic and timeless elegance of Ralph Lauren around the world. In New York City, you may have interacted with our AI-powered Polo Bear blowing kisses from our Madison Avenue flagship windows, or our immersive holiday pop-up shop at Saks Fifth Avenue, featuring our handbags in Ralph's Coffee Shop. At our Gangnam store in Seoul, Starz, JY Park and IsacHong lit up the night with special performances at our Ralph's New York event. And in Europe, we drove top city activations in London, Milan, Munich and Paris, staying top of mind following our powerful Olympics presence this past summer.\nSecond, our very Ralph documentary launch in Shanghai, complete with a spectacular drone show over the historic Bunt waterfront and star studied Gala with friends on a brand like Crystal Young and Suzu. Highlighting Ralph's journey and unique position in fashion, the campaign was a special opportunity to share our brand values with Chinese consumers, generating more than 30 million livestream views and 67 billion impressions.\nFinally, we outfitted an incredible roster of celebrities including Demi Moore, Selena Gomez, Eva Longoria and Mike Madison at the El Women in Hollywood event. Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey selected Ralph Lauren for the Wicked Movie Premier in London, as did Nicole Kidman for the cover of W Magazine. Together, these activities are driving strong, sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. In the third quarter, we added a record 1.9 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, a low double-digit increase to last year. This continued to be led by younger, higher value and less price-sensitive cohorts.\nOur brand further strengthened across key consumer metrics with increases across brand consideration, purchase intent and Net Promoter Scores globally. And we grew both our value perception and luxury equity scores, particularly with next-gen consumers.\nWe continue to increase our social media followers by low double digits to last year, surpassing 64 million, led by Instagram, Threads, Line, TikTok and Douyin. We plan to continue building on this brand strength with powerful new engagements into fiscal year 2016 and beyond.\nMoving to our second key initiative, Drive The Core And Expand For More. Since our company's inception, Ralph and our design teams have focused on creating timeless products that endure. This holds especially true in the current environment where we continue to see consumers turn to brands they know and trust that consistently deliver quality and value. At Ralph Lauren, this starts with our core products, which represent more than 70% of our business and includes some of our best-known styles from our iconic mesh polo shirts to cable-knit sweaters and Polo caps. Sales of our core products increased low teens, ahead of our total company growth in the third quarter. Our high potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags, together increased 20%. Women's and outerwear highlights this quarter included quilted mid-weight and puffer jackets, cotton cable-knit and wool cashmere sweaters, our coveted Polo bear sweaters and short dresses. Handbags also exceeded our expectations, with sales up strong double digits to last year, supported this holiday by an exclusive collaboration with Mr. Bags in China and pop-ups in New York City and Paris. Polo Women's led this performance once again, supported by our Polo IG bag with new seasonal colors and fabrications like chocolate and Suad. Other special releases this quarter included our RRL Capsule with Navajo Artist Zephrine-M. This represents the second collaboration in our groundbreaking artist and residence program focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. And our annual Pink Pony collection supporting Ralph Lauren's long-standing commitment to cancer care and research.\nTurning to our third key initiative, Win In Key Cities With Our Consumer Ecosystem. We continue to focus on developing our key city ecosystems around the world. These ecosystems support the long-term elevation of our brand by inviting consumers to step into the world of Ralph Lauren with consistency across each of our consumer channels and touch points. Within DTC, which comprises 2/3 of our business, we drove accelerated comp growth this quarter. Comps increased 12%, above our expectations, led by double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar stores, while our own digital sites also performed ahead of plan. Globally, we opened 34 new own and partner stores focused on our top cities, largely in Asia.\nStore opening highlights during the period included Polo boutiques in Hong Kong Pacific Place and Beijing's China World Mall, both featuring Ralph's coffee, our stunning new Ralph Lauren Collection shop for women at Harrods in London, one of our most elevated spaces to date, and our vibrant Candy Store Polo Shop in Edinburgh St. James Quarter. As we continue to test and learn with new store formats, the candy store represents a new smaller format concept for us with fun highly flexible spaces. The dual-gender shops are curated with our most iconic Polo products that play on our Love Of Color, from sweaters and rugby shirts to a rainbow of Pony caps and Mesh polos. Each of our 3 regions outperformed our expectations this holiday.\nWe were particularly encouraged by mid-teens growth in Europe, supported by broad-based strength across our markets, including a return to growth in the U.K. Asia also continued to perform well, with mid-teens growth including China sales of more than 20%. And North America accelerated to high single-digit growth this quarter on ongoing strength in DTC and a meaningful improvement in wholesale trends.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Sharing a few highlights. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of our teams. Their engagement and love for what we do is evidenced not only in their excellent execution, but in how they show up for one another and the communities we serve. Whether that's our corporate teams volunteering hundreds of hours to support our retail teams during the peak holiday season, or teams across every region working directly in our communities to support those in need. Their commitment to our business, our brand and our values is unmatched. And just a few weeks ago, Ralph became the first fashion designer ever to receive the presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. The award recognized Ralph's extraordinary contributions to culture and society as a visionary designer, trailblazing entrepreneur, innovative business leader and dedicated philanthropists. His vision continues to inspire us here at the company every day. Congratulations to Ralph.\nIn closing, we are strongly encouraged by our team's progress through the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, including the important holiday season. At the same time, we remain sharply focused on what's ahead for Ralph Lauren leveraging the incredible power of our brand and durable diversified drivers of growth to stay on offense into the next year and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Justin, and I'll join him at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJustin Picicci\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our strong third quarter performance reinforce the confidence we have in our diversified growth drivers and premium position in the marketplace. As our teams continue to deliver with excellence on our near-term commitments, we remain focused on investing in the strategic priorities that will enable us to better serve our customers and sustain our growth into the future. These include our brand, the continued elevation of our products, our digital capabilities and technology and our top city ecosystems around the world.\nThird quarter results meaningfully exceeded our expectations across revenues and gross and operating margins, delivering one of our most successful holidays to date. All 3 regions contributed to operating margin expansion as planned, with North America reporting its highest third quarter adjusted operating margin since we began our elevation journey more than 7 years ago. And we achieved all of this while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and cash flows, with approximately $980 million in free cash flows and $500 million in returns to shareholders year-to-date.\nThis continued progress gives us confidence in raising our full year outlook once again. But first, let me walk you through our financial highlights from the third quarter, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis.\nTotal company third quarter revenue growth of 11% was above our outlook with better-than-expected performance in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Total company retail comps grew 12% as our holiday product offering and marketing campaigns resonated with consumers across regions.\nTotal digital ecosystem sales, including our own sites and wholesale digital accounts, increased mid-teens, accelerating from prior quarter trends. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 190 basis points to 68.3%. This strong performance was driven by AUR growth, reduced promotions and favorable mix shift towards our full-price businesses and lower cotton costs, partially offset by higher freight expense to mitigate East Coast port disruptions.\nAUR increased 12% in the third quarter. This exceeded our mid-single-digit outlook as demand for our core and seasonal products drove better-than-expected full price selling trends. Our ability to drive strong sales early in the quarter through Black Friday week also enabled us to pull back on planned promotions through the remainder of the period. As a result, we reduced our global discount rate by more than 500 basis points, meaningfully greater than expected.\nIn the fourth quarter, we are planning for high single-digit AUR growth as we pull back further on end-of-season discounting across all regions following our strong holiday sell-throughs in Q3.\nAdjusted operating expenses grew 10% to 49.7% of sales, down 30 basis points to last year. The improvement was driven by higher-than-expected sales and the planned cadence of marketing investments, which represented 7.1% of third quarter sales compared to 7.5% last year. We continue to expect full year marketing at about 7% of sales.\nExcluding marketing, adjusted operating expense rate was flat to last year as ongoing cost savings offset continued reinvestment in our business.\nOur adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, and operating profit increased 27%, both ahead of plan.\nMoving to segment performance, and starting with North America, third quarter revenue increased 7%, exceeding our expectations. While momentum continued in our retail channels, we were especially encouraged by our return to growth in wholesale this quarter. In North America retail, third quarter comps increased 8%. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 10%, with strong growth in both full price and outlet stores. Digital comps increased 3%, improving sequentially as we invested in more targeted marketing, merchandising and site enhancements under our new digital leadership. And our digital wholesale business accelerated to low teen sellout in the quarter.\nTotal North America wholesale revenues increased 6%, above our expectations. Our wholesale AUR increased mid-single digits on well-positioned inventories in the channel. Full price sellout was in line with our sellin this quarter, supported by a strong fall product offering and growth in core replenishment. We expect our wholesale sellin to be up slightly in Q4 and continue to be generally aligned with our sellout trends.\nOur outlook now includes the planned exit of 60 departmental store doors this fiscal year. While the ongoing exits are not material to our financial results, we continue to proactively evaluate and refine our brand presence on a door-by-door basis.\nMoving to Europe, third quarter revenue increased 16%, driven by strong performance across our retail and wholesale channels. Growth was supported by brand momentum from this year's highly impactful marketing activations. All of our key markets delivered growth in the quarter, led by double-digit revenue growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. And encouragingly, sales grew in the U.K. this holiday as our underlying trends in the market continue to improve. In Europe retail, comps increased 17% to last year, above our expectations. Growth was balanced across our brick-and-mortar and digital channels. Europe AUR continued to grow strongly on top of last year's low double-digit increase, driven by our brand elevation. Similar to recent quarterly trends, our discount rates declined meaningfully to last year despite a competitive promotional environment.\nEurope wholesale increased 14% to last year, also above our plan, supported by strong reorder trends in the previously discussed timing shift of receipts from the second quarter. Excluding the shifts, wholesale would have increased roughly low double digits to last year. Our digital wholesale sales increased strong double digits, driven by continued brand momentum at digital pure-play accounts. This performance was especially notable given challenging compares from last year's restocking in the channel. We continue to expect stronger Europe wholesale growth in the second half of fiscal '25, including Q4, based on solid underlying trends and the receipt shifts from Q2 into Q3 and Q4.\nLooking ahead, we remain encouraged by our team's strong execution and our elevated positioning across channels in Europe, and we are focused on delivering powerful new connections with customers in the year ahead as we build on the momentum from our recent brand initiatives.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 15%, reflecting growth in all markets. Retail comps were up 14% on top of a similar 14% increase last year, with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. Asia results exceeded our outlook led by continued outperformance in China. Our China market grew more than 20% to last year, above our plan and driven by comp growth, high-quality new customer recruitment and key marketing moments, including our very Ralph event in Shanghai and Singles Day live streaming activations.\nSales in Japan were also strong, growing low double digits to last year, supported by accelerated domestic consumer trends, driven by key brand activations, VIC engagement and luxury events, along with continued tailwinds from inbound tourism. Partnerships with key talent, including Mark Lee, Winter and Sana and [indiscernible] Takao also helped deliver solid growth in Korea and the broader Asia region this quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows continue to be key enablers of our Fortress foundation, allowing us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Our teams continue to leverage our agile and diversified supply chain to manage through global industry disruptions.\nWith regards to the recently announced U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada, we currently anticipate a minimal annual impact.\nThird quarter net inventory decreased 5% to last year even as we improved our in-stock rates of popular core and seasonal products to fulfill stronger-than-expected consumer demand this quarter. Inventories in each of our regions are well positioned as we exit holiday and enter the spring season, and we still expect to end fiscal '25 with inventories generally aligned to revenue growth. Weeks of supply continue to decline as we improve our inventory efficiency through initiatives like our predictive buying model, which is designed to put our core top-selling styles in the right channels at the right time. This new buying framework is just one element of our upcoming next-generation transformation strategy, which will bring together our new global ERP system with integrated business planning tools and more productive, agile logistics to align with our increasingly global DTC-oriented business going forward.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures, tariffs and other consumer spending related headwinds, supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility, among other considerations. For fiscal '25, we now expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 6% to 7%, up from 3% to 4% growth previously, reflecting our strong year-to-date performance. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact full year revenue growth by about 100 to 150 basis points due to a stronger U.S. dollar.\nWe now expect operating margin to expand about 120 to 160 basis points, up slightly from our prior outlook, driven by gross margin expansion of about 130 to 170 basis points.\nIn constant currency, relative to our fiscal '22 Investor Day base period, this puts us on track to exceed our 15% operating margin target this year.\nForeign currency is expected to negatively impact both our gross and operating margins by about 30 to 50 basis points.\nFor the fourth quarter, we also expect constant currency revenues to increase in a range of approximately 6% to 7%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue by approximately 300 basis points. Wholesale is expected to remain on its positive trajectory as North America sellin more closely aligns to sellout and Europe wholesale receipts continue shifting to the back half of the fiscal year from Q2. Our outlook still includes approximately 1 point of negative impact in the fourth quarter from the timing of Easter, which shifts into Q1 of fiscal '26.\nWe expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 120 to 140 basis points in constant currency, driven by roughly 80 to 120 basis points of gross margin expansion and modest operating expense leverage. Marketing as a percent of sales is expected to be about flat to last year in the fourth quarter as we concentrated a higher share of this year's marketing dollars on our Summer of Sports and Holiday campaigns.\nForeign currency is expected to negatively impact gross and operating margins by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. We still expect our fiscal '25 tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the full year, while the fourth quarter rate is expected to be around 24% to 25%. And lastly, our outlook includes CapEx in the range of $200 million to $250 million.\nIn closing, guided by Ralph's creative vision, our teams captured the magic of the holidays and delivered on our purpose of inspiring the dream of a better life. Our strong performance this quarter further underscores Ralph Lauren's unique emotional connection with consumers around the world. This, combined with our diversified growth drivers and organizational agility, reinforces our confidence in delivering against both our financial and strategic commitments to ensure sustainable value creation into the future.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We started year 3 of our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan with continued momentum, keeping us on track with our fiscal '25 and long-term strategic commitments. Our first quarter performance underscores the power and growing desirability of our iconic brand around the world with key moments that demonstrate our ability to resonate across cultures, geographies and generations. This, combined with our diversified engines of growth and organizational agility gives us confidence that our long-term strategy will continue to deliver even through these dynamic times.\nFirst quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by international and positive retail comps across all regions with continued momentum across consumer metrics. Performance in our global direct-to-consumer businesses in Europe wholesale more than offset planned softness in North America wholesale.\nAt the same time, we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, including marketing, digital capabilities and our targeted ecosystem expansion across our top cities. Fueled by our culture of operating discipline and increased efficiencies, these investments will enable us to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation well beyond our current 3-year plan.\nDuring the first quarter, we drove continued progress across our 3 strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, Elevate and Energize our Lifestyle brand; second, Drive the Core and Expand for More; and third, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem.\nLet me take you through a few highlights from the first quarter. First, on our efforts to Elevate and Energize our Lifestyle brand. From our recent activations in Milan, London, New York and across China to our rapidly expanding social media following, Ralph Lauren continues to be at the forefront of culture across geographies and demographics. Key campaigns from the quarter included: first, our Women's Collection Runway Show in New York City this April, where we celebrated the timeless easy elegance that has come to define our brand. The collection also tapped into some of our signature design codes from Western motives to shimmering liquid gallons and cozy rich cash mirrors, signaling a confident quiet luxury as Ralph does best.\nThe globally amplified event surpassed our goals driving 16 billion PR impressions as we were joined by celebrities, including Jodie Turner Smith, Jessica Chastain, Kerry Washington, Crystal Young, Rebecca Hall and Morgan Spector.\nHeading into warmer months, we reinforced our position as the ultimate destination for effortless summer icons with our only Polo campaign. Our teams delivered local activations spanning L.A. Sunset Boulevard, Roppongi in Tokyo, SoHo in New York, Miami Design District, Dubai and Soule. The stars aligned in Milan at our Purple Label presentation this June where Usher, John Legend, Chris Pine and Rupert Wainwright, among others, honored our newest collection as part of Men's Fashion Week.\nDuring the city's renowned home design fair, Salone del Mobile, we unveiled our first collection with our new licensing partner and invited the international design community to experience American style in Milan. Our 618 activations in China drove high double-digit growth that significantly outpaced our competitive set. Our teams are leveraging these events for longer-term brand building with a focus on high-quality sales and new customer acquisition.\nAnd finally, we are in the midst of a spectacular summer of sports. We kicked off our 2024 Paris Olympics campaign, unveiling our uniforms as official outfitter of Teen USA, a cherished partnership over 9 Olympic games since 2008. And beyond the quarter, we celebrated our 19th year as official outfitter of the championships at Wimbledon, marrying the traditions of the story tournament with sophisticated spectator style.\nThese activations are driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement. In the first quarter, we added 1.3 million new consumers to our GTC businesses, consistent with our long-term expectations and led by higher value and younger cohorts. Our Net Promoter Scores increased globally, led by Europe, and our online search grew strong double digits, outpacing our competitive set. And we grew our social media followers by low teens to last year, surpassing 60 million led by Instagram, Threads, LINE, TikTok and Douyin.\nMoving next to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. While many aspire to become true lifestyle brands, Ralph created a brand that has optimized the aspirational lifestyle for over 50 years. And as we look ahead, Ralph and our design teams will continue to leverage our powerful portfolio of highly recognizable core products with expansion into newer categories to realize our brand's full potential.\nStarting with our core products, which represent more than 70% of our business. Sales were up low single digits, slightly ahead of our total company growth in the first quarter. Highlights from this spring included our linen styles from sport shirts to tailored suits, newly relaunched stretch mesh polos, elevated heavyweight Jersey and Polo Bear Ts and sweaters. In children's, Linen also drove outsized growth along with seasonal mini cable and flag sweaters and our expansion within the big kids segment. Our high-potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags together increased mid-single digits outpacing our total company growth rate as we continue to drive our strategy of foundational pieces to anchor her modern wardrobe.\nTop sellers and women's this quarter included our iconic cable net sweaters Linen and Oxford shirts, Polos and short dresses and easier fits and our Canvas city jacket. Within handbags, we drove strong growth led by Polo women's where continued momentum in our Polo ID collection is driving both revenues on higher AUR as well as new customer recruitment, as highlighted by Jennifer Lawrence supporting our yellow Polo ID bag this spring.\nOther exciting releases this quarter included our Wimbledon capsule featuring tennis inspired sportswear with sell-throughs up strong double digits to last year across men's, women's and kids. And our Summer Olympics collections, including our opening and closing ceremony uniforms and Olympic Village wear an assortment of Polo sportswear icons retold through the sophisticated lens of Paris.\nTurning to our third key initiative, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem. Our Key City Ecosystems around the world are driving elevation and consistency across all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites where we offer our most elevated consumer experiences and engagement.\nIn the first quarter, we drove solid DTC comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Comps were up mid-single digits in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital channels. Globally, we opened 8 new owned and partnered stores focused on our top cities, largely in Asia. And we recently welcomed consumers back into our newly renovated Chicago flagship on Michigan Avenue. In addition to our famed RL Restaurant, the store now also includes our first Ralph's coffee shop in the Midwest. With more than 30 coffee shops and [ fiber ] restaurants, we are now engaging with over 3 million consumers annually through our hospitality business. attracting a new generation of consumers to our iconic brand around the world.\nBy region, growth was led by Asia, up another high single digits this quarter and consistent with our outlook. This was followed by better-than-expected performance once again in Europe, while North America was in line with our plan. Our China momentum continued with sales up low double digits this quarter, over an exceptionally strong compare of up more than 50% last year. While we are watching macro developments and consumer behavior closely, our teams continue to successfully grow our brand desirability with domestic Chinese consumers.\nIn addition, our ecosystem expansion remains disciplined as we largely focus on our 6 key city clusters.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. This quarter featured some incredible moments as we embed citizenship and sustainability in all we do. First, our groundbreaking artists and residence collaboration with Navajo Designer Naiomi Glasses, recently won the Fast Company Innovation by Design Award in the fashion and beauty category. It was also recognized that the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen. And we were proud to recently be named one of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity 2024 and and on Parity.org's 2024 parity list, recognizing organizations that support equal advancement opportunities in the workplace.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are encouraged by our team's solid start to this fiscal year as we continue to operate with agility, we are successfully marrying the magic of Ralph's original vision with a data-driven mindset to support and grow our iconic brand across new generations and geographies, shifting our business towards DTC and a more elevated wholesale presence and leveraging our nimble global supply chain and culture of operational discipline in order to mitigate ongoing disruptions, drive greater long-term efficiency and better serve our consumers.\nEntering the important fall holiday season, we remain on offense and in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to our new CFO, Justin, to walk us through the financials, and I'll join him at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJustin Picicci\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. It's a privilege for me to step into the CFO role and I'm grateful for the support that Ralph, Patrice, [ Shane ] and the Board have all shown me throughout this transition. I know I speak for the entire Ralph Lauren team when I say we remain firmly committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives, leveraging the power of our timeless brand and strong momentum around the world.\nWe had a solid start to fiscal '25 with first quarter top and bottom line results ahead of our expectations. This quarter's performance underscores the continued momentum and growing desirability of our brand as well as our multiple drivers of growth, which enabled us to deliver on our commitments even in a highly dynamic global operating environment. Our progress in Q1 also gives us confidence in reiterating the full year outlook we introduced in May. Let's talk through our financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis.\nTotal company first quarter revenue growth of 3% exceeded our guidance, led once again by our direct-to-consumer channels and international businesses. Total company retail comps grew 5% with balanced growth across our brick-and-mortar and digital channels. Total digital ecosystem sales including our own sites and wholesale digital accounts, increased high single digits. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 210 basis points to 70.9%. This strong performance was driven by favorable mix shifts towards our full price and international businesses, AUR growth and lower cotton costs.\nAUR increased 6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations and on top of a 15% increase last year. Our AUR growth continues to be driven by favorable product, category, channel and geographic mix, along with reduced discounting with minimal like-for-like pricing on moderating cost inflation. Adjusted operating expenses grew 4% to 56.1% of sales, up 60 basis points to last year. The increase was entirely driven by the planned timing of marketing investments. which represented 6.7% of sales, up 100 basis points to last year, supporting our New York City Fashion Show, Milan Presentations, Polo Spring campaign and other key activations globally.\nExcluding marketing, adjusted operating expense rate declined approximately 30 basis points to last year. We continue to expect full year marketing at approximately 7% of sales. And our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 14.8%.\nMoving to segment performance and starting with North America, first quarter revenue declined 4% as continued momentum in Retail was more than offset by planned declines in the wholesale channel. In North America Retail, first quarter comps grew 1% in line with our expectations and including a negative impact of roughly 120 basis points from Easter shifting into Q4. Brick-and-mortar channel comps were up 3%, led by our full-price stores, while digital comps declined 4%. We remain focused on improving the trajectory of our North America digital business as we move through fiscal '25, notably enhancing site experience and improving availability of top-selling core product.\nIn North America wholesale, revenues decreased 13% as expected, reflecting significantly reduced sales of excess product into the off-price channel and receipt timing shifts previously discussed. Excluding the shifts, our full-price sales declined roughly low single digits, in line with our spring season-to-date sellout trends. Our AUR at wholesale increased modestly, consistent with recent trends on well-positioned inventories in the channel.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect North America wholesale declines to moderate through the remainder of fiscal '25 with sellout more closely aligning to sell in, maintaining our ability to chase replenishment on stronger performing core product. Our outlook also includes the planned exit of approximately 45 department store doors this fiscal year, as we continue to proactively evaluate and refine our brand presence on a door-by-door basis.\nMoving to Europe. First quarter revenue increased 7%, this was ahead of our expectations with both wholesale and retail sales outperforming our plan. All key markets delivered growth in the quarter with the exception of the U.K., where retail growth was offset by continued softness in wholesale. Performance in Europe was led by retail, with comps up 8% to last year, including owned digital commerce up low double digits. AUR continued to grow strongly on top of last year's double-digit percentage increase driven by our brand elevation with discount rates down significantly to last year despite a competitive promotional environment.\nEurope wholesale increased 5%, driven by strong reorder rates, notably at our digital partners following last year's channel reset. We continue to expect Europe wholesale channel growth in the low single-digit range for fiscal '25 with Q3 below the full year trend due to the planned timing of shipments as previously discussed.\nWe remain encouraged by our brand's rising consumer perceptions in Europe as well as our team's strong execution, especially given the ongoing dynamic operating environment across the region.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 9% with growth across all markets. Retail comps were also up 9% on top of a 13% increase last year, with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased low double digits on top of an especially strong reopening compare of more than 50% last year. While our 618 holiday sales significantly outperformed the market, we continue to experience normalizing consumer trends post pandemic as reflected in our reaffirmed outlook of low teens China growth this year.\nSales in Japan, our largest market in the region, increased high single digits, supported by key marketing campaigns and a rebound in tourist spending, which returned to pre-pandemic levels this quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows continue to be key enablers of our Fortress foundation, allowing us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We generated about $245 million in free cash, enabling returns of approximately $225 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases this quarter, even as we continue to make important long-term investments in our brand, technology and ecosystems.\nNet inventory decreased 13% to last year, slightly better than our plan. Our inventory levels continue to be well positioned relative to our outlook for each region and heading into the important fall holiday season, with weeks of supply improving versus last year, despite incremental shipment delays related to the Red Sea.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility among other considerations. For fiscal '25, we continue to expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, centering on about 2% to 3%.\nOur outlook continues to include stronger growth in DTC and and caution around the North America wholesale channel where demand is improving, but still challenged. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 150 basis points, driven primarily by Asian FX. Given the structural headwinds we've seen in the Japanese yen over the past few years, we'll be taking select like-for-like price increases in Japan this fiscal year.\nWith regards to this year's revenue cadence, we still expect the first and third quarters to trend below our full year outlook, largely based on the planned timing of wholesale receipts. The third quarter is also impacted by additional factors specific to this year, notably, a shorter holiday selling window between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to last year, and volatility around the U.S. presidential election and potential related impacts on consumer behavior.\nWe continue to expect operating margin to expand about 100 to 120 basis points to a 13.5% to 13.7% range. In constant currency relative to our fiscal '22 Investor Day base period, this keeps us on track to deliver our 15% operating margin target this year. We still expect gross margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by favorable mix shift towards our international and full price DTC businesses, continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting headwinds from incremental labor and other noncotton raw material costs and favorable cotton costs.\nWe successfully renegotiated our annual freight contracts in the first quarter, encompassing the majority of our ocean freight requirements. Based on this visibility, our outlook continues to include minimal impact from freight in the first half of fiscal '25, followed by incremental headwinds from higher spot rates, non-cotton material costs, and labor in the second half of the year, as we called out in May.\nIn addition, we are closely watching the risk of potential additional China tariffs, along with the rest of the industry. We are well positioned following several years of proactive diversification into other supply markets and development of near-shoring capabilities. Currently, China represents a high single-digit percentage of our finished goods coming into the U.S. And for fiscal '25, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact our gross and operating margins by about 40 basis points.\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenues to be up low to mid-single digits in constant currency centered around 3% to 4%, led by our DTC channels. Wholesale is expected to improve sequentially from Q1 as North America sell-in more closely aligns to sell-out trends. Digital trends in Europe are expected to be pressured by the timing of an end-of-season sales shift into Q1. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately 160 basis points.\nWe expect second quarter operating margin to expand approximately 80 to 120 basis points in constant currency with roughly 110 to 130 basis points of gross margin expansion more than offsetting higher operating expenses due to the timing of key marketing campaigns this quarter, including the Summer Olympics and our September Fashion show. We still expect marketing investments to grow at a faster rate in the first half of the year and decline in the second half.\nExcluding marketing, we continue to expect second quarter operating expense to leverage slightly similar to our Q1 trend. And foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin by roughly 40 basis points and operating margin by 50 basis points in the second quarter.\nBased on favorable tax credits realized in the first quarter, we now expect our fiscal '25 tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the full year while the second quarter is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22%.\nIn closing, Ralph's vision of inspiring the dream of a better life is as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago. Resonating with our consumers around the world as well as our teams who proudly and passionately carry this vision forward and continue to execute with agility and dedication. While we are mindful of ongoing volatility and challenges in the broader operating environment, our business continues to be supported by our powerful iconic brand and our multiple drivers of growth across geographies, categories and channels.\nAnd importantly, we remain committed to delivering on year 3 of our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan, while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van Der Ghinst\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We will also be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As we close out year 2 of our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan, we are proud to have delivered strong progress once again on our core strategic and financial commitments. Supported by the incredible dedication and agility of our teams, this year's performance underscores both the strength and resilience of our multi-levered plan.\nIn particular, we drove progress on: first, clearly increasing the desirability of our timeless brand, which is resonating with consumers of all ages and enabling continued pricing power in the market; second, leveraging the breadth and authenticity of our lifestyle portfolio of products; and third, continuing on our long-term strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer channels, which now represent about 2/3 of our total business compared to 55% when I joined the company. This is where we can drive the best expression of our brand and own customer engagement while reducing our exposure to wholesale. All of this is underpinned by our key enablers and culture of operating discipline. These are key differentiators behind our consistent execution, which enabled us to fuel our strategic growth initiatives for the long term.\nWe closed out fiscal year '24 with solid fourth quarter performance, including top line growth and operating margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. For the full year, we delivered 3% top line growth with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driving more than 20% adjusted EPS growth. Results were at the high end of the targets we laid out last May, even with unexpected macro headwinds across several of our key markets throughout the year. This year's performance also puts us firmly on track with our long-term financial commitments and demonstrates continued progress across our 3 strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, elevate and energize our Lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.\nLet me take you through a few highlights from the fourth quarter and year. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our Lifestyle brand. Ralph Lauren is at the intersection of culture, spanning fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music moments, as we expand across geographies and demographics. And our team put our brand at the forefront of the conversation this year. From our iconic runway shows in New York City and Milan, the single-day activations in China, Fortnite gaming partnerships and Taylor Swift on the cover of time. This strong momentum continued through the fourth quarter. Key campaigns included: first, our sponsorship of the Australian Open Tennis Championship in January, which was officially the world's most attended grand slam of all times. Now in our fourth year, the tournament is quickly becoming one of the most iconic events of our sports calendar across social media, our on-court uniforms and off-court spectator style. Our brand was featured on more than 700 celebrities and friends of the brand, including Korean pop sensation, Crystal Young, L. McPherson and Comedian Celeste Barber. This enabled us to significantly extend our brand reach with over 400 million social media impressions globally.\nIn March, we released the second capsule of our groundbreaking Polo Ralph Lauren Artist in Residence campaign, focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. Together, the first 2 capsules featuring Navajo Designer Naiomi Glasses, generated more than 6 billion PR impressions. And the collaboration represented our second highest online search trend of the year. Our Lunar New Year activations across social platforms like Douyin and WeChat, also generated another successful holiday event with high single-digit sales growth significantly outpacing peers and double-digit growth in new customers in China.\nIn the world of gaming, we want to congratulate Ralph Lauren sponsored eSports team, T1, for winning the League of Legends World Championship this year. T1 became the most winning team in gaming history and drove important visibility for our brand as we continue to recruit new younger consumers through exciting digital platforms. We also outfitted iconic celebrities, including Beyonce, on her new Cowboy Carter Album tour and Reba McEntire at the Super Bowl. Both were Radiant in Western Inspired Ensembles, one of Ralph Lauren's signature design codes. And beyond the quarter, we continue to drive excitement across the world of fashion and sports, including our intimate Fall '24 women's collection fashion show here in New York City a few weeks ago. and the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, where we are once again the official outfitter of Team USA, a Cherish partnership since 2008. These activations are driving strong sustainable growth in new customer acquisition and engagement.\nIn fiscal '24, we added over 5 million new consumers to our DTC businesses consistent with our long-term expectations. Our brand consideration, purchase intent, and especially our Net Promoter Scores, all increased to last year, led by next-generation under 35 consumers and women. And we grew our followers on social media by low double digits to last year to over $58 million, led by Instagram, LINE, Douyin and TikTok. Ralph pioneered a company of firsts. From our earliest forays into fashion sponsored sports partnerships to our popular coffee shops and restaurants that drive viral social media engagement. And our teams will continue to drive brand heat and elevation by leading on next-gen platforms and leveraging our powerful new data science models to drive lifetime consumer value.\nMoving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. As the market continues to demonstrate consumers are turning to brands they know and trust and styles that live beyond one season. In addition to our powerful brand, Ralph Lauren has one of the most authentic, recognizable and broad-based portfolios of lifestyle offerings in the world, one that resonates across our diverse customer base and sets us apart from other brands. And Ralph and our design teams continue to create and reimagine beautiful styles that capture the modern consumers changing lifestyle through our unique lens while also embodying the quality, craftsmanship and sophistication that have come to define our brand.\nOur core products, which now represent more than 70% of our business, grew low single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year ahead of total company growth. Performance in core was led by our cable knit, [indiscernible] and Polo Bear sweaters, transitional outerwear, iconic mesh polos, linen shirts and shirt jackets and sophisticated casual sports coats. Our polo player chino caps, as seen on Kendall Jenner and Jennifer Lawrence, are also resonating strongly with existing customers while attracting new next-gen customers as a trend right entry point to the brand. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high potential categories. including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these categories increased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and high single digits for the full year. This strong performance was driven by both outerwear and women's. Women's now comprises about 29% of total company sales, up 100 basis points to last year, and still represents our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Top sellers and women's this quarter included our iconic cable knit and Polo bear sweaters, linen and seasonless Chambre shirts, cable knit polos, lightweight outerwear and short dresses.\nIn addition, this fiscal year, we moved our directly operated furniture business to a highly experienced license partner with proven success in luxury furniture design, production and distribution. While we still see significant long-term growth opportunities for the category, this move will enable us to better serve our own customers and expand the category with elevated products and white glove service consistent with our brand. With the transition now complete, this will enable us to put even more emphasis on handbags at directly operated business as our third high potential category.\nOther exciting releases this quarter included the successful launch of our newest fragrance Polo 67, with a global campaign featuring New York Yankees Captain Aaron Judge and our Lunar New Year year of the Dragon capsule celebrating prosperity and opportunity with both strong AUR and sell-through rates. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement and desirability.\nTurning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world are driving elevation and consistency across all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by a direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, where we offer our most elevated consumer experiences and engagement. During the year, we drove strong DTC comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets. Comps were up mid-single digits in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital channels. Globally, we opened a total of 78 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority in Asia. This includes several iconic Ralph Lauren stores over the past year, notably new stores in Amsterdam, Singapore, Prague and Charlotte, our first TCD ecosystem in Canada, including our first Toronto store and the launch of our Canadian digital flagship, and our first Rouse coffee shops in Paris and Dubai. And we continue to develop and test new concepts, including our latest opening, a new women's Polo store on Cat Street in Tokyo which sits at the epicenter of Tokyo's Street fashion culture with more to come.\nBy region, growth was led by Asia, consistent with our long-term plan, followed by better-than-expected performance in Europe and North America. China was once again a standout with sales up low double digits this quarter over a more normalized post-COVID compare and up 30% for the full year. Our China business has more than doubled versus pre-pandemic levels, now representing 7% of total company sales, with significant growth opportunities still to come. Our expansion remains disciplined as we largely focused on our key city clusters, supported by highly dynamic local marketing and digitally led ecosystem expansion to recruit new customers to the brand, an elevated assortment of high-quality icons that align particularly well with the old money or quiet luxury aesthetic, and the strong continued execution of our local teams.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. Our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter and year. First, as part of our focus on delivering best-in-class digital technology and analytics. Over the past several years, we have embedded a culture of operating discipline, including more rigorous inventory management. To further support this, we started testing our sophisticated predictive buying model in Asia and Europe stores this year. This AI-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improve conversion. Based on the pilot's early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to around 25% of our international DTC businesses in fiscal '25. And as we continue to embed citizenship and sustainability in everything we do, we were proud of the recognitions we received this year, in particular, being named one of Forbes' world's best employers in 2023, a top-rated ESG performer by Sustainalytics, and the best company for women to advance by parity.org for the fourth consecutive year.\nIn closing, Ralph's unwavering vision of authenticity and timeless style is resonating around the world, transcending fashion trends and generations. From the easy elegance of our runways to the incredible energy and thrill of sports partnerships, Ralph Lauren continues to define a luxury lifestyle that is uniquely our own. This year's performance keeps us firmly on the offense, delivering across our multiple drivers of growth, with a plan that is not dependent on any single channel, geography or category. All of this is supported by the dedication, passion and agility of our teams who are executing with excellence to bring our brand to life through our dynamic campaigns and consumer experiences in stores and online. And as we look to fiscal '25, we will continue to drive this brand momentum and consistently execute on our plan, all while investing in our key strategic priorities to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation.\nAnd before I hand it off to Jane to discuss our financial results, you will have seen from this morning's press release that we named Justin Picicci, our new Chief Financial Officer; Jane will continue in the role of Chief Operating Officer through fiscal '25 while ensuring a seamless CFO transition. Ralph and I are incredibly grateful for her leadership and impact in the CFO position helping to guide our company through significant transformation over the past 7 years, and we look forward to continue partnering with Jane as COO. And we're excited to welcome Justin who steps into the CFO role effective today and will join us on our next earnings call. With nearly 20 years at the company, Justin is an experienced leader who has worked closely with Jane and me and successfully served in a range of senior finance roles at Ralph Lauren around the world. Ralph, the Board, Jane and I have the utmost confidence in our ability to deliver together continued strong growth and value creation, building on the foundations we've established.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jane, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nChief Financial Officer, Coach, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '24 was an important year for Ralph Lauren. Our teams executed exceptionally well in what continues to be an uncertain broader operating environment. We delivered on the financial and strategic commitments we laid out over a year ago. We continue to elevate our consumer experiences, products and storytelling, driving both our continued shift towards higher-value consumers in 28 consecutive quarters of AUR growth, and our timeless brand brought truly iconic moments that only Ralph can deliver to our consumers around the world. We achieved all of this while continuing to drive greater efficiencies and invest in our long-term strategic priorities to enable future sustainable growth.\nIn addition, we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year, on track with our Investor Day commitment to return approximately $2 billion through fiscal '25. And this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend for fiscal '25.\nLet me take you through our financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company fourth quarter revenue growth of 3% exceeded our expectations, driven by continued strength in DTC and better-than-expected sequential improvement in wholesale. This year's earlier Easter contributed around 50 basis points to Q4 results as planned, but will negatively impact next quarter. By region, Asia once again led our performance with sales increasing high single digits. North America grew 2% and Europe was up slightly, both ahead of our expectations. Total company comp increased 6%, led by strong performance across brick-and-mortar channels, total digital ecosystem sales, including owned sites and wholesale digital accounts grew mid-single digits, supported by strong results in our owned and pure-play sites in Europe. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 510 basis points in the quarter and 210 basis points for the full year. This was significantly above our outlook, driven by low double-digit AUR growth, lower freight expense and favorable channel and geographic mix for both the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter promotions were lower in all 3 regions, helped by lower end-of-season inventories following our strong holiday sell-throughs.\nCotton costs had a neutral impact on fourth quarter gross margin. As previously indicated, cotton will ramp into a tailwind in fiscal '25 and '26 after 2 years of cost pressures. We still expect healthy AUR gains this year, driven by our growing brand desirability, ongoing product mix elevation and favorable geographic and channel mix. However, we expect AUR growth to rely less on like-for-like pricing as cotton costs moderate. Adjusted operating expenses grew 5% to 57.9% of sales up 90 basis points to last year. The increase was primarily driven by investments in talent and marketing. Marketing was 7% of sales, up from 6% last year to support key brand moments, delivering continued momentum in our brand health metrics, notably our Net Promoter Scores. Full year marketing was also 7% of sales, in line with our annual guidance. Adjusted operating margin expanded 410 basis points for the quarter and [indiscernible] basis points for the full year.\nMoving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to last year as stronger growth in retail more than offset a 2% decline in wholesale. In North America Retail, fourth quarter comps increased 3%, led by mid-single-digit comp growth in our brick-and-mortar stores. Key actions we took in the first half of the year continued to benefit our outlet performance, including improved staffing, selling environment and product presentation. Our outlet AUR increased double digits with lower discount rates to last year.\nIn our digital channel, comp trends were softer, but AUR increased as expected, following a stronger Q3 holiday period. In North America wholesale, revenues declined 2%, a significant improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year. Our sellout also improved sequentially, down low single digits, aligning more closely to sell in this quarter, while AUR in the channel increased to last year. We continue to manage our wholesale business carefully into fiscal '25, given broader channel headwinds, including regular assessment of our brand presence on a door-by-door basis. We are planning for North America wholesale declines to moderate from fiscal '24 levels with Q1 and Q3 trending below our full year expectations based on timing of wholesale shipments.\nMoving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased slightly ahead of our expectations. Results included about 3 points of negative impact from the timing of wholesale deliveries, including rerouting of shipments from the Red Sea. Performance was driven by retail comps up 12% on top of a strong 8% compare last year with double-digit growth in both our brick-and-mortar stores and digital sites. While the competitive environment remained highly promotional, our elevated brand positioning and growing brand desirability delivered double-digit AUR growth with further reductions in discount rates. Europe wholesale declined 8% to last year, including about 5 points of headwinds from a shift in timing of wholesale deliveries as well as lower off-price sales due to cleaner inventories coming out of the holiday. Similar to Q3, we drove strong growth in wholesale reorders particularly due to restocking at our largest pure-play account. For the full year, Europe wholesale declined low single digits.\nLooking to fiscal '25, we expect underlying growth in the channel to improve to a more normalized low single-digit levels with some continued quarterly choppiness from the timing of shipments, while our Europe business performed better than expected through the year and sell-out trends are encouraging, we remain cautious into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 7%, with growth across all markets. Asia retail comps were up 6%, with strong growth in both digital and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased low double digits on top of an unusually strong reopening compare of 40% last year, including another successful Lunar New Year event. All of our other key markets, Japan, Korea and Australia also grew during the fourth quarter and full year on top of strong compares.\nMoving to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow continue to be key enablers of our Fortress Foundation. They allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We generated exceptionally strong cash flow in fiscal '24, with more than $900 million in free cash flow, exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory was healthy. 14% lower than last year and well below our revenue trends. The reduction was better than our plan following stronger-than-expected sell-through rates over the holiday. As we enter fiscal '25, inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook for each region.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, potential supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '25, we expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits centering on about 2% to 3%.\nOur outlook continues to include stronger growth in DTC versus caution around the wholesale channel, where demand is improving but still challenged. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 90 basis points, driven primarily by Asian FX. Asia is still expected to lead our growth, up high single digits and on track with our targeted 3-year algorithm. This is followed by Europe up approximately low single digits and North America up slightly. Q1 and Q3 revenues are expected to trend below our full year growth outlook based on planned timing of wholesale receipts in both quarters and lower Q1 excess sales in North America and Europe. We expect operating margin to expand about 100 to 120 basis points to 13.5% to 13.7%. In constant currency relative to our fiscal '22 Investor Day base period, we are on track to deliver our 15% target this year. We expect gross margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by favorable cotton costs improving as we move through the year, further mix shift towards international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting headwinds from incremental labor costs. The Red Sea disruption is currently expected to be a modest headwind on top of an otherwise neutral freight environment. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact fiscal '25 gross and operating margins by about 30 basis points. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be up slightly in constant currency, with stronger trends in retail, offsetting timing headwinds in wholesale. This includes about 50 basis points of negative impact from the Easter shift. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points. We expect first quarter operating margin to expand approximately 60 to 80 basis points in constant currency with roughly 140 to 180 basis points of gross margin expansion more than offsetting higher operating expenses which are weighted toward the first quarter due to the timing of marketing activations, notably the fashion show. Foreign currency is expected to have roughly 40 basis points of negative impact on both gross and operating margin in the first quarter.\nWe expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the full year and roughly 24% to 25% for the first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $300 million to $325 million, in line with our long-term outlook of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes preliminary investments around our upcoming multiyear systems implementations, which include consolidation into a single global ERP, integrated business planning tools and enhanced logistics automation. These initiatives will enable a fundamental transformation in our end-to-end processes as we become a more global DTC-oriented company and greater efficiencies across demand planning, inventory buying, allocations and more. We currently anticipate about half of the project will be capitalized with annual CapEx remaining well within our long-term guidance range, and we expect to exclude the non-capitalized portion of the project spend from our adjusted earnings outlook, given the significant and unique nature of this large-scale multiyear transformation project. We will provide additional details as we finalize our plans in fiscal '25.\nIn closing, through this second year of our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan, our teams continue to execute with excellence and are truly embodying Ralph's vision of inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life. And as we continue to navigate an uncertain global environment, we remain laser-focused on our strategic priorities, our commitments and driving what we can control. For the past 7 years, it has been a privilege to be a part of Ralph's enduring and timeless vision and Patrice's transformational leadership. I am immensely proud of what the team has accomplished over this time, including delivering on our commitments, consistently and steadfastly creating a culture of agility and operational excellence and establishing a significantly more elevated brand and a profitable foundation for growth. And with these strong foundations in place, I am excited to have Justin step into the role of CFO. We Justin is an accomplished leader with a track record of success over his long tenure at Ralph Lauren. And I have every confidence Justin and our talented team will continue to elevate our iconic brand, build our foundations and drive continued value creation.\nAs this is my last earnings call in the CFO role, I want to thank all of you in the financial community for your support, your engagement and for challenging us to consistently be better.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. This holiday quarter, our campaigns around the world celebrated a season of giving, marked by warm, reflection and comfort that inspires people to dream of the best things in life and share them with those they love. Immersing people in our world of easy elegance and sophistication has epitomized Ralph Lauren over 57 years. And we continue to deliver this quarter after quarter to an ever-expanding audience to our next great chapter accelerate plan. This combination of magic and logic translated to strong financial performance in the third quarter, our biggest quarter of the year. With top and bottom line results that exceeded our expectations, along with significant EPS growth.\nAs we continue to navigate a dynamic global operating environment, our teams remain keenly focused on what we can control. This starts with our timeless and highly desirable brand which is resonating with consumers all around the world and enabling continued pricing power in the market. Our ability to leverage a broad powerful portfolio of core products that we can flex with evolving consumer needs. Our continued deliberate shift toward our direct-to-consumer channels where we can best deliver our elevated and connected consumer experiences and which once again led growth in the quarter. And all of this is underpinned by the agility and operational discipline we have built into our business so that we can continue fueling our strategic growth initiatives for the long term.\nAs we outlined at our last Investor Day, we are strongly encouraged that we have built a sustainable and resilient model with multiple diversified drivers for long-term growth and value creation. Our third quarter performance was a clear example of how we're driving progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these areas.\nFirst, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to harness the power of our iconic brand as we expand across geographies and demographics, cutting through culture across fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music moments. During the third quarter, key campaigns included: first, our holiday season for dreaming activations in every region generating nearly 8 billion global impressions. These included immersive holiday gifting content, unique key city takeovers across New York, Shanghai, London and Berlin. And our Singles Day stream in China. Second, our Polo Ralph Lauren Artist and Residence campaign featuring Navajo Designer, Naiomi Glasses, which is the first in a series of groundbreaking partnerships focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. This campaign was not just a galvanizing cultural moment for our organization, but also resonated strongly with consumers, driving more than 3 billion impressions and our highest engagements ever on TikTok.\nWe also outfitted an incredible roster of inspiring women including America Ferreira, Jody Foster, [ Gredeley ] and JLo at the L Women in Hollywood event. [ Janome Monet ] and [ Kate Bach ] at Art Basel in Miami. And Gauravi Kumari, Princess of Jaipur for a high-profile fundraiser at the dazzling city palace in Jaipur, India. And who could forget Taylor Swift, who chose an all-American Ralph Lauren look for the cover of Time magazine as their 2023 Person of the Year.\nThese activations helped to fuel our strongest quarter of new consumer acquisition and brand affinity since the pandemic. We added 1.7 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, up high single digits to last year, driven by all regions. Our Net Promoter Scores accelerated along with positive momentum in brand consideration and purchase intent. And we grew our followers on social media by low double digits to last year, led by TikTok, Instagram, WeChat and Douyin.\nMoving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that live on beyond one season. And this holiday was no exception. As Ralph and our design teams seamlessly married sophisticated casual with styles excluding the luxury and glamor of the season. Our iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew low double digits in the quarter, ahead of total company growth. From our Mesh Polos and Oxford Shirts, to our luxuriously soft Cashmere Sweaters and versatile Blazers, we have established a broad and highly recognizable portfolio of icons that drive our business through both choppy and more stable times alike. And we are incredibly proud of the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing to drive newness and excitement behind these styles, so they appeal to our most loyal and new consumers alike.\nPerformance in core was led by our cable knit sweaters in cotton woolen cashmere, quilted and down jackets and sports coats in the range of tweed, [ tartan platt ], stretch corduroy and party ready velvets. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high potential categories, including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits to last year.\nThis was led again by women's, our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Driven by an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens. Performance was supported by our cashmere, flag and polo bear sweaters, sophisticated wool and cashmere coats, blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit tools and cocktail and evening dresses. Other special releases this quarter included our Polo Country and Element Skateboards Capsule a limited edition collection of unisex Polo Country styles and Element Skateboards celebrating the great outdoors. We sold over 2,000 skateboards, highlighting the lifestyle reach of our brand, and appeal to younger consumers. Our limited edition Polo ID handbag collaboration with Mr. Bags in China, which sold out within one minute on WeChat. Our innovative love of the land collaboration with Navajo Designer, Naomi Glasses; Ralph Lauren's first artist in residents. And the annual and much loved Ralph Lauren Pink Pony collection supporting Ralph's 30-year commitment to cancer care and research. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement, and desirability.\nTurning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and deliver consistency through all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, which combined already represent about 2/3 of company sales. During the quarter, we drove accelerated comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets.\nGlobally, we opened a total of 17 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority again in Asia. While comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by the continued improvement in our outlet trends. The key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from our optimized staffing to assortment enhancements and emphasis on quality and value, served us well through holiday and will continue to be drivers as we look ahead.\nIn addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including our new emblematic store at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, the first door to offer our luxury collections in Southeast Asia. Our first Ralph Lauren store in the Czech Republic, in Prague's historic old town as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina; and our first Ralph's coffee shops in Paris and the UAE. We also launched our Ralph Lauren digital flagship site in Canada, following our Toronto store opening last quarter. Combined with our elevated wholesale presence, these are helping us introduce a cohesive connected retail experience to our consumers across the Canadian market.\nBy region, growth was again led by Asia with particularly strong performance in China, where sales increased more than 30% this quarter on both comp and new store growth. This was ahead of our expectations, even with last year's easier compares due to the surge in COVID cases. We are still in the earlier stages of brand building in China with meaningful outperformance versus peers in the quarter on consumer KPIs, including brand awareness, consideration and Net Promoter Scores. Our team delivered another successful Singles Day focused on brand building with ralphlauren.cn sales up 25% on lower discounting and higher AURs to last year. Our early performance to date on Douyin has also been very encouraging following our limited launch last fall with an expanded rollout this spring.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As we drive towards best-in-class digital technology and analytics, we tested our sophisticated predictive buying model in our European and Asian stores this quarter. With our initial rollout limited to select sweaters, knit tops and caps, this artificial intelligence-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improve conversion. Based on this early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to an expanded range of categories and markets over time.\nAs we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability to future-proof our business, we are also proud to be named once again one of Forbes World's Best Employers in 2023.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's excellent execution through this important holiday season. This quarter's performance reinforces how the power of our iconic brand, together with our multi-lever strategy delivers. We are firing on multiple cylinders while not dependent on a single geography channel or category for growth. And this model, combined with our unique agility and the remarkable dedication of our teams is what will continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through these dynamic times. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nChief Financial Officer, Coach, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We entered this holiday season with a clear game plan. We invested in brand momentum around the world, expanded giftable core and seasonal products to delight our consumers and drove key operational improvements and flexibility to mitigate near-term macro headwinds. This quarter's strong performance was a testament to the agility of our teams and the resilience of our next great chapter accelerate plan, coupled with the power and global reach of our iconic brand.\nWe reported third quarter revenue, adjusted operating profit and double-digit EPS growth above our outlook. And we achieved this while continuing to strengthen our brand proposition around the world and investing in our key strategic priorities to enable sustainable growth into the future. Top line exceeded our guidance, driven by comp acceleration in DTC with momentum in all retail channels globally. Operating margin expansion was also ahead of our outlook despite our strategic investments and ongoing cotton headwinds as we focus on operating with discipline in an evolving global environment. And we returned approximately $425 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date, in line with our long-term guidance.\nLet me take you through our third quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Our accelerating brand momentum and investments in key holiday campaigns resulted in 5% total revenue growth. This was above our outlook led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and holiday outperformance in Europe. Revenue in North America was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations. Each of our DTC channels contributed to top line growth in the period, with total DTC penetration expanding approximately 400 basis points to last year. adding stability and resiliency to our business, consistent with our NGC strategy.\nTotal company comp increased 9%, accelerating sequentially across all three regions. Ralph Lauren stores continued to lead our global performance. Our positive outlet comps continued to improve following investments in service and expanded core product assortments, driving solid traffic AUR and basket size growth in every region. Comps in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites increased 8% on top of 11% growth last year as we prioritize ongoing investments to expand our footprint and improve the customer experience online. Total digital ecosystem sales were also up high single digits, including a strong recovery in Europe as our largest pure-play account returned to growth. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 66.5%, reflecting our long-term elevation work. This was consistent with our outlook, driven by lower freight expense, favorable channel and geographic mix and 9% AUR growth.\nThese more than offset ongoing cotton cost headwinds and targeted promotions to drive conversion during key holiday sale periods. Cotton costs will start to abate at the end of our Q4, beginning with our spring 24 collections. As previously indicated, we are planning a moderation in AUR growth based on a reduced need to pass like-for-like cost inflation onto the consumer. Nevertheless, we plan to continue driving positive AUR increases as a result of our growing brand desirability ongoing product mix elevation and favorable geographic and channel mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 50.2% of sales a 100 basis point increase to last year. The increase as a percent of sales was driven largely by channel and geographic mix shifts in the quarter. With our DTC and international businesses contributing a significantly higher share of sales in the period versus last year.\nThis quarter's strategic investments focused on our key city ecosystems, marketing investments and enhancing the consumer experience and service levels across our DTC channels. Variable selling expenses also rose as a result of stronger retail sales growth. Marketing was 7.5% of sales, up slightly from last year to support our high-impact holiday activations, delivering improvement across our consumer metrics, including brand consideration, Net Promoter Scores and purchase intent. We still expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales.\nMoving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenue was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations as stronger growth in retail was offset by our reduced sell-in to the wholesale channel. In North America Retail, third quarter comps increased 5%, led by a double-digit increase in our Ralph Lauren stores. Our outlet performance continued to improve with positive comps driven by our product elevation and our recent interventions to improve the selling experience and retail environments.\nDespite taking targeted promotions during the key holiday periods, our outlet AUR increased strongly and discount rates declined versus last year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site were up 4% on top of 9% growth last year. In addition to a strong response to our Black Friday event, recent site enhancements such as upgraded search and navigation drove higher conversion in the quarter.\nWe also launched our Canadian digital site in the quarter. In North America Wholesale, revenues decreased 15%, in line with our expectations as we proactively focus on aligning inventory with softer demand trends. We continue to evaluate our brand presence in each store and exited approximately 20 department store doors this year. While we plan to manage this channel carefully into calendar '24, we were encouraged by our improving sellout trends, which meaningfully outperformed our sell-in this quarter. Our AUR in the channel was also up on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving on to Europe. Revenue increased 6%, with performance led by our DTC channels. This was above our expectations as strong growth across the continent more than offset continued consumer and macro headwinds in the U.K. results included roughly 5 points of negative impact from the earlier timing of wholesale deliveries and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Retail comps increased 11% on top of a strong 11% compare last year with similar performance in our brick-and-mortar and digital sites.\nWe drove strong momentum across brands and categories in Europe, with growth led by gifting, seasonal sweaters and outerwear, which are AUR accretive. Europe wholesale was approximately flat to last year, but included about 11 points of net headwinds from unusual impacts of wholesale allowances and earlier receipts. Strong underlying growth was supported by wholesale reorders, which returned to more normalized trends in the quarter, following recent destocking at digital wholesale accounts.\nWhile our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first three quarters of the year we remain cautious on the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 17%, with double-digit growth across our largest markets of Japan, China and Korea. Asia retail comps were up 14% with strong growth in both digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased more than 30% on continued brand momentum, including successful Singles Day events as we lapped last year's COVID impact. Third quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. Overall inbound tourism recovered to prepandemic levels. Although Chinese travelers to Japan are still down 70%. Sales in Korea also rebounded to low double-digit growth, benefiting from our recent marketing activations and a shift in the timing of the Chuseok holiday from Q2 last year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory decreased 15%, below our revenue growth trend with units also down double digits. The decline was driven by stronger-than-expected Q3 sales and our continued efforts to ensure healthy wholesale inventories.\nAs we transition into spring, we believe overall inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook for each region. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with healthy inventories below prior year levels with an improved ability to chase into potential demand as a result of our predictive buying model.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, potential supply chain disruption and foreign currency volatility among others.\nFor fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, now centering on about 2% compared to our previous outlook of 1% to 2%. Our outlook continues to embed caution around the wholesale channel where year-to-date demand has been softer than prior year. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit revenue growth by about 10 basis points. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin.\nWe now expect gross margin expansion in the range of 140 to 180 basis points in constant currency, up slightly from 120 to 170 basis points previously. This is driven by favorable freight costs, further mix shift toward international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full year cotton inflation.\nGross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset expense deleverage due to mix shift and key strategic investments. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to increase in a range centered around 2% in constant currency, with stronger trends in retail versus continued caution in wholesale in both North America and Europe. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points.\nWhile we remain cautious on North America, we expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 with stronger trends in DTC offsetting continued softness in wholesale. In Europe, fourth quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the earlier timing of wholesale shipments. Excluding this impact, we expect underlying trends in Europe to increase slightly in Q4. And in Asia, we anticipate growth will be closer to our full year guide for the region of up low double digits. As we lap a more normalized compare following the easy COVID compares in Q1 and Q3.\nWe expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 350 to 400 basis points in constant currency. Largely driven by gross margin expansion with about 40 and 50 basis points of negative foreign currency impact on our operating and gross margin, respectively. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% for the full year due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q3 and roughly 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter. And capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $200 million to $225 million.\nIn closing, Ralph's vision has always been about inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life. And this holiday quarter was no exception. We are proud of our team's strong execution on our next great chapter accelerate plan through what continues to be a highly dynamic operating environment. We are focused on what we can control, shifting to GTC, harnessing big data and AI and of course, operating and balance sheet discipline. This puts us in a position of strength as we continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van Der Ghinst\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to 1 per caller.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call.\nWe continue to deliver solid progress on our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan in the second quarter. Through an uncertain global macro environment, our iconic brand and timeless products continue to resonate with consumers all around the world. And our multiple engines of growth across categories and regions, enable our teams to deliver against our strategic and financial commitments even in a choppier backdrop.\nSecond quarter results exceeded our expectations on the top and bottom line. We were particularly encouraged by an acceleration in our retail performance with positive comps across every region and channel in the period. The strength and growing desirability of our brand is underpinned by our continued pricing power, with AUR up another 10% on top of 18% growth last year.\nIn addition, consistent with our plan, we continue to focus on balance sheet and expense discipline. This is fueling our investments in high-impact brand moments spanning geographies and demographics, all while delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. Looking ahead, as the important holiday season gets underway, we are executing on our long-term game plan and keenly focused on what we can control.\nWe are elevating our brands and positioning in the marketplace while staying grounded in the realities of the macro environment. With more than 6 consecutive years of AUR growth, a cumulative increase of over 70%, we are confident in our pricing power in the market.\nNow it's important to remember that AUR growth is an output of our overall elevation work that has included evolving our product categories, product mix and shopping experiences in addition to promotional pullback. This fundamental reset in our pricing architecture gives us the flexibility to continue driving our long-term brand elevation while also reacting with agility to near-term inflationary pressures.\nTurning to the second quarter. Our performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.\nLet me take you through a few highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to invest in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic lifestyle brand. The Ralph Lauren brand resonates across geographies and demographics, powerfully cutting through a wide range of cultural moments, across fashion, music, gaming, sports and more.\nSome highlights from the quarter included: first, September marked our return to New York Fashion Week with a rustic romantic show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard where Ralph and our design teams presented a women's show highlighting our brand's quintessential easy elegance and relaxed refinement. Supported by our activations across 25 key markets and influential guests from JLo and Caradelavin to Libingbing and Sofia Richie Grange, we drove 24 billion impressions globally with outsized growth in our luxury perception ratings in North America.\nNext, we reinforced our brand leadership in the world of sports with our sponsorship of the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and Ryder Cup. Our brands showed up powerfully on the courts and green and on celebrities and influencers, enjoying sport in our iconic spectator style. We also continue to innovate in the world of gaming to engage new and younger consumers, launching our latest partnership with Fortnite.\nRace to Greatness immerses players in a unique experience, blending luxury fashion, gaming and exploration. Engagement exceeded our expectations with over 0.5 million unique visitors to the experience and the live stream activation reaching 2 million total views.\nIn China, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of our cult classic Double RL brand with an immersive 2-day event with VIC celebrity and influencer attendees featured in a motorcycle tour around Chengdu City, horseback riding and vintage collection storytelling. Other celebrity highlights from the quarter included dressing Beyoncé in her Renaissance World Tour; and Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence both spotted in effortless Polo looks on the streets of New York.\nTogether, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new high-value consumers to our business. We added 1.3 million new consumers to our GTC businesses in the second quarter, consistent with recent trends. And this continues to skew increasingly towards next-generation under 35 consumers. We reached 55.9 million social media followers globally, a low double-digit increase to last year with unique activations across line, TikTok and our recent launch [indiscernible] driving engagement. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers globally. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more.\nIn uncertain times, consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond 1 season. timeless classics have always been our core proposition. And Ralph and our design teams continue to deliver with an unwavering focus on the quality and quiet luxury that are central to our way of living.\nOur iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew high single digits in the second quarter, ahead of total company growth and core penetration to sales increased by roughly 500 basis points, underscoring the importance and resilience of our icons through choppy times.\nStrong performance in our core was led by our iconic cable knit sweaters in cotton and cashmere, jackets and vests, heritage and unconstructed sports coats. Our kids business improved sequentially this quarter, led by girls with strength across seasonal fall sweaters, dresses, outerwear and baby gifts.\nOur core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits in the quarter. We continue to drive strong growth in women's, our most significant long-term opportunity on an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens.\nSimilar to men's, performance was supported by our core icons this fall, including sweaters, garden die shirts, versatile mid- and full-length skirts taking her from day to night and our iconic blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit fabrications.\nIn the second quarter, we also launched our most comprehensive women's handbag campaign to date with the introduction of our newest icon, the RL 888 With a 360-degree launch across key cities, we are establishing the category in a way that is authentic to our brand with a focus on quality Italian craftsmanship and leathers expressed in Ralph Lauren's elegant aesthetic.\nOther special releases this quarter included our sports sponsorship collections with U.S. Open and Wimbledon sales significantly outperforming our expectations. Our limited edition P-Wing Fortnite Sneaker-Boot, which is now reselling to collectors for up to 4x the retail price, and in September, together with Rizzoli, we launched a Way of Living, a stunning hardcover book celebrating Ralph Lauren's signature home collections over 40 years.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to create excitement and desirability in addition to driving customer loyalty. On to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and connection through all of our consumer channels and touch points.\nEach of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, which already represent about 2/3 of company sales. Our strong retail comps this quarter were supported by continued momentum across both core Polo products and luxury collections. In our precision engagement with consumers who have the potential for long-term loyalty and outsized lifetime value.\nWhile comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by improved performance in our outlet business. also positive in every region. Key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from assortment changes to optimize staffing and highly targeted promotions appealing to our more value-oriented consumers, position us well as we head into holiday.\nIn addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including Marina Bay Sand in Singapore and renovated experiences in Brussels and Stockholm. And in North America, we're excited to build our first ever key city ecosystem in Canada, starting with Toronto, where we opened our first Ralph Lauren store at Yorkdale Center this quarter.\nAnd just a few weeks ago, we launched our Canadian digital commerce site, ralphLauren.ca, helping us deliver connected retail experiences to our consumers across the market. Globally, we opened a total of 16 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities this quarter with the majority again in Asia, particularly in China.\nOur performance in China remains a standout with sales up more than 20% this quarter. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by strong brand momentum and high-quality new consumer recruitment. Looking ahead, we still see significant opportunities to drive our business with global Chinese consumers.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. Within our best-in-class digital technology and analytics capabilities, we enhanced our RalphLauren.com digital flagship and app this quarter. This included new search capabilities and improved navigation which helped deliver a more personalized experience and drive conversion.\nWe also continued our early testing of generative AI. For example, leveraging the technology to create select product descriptions on our digital site. As we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability into our business, we're excited to share that we signed a collective power purchase agreement to scale our purchasing of solar power in Europe.\nThis initiative created by the fashion pack brings us 1 step closer to reaching our goal to power our direct operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2025. And just a few weeks ago, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation announced our newest Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention at USC's Norris Cancer Center Hospital. This center will represent our third center in the U.S. and our first 1 on the West Coast. As we continue our efforts to improve access to high-quality cancer screening services and treatment for underserved communities.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are proud of our team's progress creativity and dedication while navigating a dynamic environment. As we enter holiday and the second half of the year, we remain focused on what we can control as we deliver on our multiple levers for growth across regions and categories.\nOur strengthening brand desirability, sustainable pricing power, and consistency of execution, continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through challenging times and underpinning all of our growth opportunities is the enduring power of our iconic lifestyle brand, which continues to inspire people all over the world to step into their dreams.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nChief Financial Officer, Coach, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We drove second quarter results ahead of our expectations while making strategic growth investments that will continue to support our business in the second half and in the long term.\nSecond quarter revenue growth exceeded our guidance driven by better-than-expected performance in our DTC channels in North America and Europe, along with continued momentum in Asia, led by China. Gross and operating margins were also above our outlook despite ongoing cost headwinds and high levels of strategic investments in the quarter as planned.\nOur continued brand elevation, favorable channel and geographic mix shifts, coupled with our focus on cost savings and productivity fueled our investments in sustainable long-term growth. Leveraging our strong cash flow, we delivered approximately $275 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date.\nWe are on pace with our long-term shareholder return commitments while maintaining our fortress balance sheet 1 of our key enablers that serves us well through times of uncertainty. With this discipline, we entered the holiday season with clean and healthy inventories. With our elevated brand clear strategy and targeted investments, we are proud of the progress we are making on our multiyear Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan.\nWe remain committed to both our fiscal '24 outlook outlined back in May and our 3-year targets, while recognizing that we are still operating in a highly volatile environment. Let me take you through our second quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Total company revenues in the second quarter increased 2% led by double-digit growth in Asia.\nRevenue in North America and Europe declined slightly to last year, with Europe impacted by timing shifts as noted on our last call. Total company comp increased 6%, with all 3 regions delivering positive comp growth in the period, led by our Ralph Lauren stores and digital Notably, our outlet comps improved with both stronger traffic and stabilizing conversion trends.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 65.4%. This was better than our outlook as strong AUR growth, lower freight expenses and favorable channel and geographic mix more than offset ongoing pressure from higher cotton costs. We continue to expect stronger gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as cotton headwinds start to moderate and inventories remain clean and well positioned.\nAUR increased 10% on top of 18% growth last year with balanced growth across all regions and channels, driven by our long-term strategy of brand and product elevation. This more than offset targeted promotional activity in the quarter focused on driving conversion with our value-sensitive consumers. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% to 55.5% of sales, driven by this year's cadence of higher marketing, talent to support our strategic growth areas, and long-term investments in our key city ecosystems, notably in-store customer service, new digital site launches and search engine upgrades.\nMarketing was 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We continue to expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales, consistent with our long-term guidance, including a more normalized growth in the second half. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Second quarter revenue declined 1% ahead of our expectations with stronger growth in our retail business offset by expected wholesale declines in a softer environment for the channel.\nIn North America Retail, second quarter comps increased 4%, representing a meaningful improvement over our first quarter trends. Comps were positive in every channel, including outlet, which started to benefit from our recent interventions to strengthen the customer experience and selective promotions to drive conversion with value-oriented consumers.\nComps in our owned RalphLauren.com site grew 4%, a 12-point improvement from Q1 and as we continue to drive personalization and targeted marketing activations. All DTC channels delivered at least mid-single-digit AUR growth alongside these comp improvements. In North America Wholesale, revenues declined 7% to last year, in line with our expectations as we carefully manage sell-in to the channel to align with softer consumer demand.\nWhile this channel is also experiencing some challenges related to macro inflation pressures, we are encouraged that our top 100 doors are significantly outperforming the rest of the fleet, following our targeted investments in renovations and service levels. In addition, our wholesale AUR continued to grow, up mid-single digits on product mix elevation and controlled inventory levels.\nLooking ahead, we are maintaining a cautious outlook on the channel and remain focused on aligning inventory levels to demand. Moving on to Europe. Revenue declined slightly in the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. Results included 5 points of negative impact from the earlier timing of fall '23 wholesale deliveries into the prior quarter and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances.\nRetail comps increased 6% with owned digital commerce up 14% and brick-and-mortar comps up 5% on similar performance in Ralph Lauren and outlet stores. Europe AUR increased high single digits in the quarter. Digital comps were higher than our expected full year run rate as new sites accelerated growth.\nSimilar to North America, we added targeted incremental seasonal promotions to drive conversion, which meaningfully benefited Q2. We Conversely, we expect Q3 digital comps to be negatively impacted by a calendar shift in Boxing Day sales to Q4. We Europe wholesale declined 7% to last year, in line with expectations, including approximately 9 points of headwinds from the items noted previously.\nLooking ahead, these drivers are expected to negatively impact our Q3 and Q4 growth by about 12 and 4 points, respectively. Turning to Asia. Revenues increased 13%, with growth led again by China. China sales increased more than 20% on top of a strong compare of more than 30% last year on continued brand momentum.\nSecond quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. We expect continued momentum in Asia in the second half of the year, with growth in China outpacing the rest of the region. Within our other nonreportable segments, licensing revenue declined high single digits, in line with our plan. The transition out of our Lauren men's suiting license as a part of our long-term elevation journey drove the entire decline and will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of fiscal '24.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times.\nWe ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventories declined 5%, aligned with our expectations and below our revenue growth trend with units down high teens. Inventories decreased double digit in North America, on a more normalized timing of receipts and cautious top line outlook for the region.\nInventories in Europe also declined in constant currency, while Asia levels reflected our strong expected growth rates. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with inventory below prior year levels. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment.\nThis includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds and foreign currency volatility, among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, centering on a range of 1% to 2%.\nOur outlook embeds slightly increased caution around the wholesale channel, where year-to-date demand has been soft. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact reported revenues by about 50 basis points due to unfavorable shifts in both Asian and European exchange rates versus our prior outlook.\nWe continue to expect top line growth to be led by Asia, followed by low single-digit growth in Europe. And we still expect a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends in the first half and wholesale timing shifts in Q1. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%.\nForeign currency is expected to have roughly 10 basis points negative impact on full year operating margin. We expect gross margin expansion in the range of 120 to 170 basis points in constant currency, up from about 100 basis points previously. This is driven by more favorable freight costs, mix shifts towards international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full year cotton inflation.\nGross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset higher operating expenses as we invest in key strategic initiatives, particularly around digital, Key City ecosystem expansion, marketing and sustainability. Relative to our Investor Day base period, guidance still implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant on track with our long-term targets.\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% in constant currency, led again by Asia. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 30 basis points. We remain cautious on North America and expect similar trends to Q2 with softness in wholesale offsetting stronger trends in DTC.\nIn Europe, third quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the timing of earlier fall shipments and from lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Excluding these unusual impacts we expect underlying trends in Europe to be more in line with our full year outlook for the region of low single-digit growth.\nWe expect third quarter operating margin to be roughly flat in constant currency with about 10 basis points of foreign currency benefit. We expect constant currency gross margin expansion of 100 to 150 basis points, largely offset by a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments planned in the second quarter and third quarter of the fiscal year.\nWe now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the full year and roughly 23% to 24% for the third quarter and capital expenditures are expected to be around $250 million. In closing, our year-to-date performance demonstrates the agility of our teams to deliver continued strong execution, along with progress on our Next Great Chapter Accelerate plan, led by Ralph's enduring vision our teams around the world are consistently driving brand desirability with products and experiences that resonate across generations, geographies and lifestyles.\nEven as we navigate near-term challenges, our multiple engines of growth, along with our Fortress foundation, put us in a position of strength to continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corina Van Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van Der Ghinst\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Horn's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructinos]\nDuring today's call, our financial performance will be discussed on a constant currency basis. Our reported results, including foreign currency can be found in this morning's press release. We will also be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nOur expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice.\n\nPatrice Jean Louis Louvet\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nThank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We started year 2 of our next great Chapter Accelerate plan with continued progress on our long-term strategic commitments. Our solid first quarter performance highlights both the power of our iconic brand around the world and our diversified engines of growth.\nFirst quarter results exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line in what continues to be a highly dynamic global operating environment. We delivered positive comps, stronger value perception and luxury credentials and targeted ecosystem expansion across our top cities in the period.\nOur growing brand desirability also drove double-digit AUR growth on top of last year's strong gains. And we will continue to invest in our product quality and sustainability, selling environments and authentic brand messaging to sustain our growth and long-term pricing power in the marketplace. At the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on agility and operational discipline to respond to evolving market dynamics. This enables our operating profit and margin expansion even as we invest for the long term.\nWe continue to be mindful of macro inflationary challenges facing our more value-oriented consumers, particularly in North America. That said, we are more than offsetting softness from this cohort with growth in our full price businesses.\nTurning to the first quarter. Our solid performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.\nLet me take you through a few highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We are investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand to inspire and engage our consumers, drive brand desirability in the market and ultimately grow lifetime value. We continue to diversify and optimize our marketing across a variety of media and platforms as we deliver a clear, differentiated story to our target consumers in order to trade them in, across and up our lifestyle portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, first, we drove some of our highest engagements globally through iconic celebrity dressing moments. This was led by Jennifer Lopez at the Met Gala in May, delivering over 8 billion global media impressions and her look landed on multiple best dress lists across TV, digital, social and print outlets. Other celebrity highlights included Taylor Swift, spotted on the streets of New York in our Wellington bag and all white Polo Ensemble; Singer and Acress, Crystal Young in Cannes. First lady, Jill Biden at the Coronation of King Charles. And you may have caught a recent episode of, And Just Like That, which features characters Charlotte and Rock, outfitted in Ralph Lauren at a fun fictional polo photo shoot, highlighting the multigenerational appeal of our brand.\nSecond, we have worked to reinforce our luxury lifestyle positioning through iconic lifestyle partnerships and activations in key global cities. We paired our recent Milan flagship openings with key campaigns to fuel excitement in this influential fashion capital this spring. This included the return of men's Purple Label to Milan Fashion Week in June and our second annual participation at Salone del Mobile, part of Milan Design Week, where we showcased our emerging home business.\nSimilarly, across Europe and Asia, we drove brand heat through experiential events like our California Dreaming key city takeovers, exclusive private client events and influencer campaigns to build our presence in both new and existing ecosystems from Paris to Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul.\nAnd most recently, we reinforced our leadership in the world of sports with another successful Wimbeldon sponsorship, where we delivered our highest ever results on social conversations on-site merchandise sales and global PR impressions. Ralph Lauren truly embodies the heritage and tradition of this iconic tournament. In addition to our beautiful Encore presence, we also captured our iconic spectator style on celebrities and influencers like Ariana Grande and David Beckham, which we amplified globally. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new high-value consumers to our business.\nIn our DTC businesses, we added 1.2 million new consumers in the first quarter consistent with recent trends. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers. And we reached 53.5 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to outpace our peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories.\nMoving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Ralph and our design teams continue to create sophisticated timeless products that meet our customers' modern lifestyle, underpinned by the quiet luxury that is a hallmark of our brand.\nStarting with our iconic core products, which typically represent about 70% of sales and are a consistent driver of our business, season after season. Our core grew mid-single digits in the first quarter, ahead of total company growth and penetration to total sales increased by 350 basis points. underscoring the importance and resilience of our icons through choppier times. This was led by our iconic cable knit sweaters and cardigans, linen shirts and chinos, double net sweatshirts, rugby shirts and tailored suit separates.\nWe continue to see evidence that consumers are turning to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond 1 season. Our roots in quality and timeless style remain a competitive advantage in this context, supporting our strengthening value proposition. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits in the quarter.\nWomen's, our largest long-term opportunity, continues to outpace total company performance, supported by our Spring '23 California Dreaming collection inspired by the natural beauty, optimism and glamor of the West Coast, Polos, day dresses and lightweight skirts in seasonal florals and silks, newer wide-like bottoms and encouraging growth in our Polo ID handbags.\nOther special releases this quarter included the launch of our Polo Mirum sneaker, our first luxury sneaker that is 100% plastic-free. Leveraging our investment in natural fiber welding, Mirum is made with an innovative combination of natural rubber, Hutton, court and plant oil. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles.\nSwitching to our third key initiatives, winning key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We remain committed to developing our key city ecosystems around the world, with a focus on elevating and connecting all of our consumer touch points across every channel. At the same time, we are clearly pivoting our business toward direct-to-consumer which already represents about 2/3 of our sales.\nOur investments in high-quality new customer recruitment and increasingly elevated distribution are working. Our full-price retail channels led the growth in the quarter, consistent with recent trends. This is helping to mitigate near-term inflationary headwinds facing a subsegment of more value-sensitive consumers. Our positive retail comps were supported by continued momentum in our core Polo products and luxury collections, along with improving foreign tourist sales and successful clienteling by our decaded sales teams. This performance more than offset continued pressure in our outlet comps, which were challenged by a more promotional North American market.\nWe opened a select number of iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, notably in Amsterdam, Tainan and Kuala Lumpur, featuring an elevated assortment and prime luxury adjacencies. These stores are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers. We opened a total of 28 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly in China.\nChina sales accelerated to more than 50% growth with easier compares following last year's Shanghai lockdowns. We were particularly encouraged by our strong 6/18 performance, which outpaced peers and reinforced our new customer acquisition in the market. And over 40% of our transactions were generated from new consumers. Looking ahead, we still expect China to remain 1 of our fastest-growing markets.\nWithin our digital businesses, sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce were flat this quarter. Strong growth in our international markets more than offset declines in North America, where the digital channel has also become more promotional. This quarter's digital performance was clearly below our long-term targets, and we implemented key interventions during the quarter, which will continue into the fall season. Encouragingly, we started to see improvement in our North America digital trends from June onward, as Jane will discuss in a moment.\nAnd finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As part of our ongoing work to deliver superior operational capabilities, we are implementing process improvements and new tools to streamline our value chain and drive long-term margin opportunities.\nOur recent work has resulted in a 25% reduction in our overall Spring '24 SKU count, even as we continue to develop our high-potential categories. Within citizenship and sustainability, we were proud to be recognized as a top-rated ESG performer by Sustainalytics as we work to embed sustainability in all we do. And within our people and culture, we were recently named a best company for women to advance by parity.org for the fourth consecutive year.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's solid start to this fiscal year. We continue to focus on offense, agility and pragmatism in these dynamic times. And we believe Ralph Lauren is firmly in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments. Underpinned by Rob's timeless vision and the strength of our iconic brand, we have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with consumer needs, and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation from our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nChief Financial Officer, Coach, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid start to fiscal '24, with first quarter results ahead of our expectations. This quarter's performance demonstrates the broad-based strength of our strategy and the agility of our teams in a highly dynamic global operating environment. This gives us confidence in delivering on both our long-term commitments as well as the fiscal '24 outlook we outlined in May.\nWe drove positive first quarter revenue growth, exceeding our guidance. We returned to gross margin expansion this quarter with clean inventories, all while overcoming peak raw material costs and our culture of cost discipline enabled us to deliver 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 13.7%, with operating profit dollars up 9%.\nWe continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including roughly $100 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases this quarter. Our first quarter financial performance underscores our position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter.\nTotal company revenues in the first quarter increased 1% above our outlook. Strong performance in Europe and Asia more than offset a decline in North America, which was negatively impacted by a wholesale timing shift into the prior quarter, as noted on our last call. Our digital ecosystem sales were about flat with growth in international offsetting a decline in North America.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus last year to 69.3%. This was above our outlook, driven by lower freight expense and 15% AUR growth, along with favorable channel, geographic and product mix. The cost of raw materials, notably cotton, continued to be a headwind in the quarter as expected.\nLooking ahead, we plan to continue leveraging price to offset cost inflation, which will moderate this fall from peak spring '23 levels. As a reminder, our long-term approach to AUR continues to be a multipronged strategy driven by product mix elevation, more personalized and targeted promotion, select like-for-like increases based on competitive benchmarking, disciplined inventory management to limit excess and favorable geographic and channel mix shifts.\nWe expect these drivers to continue delivering positive, albeit a more modest level of AUR growth longer term. Adjusted operating expenses increased 40 basis points to 55.6% of sales in the first quarter. Marketing was 6% of sales compared to 7% last year. As noted on our last call, we are shifting a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments into the second quarter of this fiscal year, driving expense deleverage in Q2, and However, we continue to expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales, consistent with our long-term guidance.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenues decreased 10%. This included about 5 points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption, as previously noted. The rest of the decline was largely driven by continued inflationary pressures on our more value-oriented consumers.\nIn North America Retail, first quarter comps declined 6%, following a 5% increase last year. We continued to deliver strong growth in our Ralph Lauren stores while performance was softer than expected in outlet and digital. In our channels with exposure to value-oriented consumers, notably outlet, inflation continues to pressure consumer spending and the competitive set has grown increasingly promotional.\nOur North American digital business was also pressured in April and May. However, we delivered improved trends toward the end of June, as we implemented key actions to improve our sales and conversion in the channel. Looking ahead, we expect to drive modest sequential improvement in our retail business through the rest of fiscal '24. We have proactively adjusted our Fall '23 buys to focus on our core.\nWe are launching new digital enhancements as well as our Canada digital flagship this fall. And we are making key investments in personalized communication and leveraging selective promotions to drive conversion and keep inventories healthy. These actions remain consistent with our initial guidance for fiscal '24.\nIn North America Wholesale, revenues decreased mid-teens to last year. The return to a normalized cadence of spring deliveries had a 12-point negative impact on our growth in the channel this quarter. Our wholesale AUR increased 11% as we continued to elevate our product mix while keeping our wholesale inventories clean. We remain cautious on the channel through the rest of this year on softer reorders and broader challenges in the channel.\nMoving on to Europe. First quarter revenues increased 7%. While this was ahead of our expectations, the first quarter included a roughly 5-point benefit from earlier timing of Fall '23 wholesale deliveries. Retail comps were up 2% on top of a strong 34% compare last year, which benefited from a sales resurgence post-Omicron. Brick-and-mortar comps rose 1%, led by Ralph Lauren stores. Europe AUR increased mid-teens in the quarter.\nOur Europe's digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by an 8% comp in our own digital commerce and the wholesale timing shift, which also benefited our digital accounts. Europe wholesale increased 11%, driven by the earlier fall shipments. While this timing shift will negatively impact our wholesale sell-ins by an estimated 4 points in both Q2 and Q3, respectively, it should also position us well to capture full price sales in season.\nAside from the wholesale timing shifts, we are maintaining our full year fiscal '24 Europe outlook of low single-digit growth reflecting our continued caution on the macro environment and digital wholesale channel.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 18% with growth across each of our key markets. led again by China. China accelerated to more than 50% growth as we lap significant COVID-related restrictions in the prior year period. Our brands demonstrated strong momentum during the Golden Week and 6/18 Festival. First quarter sales in Japan increased high single digits despite a slow recovery in inbound tourism and our continued near-term caution on the market.\nWithin our other nonreportable segments licensing revenue declined high single digits, in line with our plan. The decline reflects the previously disclosed transition out of our Lauren Men's suiting license as part of our broader brand elevation strategy. The exit will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the fiscal year until we lap it in fiscal '25.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We are tightly controlling our inventory levels and driving efficiencies with net inventory up 1% this quarter, in line with our top line growth. Increases in Asia and Europe were largely offset by a high single-digit decline in North American inventories. We expect second quarter inventory growth to continue moderating, which should position our brands well ahead of the important holiday season.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds and foreign currency volatility among others.\nFor fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact reported revenues by about 20 basis points due to unfavorable shifts in Asian exchange rates versus our prior outlook. We continue to expect top line growth to be led by Asia, up double digits, following by low single-digit growth in Europe. We still expect a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends in the first half and wholesale timing shifts in Q1.\nWe continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin to expand about 100 basis points with reduced freight costs favorable geographic and channel mix and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting cotton inflation.\nGross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset higher operating expenses as we invest in the key strategic initiatives outlined at Investor Day, particularly around digital and key city ecosystem expansion as well as marketing and sustainability. Relative to our Investor Day base period, guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets.\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to slightly up in constant currency, led by growth in Asia. We remain cautious on North America, but expect sequential improvement following Q1's negative timing shifts. Conversely, we expect second quarter Europe and digital ecosystem sales to be sequentially weaker, both due to the earlier fall shipments reported in Q1. Excluding the shift, we expect underlying trends in Europe to be more in line with our full year outlook for the region of low single-digit growth.\nWe expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 9% to 9.5% in constant currency and 9.5% to 10% on a reported basis. We expect constant currency gross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points to be more than offset by higher operating expenses due to the timing of strategic investments as previously indicated. This includes key digital ecosystem and marketing investments, notably the shift of our fashion show into the second quarter from the third quarter of last year.\nFrom a cadence perspective, our outlook implies stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by our merchandising actions, marketing activations for fall holiday and the investments just noted. In addition, we will start to lap negative inflationary impacts from the second half of last year. We continue to expect operating margins to expand in Q3 and Q4 and for the full year on both a reported and constant currency basis. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the full year and roughly 21% to 22% for the second quarter. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million.\nIn closing, inspired by Ralph's enduring vision. Our teams around the world continue to demonstrate agility and dedication every day as we execute on our next great chapter, Accelerate plan. While we remain acutely attuned to the near-term challenges facing certain areas of our business, we believe in our strategic priorities, investing in lifelong consumer relationships, leveraging our powerful core products in high potential categories and developing our key city ecosystems. These priorities, combined with our passionate teams, put us in a position of strength to continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van Der Ghinst\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2023 Conference Call.

Reconciliations can be found in this morning's press release.\nDuring today's call, we will also be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guaranteed, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice.\n\nPatrice Jean Louis Louvet\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ralph Lauren Corp.\n\nThank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. When we met last September here in New York, we outlined our ambition to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company and build a business that lives up to the potential of our powerful brand.\nAs we close out the first year of our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan, we are particularly proud of the progress we have made on our strategic commitments in pursuit of this goal. Our teams around the world executed exceptionally well through a highly dynamic global operating environment to deliver another quarter and full year of strong performance. We over delivered on the top line this year with 10% constant currency growth, supported by all 3 regions. This included positive comps, further AUR growth, and brand-accretive ecosystem expansion across our top 30 cities.\nAt the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on productivity and operational discipline. This is enabling us to fuel our long-term initiatives and also grow our profitability on a constant currency basis. As we called out at the beginning of fiscal '23, the global environment has been and continues to be choppy. Throughout this, our teams are demonstrating agility and flexibility to respond to evolving consumer demand and market dynamics.\nAs we continue to drive our strategy of long-term brand elevation across every region and channel, overall, our performance this year underscore the general resilience of our core consumer, and growing desirability of our brand around the world. This translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth globally, even as we took targeted actions to keep our inventories clean and well positioned.\nWe are well aware that a subset of our consumers who are more value-oriented are increasingly pressured by macro and inflationary headwinds. We expect these trends to persist in the near term, particularly in North America and Europe. While this demographic still represents a relatively high average household income, they are being more choiceful with their apparel dollars and seeking more value.\nIn this context, we believe consumers will look to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. In this environment, our roots in quality and timeless style are a competitive advantage and our growing brand desirability and value perception across all demographics support this.\nTurning to the fourth quarter, our successful performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few of the highlights across each of these strategic pillars.\nFirst, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We remain committed to investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand, to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of Ralph Lauren. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. Our value perception increased, while our lifetime consumer value grew high single digits for both the fourth quarter and full year as we focus on trading consumers in, across and up within our lifestyle portfolio.\nIn the fourth quarter specifically, we drove a diverse range of brand activations underscoring the unique Ralph Lauren Lifestyle. First, we continue to strengthen our leadership in the world of sports, with our annual sponsorship of the Australian Open. Now in our third year, we significantly outperformed our plan on both sales and media impressions as we successfully leveraged our Encore presence as well as our authentic partnerships with celebrities and influencers globally.\nOur Lunar New Year activations across Asia included our successful Polo Bear campaigns with WeChat and Kakao, helping to drive 13% growth in social followers in the region, led by tenfold growth on [ Don ]. At the Oscars in March, we were proud to outfit social activist and Noble Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai in a custom Ralph Lauren collection silver sequence gown. This iconic moment resonated with consumers, garnering over 8 billion media impressions globally. And as we continue to reinforce our leading position in gaming and the metaverse, we partnered with Web3 community Poolsuite as part of our Miami ecosystem launch this spring. The immersive experience included exclusive digital Ralph Lauren outfits and our first ever NFTs co-designed with Poolsuite members.\nTogether, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new full-price consumers to our business. In our DTC businesses, we added 1 million new consumers in the fourth quarter for a total of more than 5 million new consumers this year, consistent with our targets. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers with whom we also drove our largest increase in luxury perception over the past year.\nWe reached 52 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by dynamic content on Instagram, TikTok, Weibo and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven once again by our core categories.\nMoving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Our goal of becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company starts with our unique brand positioning in the market, which stands for so much more than a single product or category. It stands for the dream of a better life. From elevated hybrid dressing to quiet luxury, Ralph and our creative teams are delivering sophisticated, timeless products to serve our consumers across their modern lifestyles.\nStarting with our iconic core products, which represent about 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season. Our core grew low double digits in the fourth quarter, led by our spring-ready [ cable ] knit sweaters, Polos, Oxford shirts, chino shorts, relaxed tailoring and [ silt ] blend shirts and day [ dresses ]. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include Women's, Outerwear and our emerging Home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter.\nWomen's, our largest long-term opportunity continued to strongly outpace total company performance. Our Accelerate plan focuses on trading her into the brand across categories and up to more elevated styles to drive lifetime value, with women's AUR up more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our continued strong Women's performance was supported by strong growth in handbags as well as our global launch of Women's Polo intimates in March with a particularly strong start on ralphlauren.com. Other special releases this quarter included our Creed III movie collaboration featuring 6 limited edition looks worn by Michael B. Jordan in the film and account exclusive capsules targeted towards next-gen consumers, including our retro varsity release with [ ASOS ], Polo Boxing Club collection with [ Musinsa ], in Korea and icons in [ Madras ] with [ Beams ] Japan.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles.\nSwitching to our third key initiative, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem. We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Starting with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased high single digits in constant currency this fiscal year.\nIn the fourth quarter, our Asia digital ecosystem delivered the fastest growth globally. With our owned and wholesale digital channels, both contributing to 40% growth in the quarter. We were particularly encouraged by our strong Lunar New Year performance, which significantly outpaced peers, including Women's up more than 60% and continued elevation with double-digit AUR growth.\nAs part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 21 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter. With the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland. We are strongly encouraged by our continued brand momentum in China following the countries reopening.\nThrough 3 years of COVID disruptions, our teams worked with agility to build our brand presence in the market. And this year's outstanding performance was a testament to those efforts. We drove full year China sales up more than 20% in constant currency, including an acceleration in fourth quarter sales up over 40%. Looking ahead, we expect China to remain one of our fastest-growing markets. We opened 2 iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in Asia this quarter in Shenzhen [ Luo ] Mall and [ Pitch Street ] in Sydney, representing the most elevated expression of our brand to date in Australia. And here in North America, we opened a new store in Miami's Design District, showcasing the modern elegance and exceptional craftsmanship of our luxury collections. All 3 of these iconic stores are parts of the top 30 cities we highlighted at Investor Day. They are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers.\nAnd finally, touching briefly on our enablers, in addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. Some of the achievements we were particularly proud of this year included: the launch of our first cradle-to-cradle certified product with our luxury gold cashmere sweater, being part of Fortune's world's most admired companies, moving to #2 from #6 last year for our sector and Fast Company's 2022 Brands That Matter List for a collaboration with [ Morehouse and Spellman ] Colleges.\nAnd finally, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation's $25 million grant to fund 5 cancer centers in the U.S., including our newest center in Georgetown, which opened just a few weeks ago.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are inspired by our team's performance this year, putting the company in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments even through a volatile consumer backdrop. And as the global environment remains highly dynamic, our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism remains the backbone of our approach moving forward. This year's progress on our Accelerate plan demonstrates that we have the right plan in place even as we face a more pressured environment. We have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with the consumers' evolving needs and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation from our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline.\nAnd of course, all of this is underpinned by the strength of Ralph's timeless vision and our iconic brand, which continues to invite people all over the world to step into their dreams. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nChief Financial Officer, Coach, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by this year's progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan, which remains on track even with numerous macro challenges that our teams have faced this year. We leveraged our strong brand, multiple strategic growth drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver strong financial results in a dynamic environment.\nFor the full year, we delivered 10% revenue growth in constant currency, exceeding our guidance with growth in every region. We expanded operating margin and grew profits ahead of top line growth in constant dollars, consistent with our 3-year plan. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 13.7% in constant currency, with operating profit dollars up 15%. Our continued brand elevation and culture of cost discipline were key to our strong results and provided flexibility to more than offset softer gross margins as we focused on keeping inventories clean and well positioned in the marketplace.\nOperating with discipline will continue to be an important element of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to manage changing market dynamics and fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth. And we continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including more than $650 million this year in the form of our dividends and share repurchases.\nExiting the year, we remain confident in both our strategic direction and our fortress foundation enablers, which are allowing us to drive our strategic initiatives even through times of uncertainty. Our full year and fourth quarter financial performance underscored this position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some highlights from the quarter.\nTotal company revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9% in constant currency, above our outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia. Results included about 180 basis points of negative headwind from the shift of the post-Christmas sales week into the fiscal third quarter from our fourth quarter last year, as previously noted. Our digital ecosystem sales declined mid-single digits in constant currency. Q4 performance included lower European pure-play results as planned, following exceptionally strong performance last year coming out of the pandemic.\nSales in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew mid-single digits on top of 20% growth last year. As we continue to elevate this channel, our digital AUR grew mid-teens and our full price sales penetration increased meaningfully to last year. We plan to enhance the user experience with rich digital content and even greater customer personalization in fiscal '24.\nIn addition to the AI machine learning capabilities, we've been utilizing for areas such as inventory optimization, forecasting and consumer engagement, we've started to leverage our early learnings to test generative AI across multiple areas of our business from copy editing and graphics to computer programming.\nTotal company adjusted comparable gross margin was about flat in constant currency, in line with our guidance. Tailwinds from product mix elevation, AUR growth of 12% and lower air freight were offset by peak levels of raw material costs, notably cotton, targeted promotions to drive conversion with our more value-oriented consumers and keep inventories healthy and higher [ dues ] in Europe.\nFinally, freight turned to a 100 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter compared to an 80 basis point headwind for the full year. Despite cost turbulence, our adjusted gross margins are tracking ahead of fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels and were 170 basis points higher in the fourth quarter and 320 basis points higher for the full year.\nAdjusted comparable operating margin was 6.1% in constant currency or 390 basis points increased to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 380 basis points to last year in constant currency. Marketing was 6% of sales on a more normalized cadence of planned spending compared to 10% in the prior year period. Full year marketing was 7% of sales, in line with our annual guidance as we continue to invest in key brand moments and innovative new platforms. Adjusted operating profit grew approximately 200% in the quarter.\nMoving to segment performance. The shift of post-Christmas sales from Q4 last year into Q3 this year had a disproportionate impact on both North America and Europe's fourth quarter results, particularly our retail channels. This shift represented about a 270 basis points of headwind to revenue growth in North America and 120 basis points impact on Europe.\nStarting with North America. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%. Stronger wholesale growth was partially offset by retail headwinds. In North America retail, fourth quarter comps declined 4% on top of a strong 21% compared last year. Similar to recent trends, strong growth in our full-price stores was offset by softer performance in outlet and digital. North America retail AUR increased another mid-single digits on top of a robust 20% growth last year, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts around product, distribution and marketing. This helped to mitigate targeted promotion focused on our more value-oriented consumers. Looking ahead, we expect the subsegment of consumers to remain more sensitive to near-term inflationary pressures and this is reflected in our continued caution through fiscal '24.\nBeyond these headwinds, we are confident in the region's long-term trajectory which was reinforced by improving North America brand health metrics this past year with our strongest growth in brand awareness, perception of value for money and luxury perception.\nIn North America wholesale, revenues grew low double digits to last year as we return to a more normalized cadence of spring deliveries following last year's supply chain disruptions. This benefited our Q4 by about 12 points, and we'll have a roughly 13-point negative impact on our first quarter wholesale growth. Adjusting for the normalized shipment cadence, this implies underlying wholesale revenue flat to last year, similar to Q3 trends. Our wholesale AUR increased high single digits to last year as we continue to elevate product and take market share at key partners. The promotion cadence at wholesale was flat to last year, in line with our expectations.\nMoving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 8% on top of a 77% post-COVID reopening comp last year. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 9%, driven by positive growth in both full-price stores and outlets, while digital comps grew mid-single digits. Europe AUR increased double digits in the quarter with strong growth across channels.\nEurope wholesale grew 3% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations. However, we remain cautious on the channel into fiscal '24 on softening reorder rates and digital pure-play performance, consistent with our previous comments.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 29% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations with broad-based growth across each of our key markets led by China. China rebounded strongly to more than 40% growth in constant dollars following the loosening of the Zero COVID policies in the previous quarter, with consumers traveling domestically for the first time since the start of the pandemic.\nOur brand continues to show momentum following a strong Lunar New Year holiday. Korea and Japan also grew double digits on compelling assortments and brand engagement and as Japan lapped last year's COVID states of emergency.\nDespite meaningful COVID disruptions and foreign currency headwinds through this year, we delivered our highest ever operating profit in Asia in fiscal '23. This is a testament to the growing desirability and momentum of our brand, along with the agility of our teams as they continue to drive our key city ecosystem strategy across the region.\nWithin our Other segment, licensing grew low single digits this quarter, slightly above our plan with encouraging results from our [ Chaps ] license and Polo Women's intimates launch. Looking ahead, we will fully transition out of our Lauren Men's suiting license in fiscal '24. While this will negatively impact our licensing revenues and overall company margins by about 20 basis points in fiscal '24, the move is consistent with our brand elevation strategy.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our fortress foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended this year with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We returned $653 million in the form of our dividends and share repurchases this year, consistent with our long-term targets.\nNet inventory increased 10% with growth moderating significantly on a sequential basis as we reduced goods in transit and return to a more normalized lead times following last year's supply chain disruptions. Inventory growth still reflects higher product costs and our ongoing strategy of product mix elevation. Inventory units declined approximately 5% to last year, and are healthy as we enter fiscal '24.\nThat said, we continue to manage our inventory positions carefully, with the majority of our products still weighted to core and seasonless product that can be flexed with demand.\nLooking to fiscal '24, we expect inventory levels to continue to moderate through the year and ending below prior year levels.\nLooking ahead, our outlook contemplates a more pressured consumer spending environment, dynamic macroeconomic conditions and foreign currency volatility, among others. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. We are taking a pragmatic approach to our plan for this year which assumes continued momentum in the full-price channels and Asia, balanced with a more challenged value consumer backdrop in North America and Europe.\nWith an intense focus on what we control from our core iconic products and continued investments in new consumer acquisition to judicious inventory planning and operating expense discipline, we remain committed to driving progress on our long-term growth and profitability trajectory despite the dynamic global environment. Importantly, we expect to deliver both revenue growth and margin expansion this year.\nFor fiscal '24, we are guiding constant currency revenues to increase low single digits and foreign currency to benefit reported revenues by about 20 basis points. We currently expect growth to be led by Asia, up double digits followed by low single-digit growth in Europe and a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends and Q1 wholesale timing shifts. We expect operating margin to expand approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%, driven by gross margin expansion of about 50 to 100 basis points.\nForeign currency is expected to benefit operating margin by about 10 basis points this year. Relative to our Investor Day base period, this guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets. We expect gross margin to benefit from lower freight costs, continued AUR growth and favorable product, geographic and channel mix this year. Reduced freight costs are expected to benefit gross margin by at least 100 basis points this year. We expect these tailwinds to be partially offset by about 20 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, along with continued pressure from product costs, notably cotton, through the majority of the year.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to up slightly in constant currency. On a reported basis, including 150 basis points of currency headwind, we expect revenues to be down slightly. First quarter also includes approximately 220 basis points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption noted earlier. The timing shift is expected to negatively impact our North America growth by about 5 points and North America wholesale growth by about 13 points before returning to more normalized trends in Q2.\nWe expect first quarter operating margin expansion of about 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. We expect gross margins to be driven by lower freight, positive AUR growth and lower wholesale mix, partially offset by higher product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact both operating and gross margins by about 50 basis points in the quarter.\nFrom a cadence perspective, we currently expect operating margin to decline in Q2 due to the timing of planned marketing and ecosystem investments and expand again in Q3 and Q4 to last year. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and roughly 23% to 24% for the first quarter. And lastly, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million, in line with our long-term guidance of 4% to 5% of sales.\nIn closing, led by Ralph's enduring vision, our brand continues to inspire consumers across every geography. Our dedicated passionate teams around the world are operating with commitment and agility to execute on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst.

(Operator Instructions)\nDuring today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of better-than-expected performance, including through the important holiday season. All 3 regions contributed positively to revenue growth and at the same time we made strong progress on the strategic priorities we outlined last September in our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.\nWe have multiple levers of growth and a broad lifestyle portfolio of products. Combined with the agility muscle our teams have built over the last several years, this puts us in a position of strength to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company even amid macro uncertainty. A key element of this strategy is our commitment to brand and product elevation as we have demonstrated over the past 5 years and we're doing all this while maintaining flexibility to respond to consumer demand and market dynamics.\nThis translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth even as the broader marketplace became more promotional, as anticipated. We also continue to drive a culture of operating and cost discipline, which enabled us to meet our operating margin targets in the period. As our guidance reflected from the start of this fiscal year, the global environment has been choppy. We are encouraged that our core consumer has remained generally resilient, which reflects the growing desirability of our brand. At the same time, we continue to watch our more value-oriented customers and channels carefully. In this environment, we are taking a pragmatic approach to merchandising, pricing and inventory planning.\nAs we navigate ongoing macro uncertainties, we remain steadfast in driving our 3 strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem.\nLet me take you through a few of our third quarter highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to invest in our most powerful asset, our timeless luxury brand and way of life to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately, drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of our brand. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. In the third quarter, we drove a diverse range of both global and localized brand activations, showcasing the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We kicked off the quarter with our California Dreaming fashion show at the Huntington Library in L.A. This represented our first ever show on the West Coast, where we had historically been underdeveloped and have an opportunity to scale our presence. From there, we launched into holiday with our Gift of Togetherness campaign, featuring friends of the brand like Shalom Harlow and Tyson Beckford. Our local flagship events range from a family-friendly pop-up skating rink in Ginza to live musical performances at Bond Street in London. These campaigns leverage our authentic brand values around family and togetherness combined with unique localized engagement to excite and delight our consumers around the world.\nFor Polo lovers, we offered our 7 Days 7 Drops on our POLO-67 fan app with a limited edition collection of custom-made skis, vintage ski jackets and collectible posters from the RL archive.\nIn Asia, we drove another successful Singles Day event, ranking #2 for men's apparel and #4 for women's apparel on Tmall. The campaign included our first-ever Tmall cat-faced logo collaboration, generating billions of impressions across online and offline channels in China's key cities.\nAnd as we continue to lead in gaming and the metaverse, we launched an innovative collaboration with Fortnite, targeted to next-gen consumers with additional exciting partnerships to come for spring and fall '23. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting younger full-price consumers to our business.\nIn our DTC businesses, we added 1.6 million new consumers this quarter consistent with recent trends. We exceeded 51 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year, led by double-digit growth on Instagram. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven by our core categories.\nMoving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Across our organization, we are committed to becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company globally. This starts with the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing every day to offer sophisticated, timeless products that meet the needs of our consumers across their modern lifestyles.\nRalph Lauren has a unique positioning in the marketplace that has enabled our brands to thrive over 50 years. Our brand stands for much more than a single product or category. It invites our customers to step into their dream of a better life.\nAt the heart of our business is our collection of iconic core products, which represents 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season. Our core products grew high single digits in the third quarter, led by sweaters, seasonal core knits, sweatshirts and suit separates.\nOur core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's, outerwear, and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter. Women's represents our single largest long-term opportunity for market share gains and category growth as a company. We are trading her into the brand across categories to drive lifetime value and up to more elevated style with women's AUR up 12% in the third quarter. Highlights from the period included our dedicated head to toe holiday campaigns for both Polo Women's and Lauren, including the expansion of our Polo ID bags in new seasonal fabrications.\nOther product highlights and special releases this quarter included the official launch of our Polo Originals line, elevating the upper tier of our core brand with high-quality AUR enhancing styles that pay homage to Polo's roots, our exclusive Navy and Gold Logo Collection capsule with influential Japanese retailer BEAMS, and our Fortnite collaboration with core icons featuring the new Lama player logo and our Polo Stadium collection of digital and physical products. Through these dynamic times, we continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to give consumers what they want as their lifestyles evolve. This enables us to flex from stay-at-home sweatshirts to return to work outfits, to wedding dresses and evening-wear.\nSwitching to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world in the third quarter with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Starting with digital. Third quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, Departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased high single digits in constant currency.\nOur Asia digital ecosystem once again delivered the fastest growth globally. This included another strong Singles Day with double-digit new customer acquisition and sales, significantly outperforming our peers even as we grew AUR by 28%. Within our own digital sites, sales grew low double digits globally in the third quarter. As part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 55 new stores in concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland.\nOur brand momentum and opportunities in China remains strong. We reported third quarter Mainland sales up high single digits in constant currency. This was an encouraging result in light of widespread COVID disruptions following the relaxation of zero COVID policies in the period with over 90% of our stores impacted by full closures, reduced trading hours and staffing levels.\nAs our dedicated teams on the ground continue to manage near-term disruptions with agility, we expect the countries reopening to be a net-positive as we continue to strengthen our growing presence in this key market. Elsewhere in the region, we continued to drive double-digit constant currency growth across Japan, Korea, Australia and Southeast Asia, where we opened our first Ralph's Coffee experience in Kuala Lumpur this quarter.\nIn addition to our sustained momentum across Asia, we remain bullish on our long-term growth opportunities and ability to strategically drive lifetime value across North America and Europe. In Q3, we opened our largest children's store in the world on Via della Spiga in Milan. Located across from our flagship, we are now able to showcase the full breadth of our luxury lifestyle proposition in this important market.\nWe also launched our first full-price emblematic store in Barcelona, another influential fashion market as we continue to build our connected ecosystems across the region.\nAnd finally, touching briefly on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. In the third quarter, we were proud to be recognized on SaaS Company's 2022 Brands That Matter list for our collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges launched last March. This groundbreaking partnership was just one example of our commitment to evolve how we portray the American dream in the stories we tell and the faces and creators we champion.\nWe were also recognized as one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies, moving from #6 last year to #2 this year for our sector. And on the sustainability front, we highlighted our first cradle-to-cradle certified product just a few weeks ago with our luxury gold cashmere sweater. A first-of-its-kind luxury product to achieve this global standard, this is just one part of our commitment to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly. This sweater is the first of 5 iconic products that we plan to make C2C certified by 2025.\nIn closing, our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year underscores our consistency and strong execution. This is underpinned by the power of our brand and Ralph Lauren's multiple drivers of long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Ralph and I are proud of our team's continued agility, execution and productivity as we effectively navigate a dynamic global operating environment. Our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism continues to inspire our approach moving forward.\nAnd I just want to take a moment to welcome our newest Board member, Wei Zhang, former President of Alibaba Pictures and SVP of Alibaba Group, who joined us this quarter. Her leadership experience across international business development, focusing on China, entertainment, media and corporate social responsibility make her a unique addition to our Board.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nCFO & COO, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by our strong early progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We leveraged our multiple strategic drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver third quarter results ahead of our expectations. We drove another quarter of solid topline growth, with Q3 revenues up 1% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency above our outlook. All 3 regions delivered positive revenue growth on both, on reported and constant currency basis as well as positive retail comp growth. Operating margin was at the high end of our guidance with strong expense discipline more than offsetting lower-than-expected gross margin. Operating with discipline has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth.\nExiting the quarter, we continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which has served us well through times of uncertainty. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and Fortress Foundation enablers put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation.\nLet me take you through our third quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 7% in constant currency, above our low to mid-single-digit outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia and Europe. Guidance and results included a timing shift with the week between Christmas and New Year's moving back into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year due to the 53rd week in fiscal '22. This benefited this year's Q3 sales by about 130 basis points, which should negatively impact our smaller fourth quarter by an estimated 170 basis points.\nRalph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew high single digits in constant currency and more than 40% on a 2-year stack. With our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew 10% on top of more than 30% growth last year. We continue to elevate and expand the breadth of our offering online while enhancing the user experience with a rich digital content.\nWe are also driving further improvements in quality of sales with an increase in full price sales penetration and digital margins strongly accretive to our overall profitability in the quarter. Note that the fiscal quarter shift benefited our own digital sales by about 2 points in Q3 and should negatively impact Q4 by about 3 points. We continue to deliver gross margin expansion in constant currency this quarter consistent with our long-term guidance. Total company adjusted gross margin was 65.2%, down 80 basis points to last year on a reported basis, but up 80 basis points in constant currency. The increase was driven by product mix elevation with AUR up 10% on top of 19% growth last year and lower air freight reliance following last year's supply chain disruptions.\nWhile we continue to drive our long-term brand elevation strategy, gross margins were below our expectations this holiday driven by: first, targeted outlet promotions in North America to drive conversion with our value-oriented consumers; second, stronger-than-expected post-Christmas sale days, which shifted into the third quarter from Q4 last year; and finally, higher duty costs in Europe. Compared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, adjusted gross margin was still 300 basis points higher in the third quarter.\nOur better-than-expected revenues and operating expense discipline in the third quarter also enabled us to deliver operating margins at the top of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin was 16% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, representing 190 basis point constant currency increase to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 1%, including a marketing expense decline of 8% over last year's disproportionately back half-weighted spend. Marketing was 7.3% of sales compared to 8.1% in the prior year period. As Patrice mentioned, operational excellence remains a key element of our Fortress Foundation, and we remain sharply focused on operating expense discipline even as we continue to invest behind our brands and targeted global expansion to drive long-term sustainable growth.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenues grew 1% as stronger direct-to-consume performance more than offset a slight decline in wholesale, as anticipated. The shift of post-Christmas days benefited our performance by about 190 basis points in the quarter. This shift should negatively impact our fourth quarter sales by about 270 basis points. In addition, the absence of last year's 53rd week is expected to negatively impact North America by another 460 basis points in Q4.\nIn North America Retail, third quarter comps grew 2% on top of a strong 38% COVID reopening compare last year. While we were encouraged by another quarter of positive comp growth in our full-price stores, this was offset by softer performance in our outlets as anticipated in our guidance.\nOur outlet AUR was up high single digits, reflecting our ongoing brand and product elevation in the channel. However, we continued to see softness in our value-oriented consumers. We are focused on driving a strong value proposition to the consumer, which includes expanded category assortments, enhanced selling environments and targeted communications. Our fiscal '23 outlook still assumes caution in this channel through the rest of the year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site increased 9% and more than 40% on a 2-year stack, driven by strong performance in core product, tailored styles and footwear. Digital AUR increased on continued product mix elevation.\nIn North America Wholesale, revenues declined 2% to last year. As we discussed in November, the decline was entirely driven by our customs delay, which resulted in missed Q3 shipment windows, representing about 3 points of negative impact. As expected, we also saw a slowdown in replenishment trends as our partners focus on keeping inventories clean heading into the new year. Outside of this, our positioning in the wholesale channel remains competitively strong. We gained market share across men's, women's and kids in key partners, and our AUR and wholesale grew 10% on continued product elevation.\nPromotions on our brands at wholesale were largely aligned with our expectations going into the season. Inventories at wholesale are now normalized following last year's supply chain disruption, and we have experienced minimal cancellations to date for spring '23. We still expect wholesale to be up in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, despite our more cautious view on replenishment and our spring '23 inventory buys.\nMoving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. This 13% growth included about 450 basis points of benefit from the post-Christmas timing shift as well as a wholesale allowance benefit recognized in the quarter. We estimate the timing shift will negatively impact the smaller fourth quarter by about 120 basis points in Europe. Q3 European retail comps increased 11% on top of the 55% compare last year. Brick-and-mortar comps also up 11%, benefited from lapping the start of last year's Omicron variant as well as the post-Christmas sales shift into Q3. AUR increased 12% with gains in both brick-and-mortar and digital AUR. Total digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with low double-digit growth in owned digital commerce and wholesale.com more than offsetting softer pure-play results as anticipated. Europe wholesale declined 1% on a reported basis, but grew 11% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations, driven by roughly 8 points benefit related to lower-than-anticipated wholesale allowances as well as stronger spring '23 shipments and fill rates, more than offsetting softer reorder trends.\nNote that our wholesale outlook continues to embed a notable deceleration through Q4 based on challenging compares and macro headwinds. Overall, while our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first 3 quarters of the year, we remain cautious on the remainder of fiscal '23 into fiscal '24, given dynamic macro conditions across the region.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency, a strong result given significant COVID outbreaks in the Chinese Mainland as well as higher infection rates in Japan. Asia retail comps were up 8% with balanced growth across digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores.\nBy market, third quarter sales in Japan and Korea each increased mid-teens in constant currency. Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia were up more than 25% and 50%, respectively. The Chinese Mainland was up 7%, despite the significant COVID impacts Patrice mentioned, while Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan grew low teens in the quarter. We returned to full operations in the Mainland by mid-January. And while our teams are prepared to manage through further disruptions, we are encouraged by the continued resilience and strength of our consumer and brand momentum in China along with the rest of Asia.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times.\nThrough the third quarter, we returned approximately $560 million in the form of our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date. We ended the period with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory increased 33%, moderating from first half trends as we reduced goods in transit and significantly improved our lead times from last year's global supply chain delays. Inventory growth still reflects earlier timing of receipts, higher product costs and our strategy of product mix elevation. Nevertheless, we still expect to end fiscal '23 with inventory more closely aligned to sales growth. We continue to manage our inventory position fund with the majority still weighted for and seasonless product. This gives us greater flexibility to adjust future production levels and allocate product to the channels and geographies with the strongest demand. We also continue to make meaningful improvements in transit times as we move through this year.\nLooking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in the Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impact.\nFor fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits or about 8% on a 52-week comparable basis. Our outlook continues to assume a challenging consumer backdrop in Europe and North America. We now expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenues by approximately 600 basis points. We expect operating margin of approximately 13.5% to 14% in constant currency compared to our prior outlook of about 14%. This is based on a more modest level of gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we keep inventories current and align to demand. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 180 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis.\nGross margin is now expected to be flattish to last year on a constant currency basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix to offset increased product costs. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 150 basis points in fiscal '23. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week comparable basis, we expect constant currency revenue growth of about mid- to high single digits. On a reported basis, which includes the impact of last year's 53rd week, we expect revenues to be up 1% and 2% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points.\nOur outlook also includes about 170 basis points of negative impact from the week after Christmas shifting into fiscal Q3 from Q4 last year. We expect fourth quarter operating margin of about 5.5% in constant currency. This represents a roughly 190 basis point increase to last year, driven primarily by operating expense leverage as we normalize our cadence of marketing spend versus last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 160 basis points in the quarter. We expect constant currency gross margins to be about flat in Q4. This implies roughly 50 basis points of expansion on a 13-week comparable basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margin in the quarter by about 140 basis points. We now expect our tax rate in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and estimate a roughly 29% tax rate for the fourth quarter. Though this could vary widely as Q4 is our smallest quarter and highly dependent on mix and discrete items. And lastly, we now expect capital expenditures in the range of $240 million to $250 million based on the timing of build-out.\nIn closing, our teams around the world are operating with agility and executing strongly, driving continued progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. This is a testament to the power of our iconic brand that Ralph created over 50 years ago, and the strength of our Fortress Foundation coupled with diversified engines of growth across product categories, geographies and channels.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van der Ghinst\n\nVP of IR, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.\nDuring today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.\nTo find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice.\n\nPatrice Jean Louis Louvet\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day in September, where we laid out our ambition to be the world's leading luxury lifestyle company. We also outlined our company's next phase of growth powered by multiple engines, which we are calling our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We are off to a strong early start with our second quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating the consistency and momentum of our business around the world.\nAt the same time, we continue to drive a culture of operating excellence as ongoing productivity is an important driver to fuel our near- and long-term growth. This resulted in another quarter of double-digit AUR growth and sales exceeding our plan even as the broader marketplace became more promotional into the fall as anticipated.\nAlso, as we had expected from the start of this fiscal year, the global operating environment has remained choppy across many of our key markets. Our solid performance amidst this backdrop is a credit to our team's agility and execution as we focus on delivering what we can control. And while we expect this choppiness to continue in the near term, we are encouraged that our core consumer remains generally resilient despite the macro headlines, reflecting increasing desirability for our brand and the attractive value proposition of our products.\nAs we navigate the broader macro headwinds, we're focused on driving our 3 strategic pillars of long-term growth. These include: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. And spanning everything we do is our commitment to deliver positive impact in the world across citizenship and sustainability.\nLet me take you through a few of our second quarter highlights across our plan. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our Lifestyle brand. As we continue to build our business for the long term, we remain focused on investing in our brand to deliver a differentiated, elevated message to our target consumers. Consumers' perception of Ralph Lauren as a luxury brand remained high at 78%, and their perception of our brand's value for money continued to expand both sequentially and versus last year in the second quarter. This is enabling us to both strengthen our existing relationships and recruit new, younger, high-value consumers around the world with the growth in our highest value consumers significantly outpacing our total business.\nWe are leveraging our core brand values and ROI-driven marketing strategy in order to connect authentically with consumers and continue to gain market share. This was evident in the second quarter where we continue to focus our investments on driving brand desirability across a diverse range of activities.\nFirst, we celebrated the energy and optimism of sport to our annual sponsorship of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, which were particularly thrilling this year with record attendance levels and a 50% increase in viewership. It was hard to miss Polo on the court and in the audience from our official ball person uniforms made with recycled plastic to our timeless spectator style showcased by celebrities like and Anne Hathaway, Diplo, Angus Cloud and Jamie Foxx. We were also proud to outfit Serena Williams in Vogue September issue, where the tennis legend announced her retirement from the sport.\nOur 360-degree campaign for back-to-school drove strong conversion in our Polo Kids business this fall. Our class of RL video in August, followed by our women's Polo ID handbag video in September, were our top viewed Instagram reels on our Polo handle of all time.\nWe continue to capture key brand moments that resonate with fashion lovers around the world. 2022 was the year of weddings. And we were front and center dressing Hollywood royalty like Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, along with NBA superstar, Kevin Love's wedding to Kate Bock.\nA few weeks ago, we hosted our first-ever fashion show on the West Coast, at the Huntington Library in L.A., celebrities and friends of the brand like Lily Collins, John Legend, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, Diane Keaton and newlyweds JLo and Ben Affleck joined us in celebrating the optimism and joy of California Dreaming, featuring our full luxury lifestyle brand ranging from RRL to Polo Men's, Women's, Kids and Home.\nAnd as we continue driving our brand leadership deeper into the metaverse, we launched our first collaboration with Fortnite last week, in time for holiday. The popular online game has more than 400 million registered accounts with a strong following among 18- to 24-year olds. The partnership includes a special collection of digital outfits and 2 special drops of physical product available in our DTC channels and select specialty retailers around the world. Together, these activations are attracting younger, full price consumers to our business.\nWe exceeded 50 million social media followers globally this quarter, a high single-digit increase to last year led by Instagram. In our DTC businesses, we added 1.3 million new consumers similar to recent trends. And our online search trends grew low double digits to last year in Q2, significantly outpacing our peers across our top markets globally, led by Polo shirts and fall apparel such as sweaters and fleece.\nMoving to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. As we work toward becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company, our products all come back to the idea of inviting consumers to step into the world of Ralph Lauren. Ralph and our design teams are capturing the breadth of styles and end users consumers are looking for today, from a more sophisticated take on casual comfort to their modern hybrid approach to where to work and social gatherings.\nStarting with our core product, which grew mid-teens in the second quarter, supported by all key categories led by sweaters, seasonal core knits, sweatshirts and chinos. As we discussed at our Investor Day, our core product comprises about 70% of our assortment and is a key competitive advantage in the marketplace. In times of uncertainty, consumers continue to invest in brands and products they know and trust.\nOur core also establishes the credentials for driving our high potential categories, which include Women's, Outerwear and our emerging Home business. Together, these high potential categories grew high teens in the quarter. Women's represents our single-largest long-term opportunity for market share gains and category growth as a company. We are trading her into the brand, including the successful launch of our Polo ID handbag collection this year. We are trading here across by building an offering of essentials like sweaters, sophisticated coats, dresses and denim that will form the foundation of her wardrobe and expand her lifetime value. And we are trading her up to more elevated product through our hybrid styling as only Ralph can, with Women's AUR up 20% in the second quarter.\nWithin Outerwear, another high potential category which now represents about 10% of sales, we are establishing our brand as a go-to player for the category. Second quarter highlights included our quilted Beaton and Harper jackets, cotton twill city windbreaker and Terra Packable vest. Our kids outerwear business was led by the launch of our P-Layer outerwear system, a versatile collection of functional outer shells and liners constructed of all recycled materials.\nOther product highlights and special releases this quarter included our U.S. Open Collection, which drove our highest sales ever for the event. We also introduced our first U.S. Open Sneaker, which sold out in our stores, our NOLA Collection for Women inspired by the culture, climate and beauty of New Orleans, and our Polo Active Club collection tailored to next-generation consumers, the digital campaign was brought to life with skateboarder filmmaker, Mikey Alfred and his skate group. From our Polo bear sweaters to a return of tailored dressing, our teams are consistently delivering the styles consumers are craving in this new normal.\nSwitching to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We continue to drive our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in the second quarter with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Each of our ecosystems is led by a digital-first mindset, representing the best expression of our brand through innovative storytelling, dedicated shop-in-shops and virtual selling experiences.\nSecond quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, accelerated to mid-teens growth in constant currency. Our Asia digital ecosystem once again drove the fastest growth globally over a smaller base, up more than 60% in constant currency to last year. Within our own digital sites, sales grew mid-single digits in the second quarter and more than 40% on a 2-year stack.\nWe continue to drive an increased penetration of full price selling through elevated products and investments in AI-powered targeting and high-quality new consumer acquisition. Growth was also supported by the continued launch of new sites, including the recent additions of Korea and Australia.\nOur digital capabilities also provide true endless connectivity to our physical channels. Indeed, our stores remain a critical component of our ecosystems to build our brand and consumer engagement around the world. We opened 29 new stores and concessions in top cities globally this quarter with the vast majority in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland. Our brand momentum and opportunities in China remains strong with sales up more than 30%. Performance was balanced across Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Mainland despite mandatory closures in the period.\nAs you heard at Investor Day, China provides not only the successful blueprint for our elevated ecosystem strategy globally. It also represents one of several geographic long-term opportunities for our brand with strong brand momentum, our highest AUR in the world, and significant runway for strategic store openings to strengthen our relationship with the Chinese consumer.\nLooking ahead, the strength we are also seeing across markets like Korea and Australia are just 2 examples of the diversity of growth drivers that we have around the world. As you heard in September, we remain bullish on our long-term growth opportunities and ability to strategically drive lifetime value across all of our regions.\nAnd finally, touching briefly on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 business enablers, which we highlighted in September. These include: our people and culture, one of our key competitive advantages; best-in-class digital technology and analytics; superior operational capabilities; a powerful balance sheet; and leadership in citizenship and sustainability. I won't go through all of these in detail again, but in the second quarter, we were particularly proud to be named one of the world's best employers by Forbes. Our people are at the heart of everything we do. They inspire us to be better and to do better.\nJust a few weeks ago, our teams around the world came together for our first in-person Pink Pony Walk since COVID. We celebrated the Ralph Lauren Foundation's $25 million grant to fund 5 cancer centers in the U.S. this year. But it was also a moment for us to reflect on our purpose and what we've been through over the past few years as humans, as an organization and the important role we play in our communities.\nIn closing, we are highly aware of the macro challenges across each of our geographies. Ralph and I are exceptionally proud of the creativity, agility and execution our teams continue to demonstrate as we effectively navigate these dynamic times. And while we expect the environment to remain choppy in the near term, what gives us confidence to deliver on our commitments are: our powerful authentic brand, Ralph built a brand that stands not just for one product, but a lifestyle, a dream to aspire to; our multipronged strategy with diversified growth vectors across regions, consumer groups, categories and channels and our fortress foundation.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nCFO & COO, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate solid progress on our NGC: Accelerate plan, exemplifying our team's execution strength across our multiple strategic drivers and superior operational capabilities in the face of further macro challenges and disruptions around the world. Our top line growth continued with Q2 revenues up 5% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency, ahead of our outlook. This quarter's performance was once again supported by positive growth in constant currency across all 3 regions.\nOperating margin also slightly exceeded our expectations even with inflationary cost pressures and a more normalized cadence of investments versus last year. We believe our elevated brand, focused strategy and targeted investments, when combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers, put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation through uncertain times.\nLet me take you through our second quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 13% in constant currency, above our outlook, led by double-digit growth in both Asia and Europe. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales continued to outpace our total company rate, up mid-teens in constant currency on top of a strong compare of nearly 50% last year. This includes mid-single-digit growth within our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites on top of more than 30% growth last year.\nWe continue to invest in enhanced digital content and storytelling and to expand the breadth of our offering, including the addition of a home shop in the past year. We are also driving further improvements in the quality of sales, with a meaningful increase in full price sales penetration and digital margins still strongly accretive to our overall profitability in the quarter.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin was 64.6%, down 270 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 80 basis points in constant currency, in line with our outlook.\nSecond quarter AUR was up 18% on top of 15% growth last year. Continued AUR momentum was more than offset by channel mix pressure from stronger-than-expected wholesale performance and higher product costs, including freight. However, the higher freight spend enabled our improved fall on-time delivery rates and full price selling to deliver revenue outperformance in the quarter. Compared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, gross margin was 310 basis points higher in the second quarter.\nAdjusted operating margin was 13.4% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency, representing a 110 basis point decline in constant currency as we normalize spending versus unusually low levels last year during COVID. This was ahead of our outlook driven by strong operating expense discipline and productivity measures. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 51.2% of sales, including marketing expense growth of 18% over last year's lower spend.\nMarketing was 6.8% of sales, in line with our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. While we have built increased flexibility across our operating expense structure, we remain committed to investing in our brand, which is driving both near-term top line momentum as well as longer-term brand equity.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. The region's pivot to growth continues with second quarter revenues up 3%. In North America Retail, comps were flat on top of a strong 31% COVID reopening compare last year. While we were encouraged by positive comp growth in our full price stores, this was offset by softer performance in our outlets as anticipated in our guidance. Our outlet AUR, up mid-teens, reflects our ongoing brand elevation efforts in the channel. However, we continue to see softness in our value-oriented consumers, a subsegment of the channel.\nIn the current environment, we are focused on communicating our strong value proposition to the consumer, which, as Patrice mentioned, continued to strengthen in Q2. This is supported by our targeted personalized communications. We are managing this channel carefully given ongoing macro headwinds and have assumed increased caution in our fiscal '23 outlook.\nNorth America store traffic trends remain below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the broader industry, although our foreign tourist sales continued to show improvements to last year. Comps in our owned RalphLauren.com site were down slightly, but increased more than 30% on the 2-year stack. While we were encouraged by our increased penetration of full price sales online, this was offset by higher seasonal clearance to keep inventory clean ahead of holiday.\nIn North America Wholesale, revenues increased 8% to last year, accelerating sequentially from first quarter trends driven by full price channels. Our strong continued performance reflects our improved brand positioning in the channel with further market share gains in Men's, Women's and Kids versus pre-pandemic levels in key partners.\nOur sell-out grew high single digits to last year on better-than-expected fall fill rates and enhanced marketing. Our AUR at wholesale also grew high single digits to last year as we elevated product, pulled back promotions and increased targeted communications.\nInventories remain well positioned in the channel versus demand, and we have not experienced cancellations to date for either holiday or spring '23. We still expect the channel to be up modestly in the second half of fiscal '23, despite challenging compares from last year and our more cautious approach to spring '23 inventory buys. Off-price sales declined double digits to last year and more than 60% to pre-pandemic levels as we realign this channel to be an excess clearance vehicle.\nMoving on to Europe. Second quarter revenue was flat on a reported basis and increased 15% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 3% on top of a 27% compare last year. Brick-and-mortar store comps were flat over last year's strong 28% compare, which benefited from the reopening of all markets post COVID.\nTotal digital ecosystem grew mid-teens in the quarter, including a mid-teen comp in own digital commerce. While the first half trends were robust, supported by improved receipt performance, we remain cautious in the second half of fiscal '23 into fiscal '24 given dynamic macro conditions across the region. Europe wholesale grew 9% on a reported basis and 24% in constant currency, driven by stronger fall receipts and fill rates. Our outlook continues to embed a notable deceleration in the second half based on strong compares and macro headwinds broadly across the region.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 17% on a reported basis and 33% in constant currency. Asia retail comps were up 25% with strong growth in digital commerce along with brick-and-mortar stores over the last year's easier compares due to store closures.\nBy market, every country delivered double-digit growth or higher in the second quarter. This was led by strong continued momentum in Korea, up 26% in constant currency, and sales in Japan, which increased 16% as we lapped COVID restrictions in the prior year period.\nFollowing last quarter's heavy COVID restrictions in Shanghai, China returned to robust growth, increasing more than 30% in Q2 despite COVID-related closures in about 35% of our Mainland stores. Nearly all of China's stores were reopened by the end of the quarter.\nSoutheast Asia and Australia both grew triple digits in the period in constant currency, lapping pandemic lockdowns in the prior year. Across our regions, our Q2 performance continued to exemplify the diversity of our growth drivers, not just by geography, but across product categories and channels.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be a cornerstone of our fortress foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times.\nDuring the second quarter, we returned approximately $220 million to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We ended the period with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt.\nNet inventory increased 36% to last year, moderating from first quarter trends, but strategically higher to support continued demand for our brand and products; earlier receipts and higher goods in transit to mitigate global supply chain delays; increased product costs, including freight and cotton, which we will start to overlap in the second half of fiscal '23; and continued elevation of our product mix. We are managing inventories carefully in this dynamic environment. While we still expect inventory growth to remain at similar levels through the holiday, this should become more closely aligned to sales by the end of the fiscal year.\nWe believe our inventories are well positioned with 70% of our business comprised of core and replenishment product, as Patrice mentioned. This drives greater consistency in our growth as well as better supply chain planning and visibility and shorter lead times.\nLooking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and this guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. For fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency with revenues expected to increase high single digits or about 8% on a 52-week comparable basis.\nWhile the first half revenues outperformed our expectations, this incorporates our more cautious view on second half revenues given the challenging consumer backdrop in Europe and North America. We now expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenues by approximately 730 basis points, driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar. As a reminder, we still expect fiscal '23 growth to also be negatively impacted by about 100 basis points due to the absence of last year's 53rd week.\nWe now expect operating margins at the low end of our previous range of 14% to 14.5% in constant currency. This reflects a more challenging global macro environment, including our more cautious outlook on second half revenues, geographic mix with a higher sales contribution from Asia this year and channel mix including the impact of a U.S. customs delay on select wholesale shipments in Q3 expected to be resolved in the next few months.\nForeign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 200 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis.\nGross margin is still expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix more than offsetting increased freight and material costs. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 170 basis points in fiscal '23.\nWhile we still expect input costs to remain structurally higher in the near term, we expect gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we start to lap higher cost increases. For the third quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 780 basis points. We expect third quarter operating margin in a range of 17.3% to 17.8% in constant currency. At the midpoint, this represents a roughly 160 basis point increase to last year, driven by gross margin expansion as we start to lap higher airfreight costs from last year.\nForeign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 180 basis points and gross margin by about 170 basis points in the quarter. We still expect our tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% for the full year and also for the third quarter. And we moderated our CapEx outlook to about $250 million to $275 million based on the timing of projects.\nIn closing, we are proud of our team's execution agility and progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan this quarter, even as we navigate a highly dynamic global operating environment. Ralph created an iconic brand that inspires people around the world to dream. These qualities hold as true today as they did 50 years ago. With our brand as our touchstone, we will continue to focus on what we can control and leverage our multiple engines of growth across geographies, product categories and channels.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van der Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van der Ghinst\n\nVP of IR, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions, which we ask that you limit to one per caller.\nDuring today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.\nTo find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Patrice.\n\nPatrice Jean Louis Louvet\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Corey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong first quarter performance underscores the resilience and momentum of our business around the world. This follows our significant multiyear reset to transform our consumer base, product portfolio and distribution. These results also validate the strong confidence that Ralph and I have in our teams, who are consistently executing with incredible dedication and agility through what continues to be uncertain times.\nWe exceeded our expectations again on both the top and bottom line with broad-based strength across all 3 regions despite macro headwinds from COVID and inflationary pressures in the quarter. Our teams are driving increasing desirability for our brands and products, enabling high-quality consumer recruitment as well as retention.\nOur proven ability to drive a strong value proposition for our consumer, which has strengthened over the last 4 years of our strategic plan, is an important advantage for Ralph Lauren, especially through times of macro uncertainty. We are obviously highly attentive to the volatility highlighted recently by our retail peers across the price spectrum. And while we are not immune to broader macro headwinds, we remain focused on what we can control. We have many areas of strength that include a powerful, differentiated brand that we continue to invest in, a strong core business that is resilient through challenging cycles, a more flexible expense structure, a diversified global supply chain with proven agility and discipline in our inventory management, and a robust balance sheet, which enables us to make the right decisions for the long-term health of our business.\nAnd while we continue to adapt to shifting macro developments, this strong foundation gives us confidence as we drive our business across multiple engines of long-term growth. These include: first, continuing to drive brand heat and desirability; second, leveraging our luxury halo and unique multi-category lifestyle proposition, where we can dial certain product categories up or down as consumer needs evolve; and third, rolling out our key city ecosystem strategy led by digital.\nWe are balancing these priorities with our ongoing focus on productivity, an important driver to fuel our top and bottom line growth. And spanning everything we do is our commitment to deliver positive impact in the world across citizenship and sustainability.\nOur first quarter performance was a strong example of our progress across each of these areas. Let me take you through a few of our first quarter highlights across the strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation. In the current operating environment, we remain focused on investing in our brand to deliver a clear, differentiated message to our target consumers. Our multifaceted marketing strategy is focused on leveraging our core brand values to connect authentically with consumers, strengthening existing relationships and recruiting new and younger high-value consumers around the world.\nThis was particularly evident in the first quarter, where we continued to focus our investments on driving brand desirability across a diverse range of activities. First, we kicked off the 50th anniversary celebration of our iconic Polo shirt this spring with a 360-degree campaign and book launch across our stores, social media and celebrity moments, which we amplified globally. While our business is so much more than a Polo shirt, this icon is a testament to the unique emotional connection consumers have with our brand across ages, genders and geographies.\nYou may have seen our dynamic billboards in the heart of Seoul, Paris, London and L.A. We also launched a limited edition vintage Polo collection in stores and our latest sustainable Earth Polo.\nWe invited our fans throughout the world to share touching personal stories about their memories with the Polo shirt on social media. As consumers increasingly value brands that are timeless and authentic, we continue to weave Ralph Lauren into the fabric of modern culture around the world.\nSimilarly, we celebrated the optimism and perseverance of sport through our 17th annual sponsorship of the Wimbledon Championships. Inspired by our timeless spectator style, this year's new uniforms combined the heritage of our brand with modern silhouettes and fabrications, including the use of recycled materials. And we continue to capture key brand moments that resonate with fashion lovers around the world, including our Gilded Glamour dressing at this year's Met Gala.\nFriends of the brand like Alicia Keys in her showstopping homage to the New York City skyline with husband Swizz Beatz, Ryan Reynolds and J Balvin channeling old Hollywood, and the always daring Janelle Monae were all featured in our brand. These activations attracted younger full-price consumers to our business, driving another quarter of strong top line growth.\nNew consumers on our digital sites grew nearly 70% to pre-pandemic levels. And our online search trends grew high teens to last year in Q1, led by our Polo shirt and spring luxury campaigns, significantly outperforming our peers globally.\nTouching on our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph and our design teams continue to deliver the products consumers are craving in this moment, with broad-based strength across our range of luxury lifestyle categories.\nPeople are coming together again with a renewed appetite for style. From a fresh approach to wear-to-work, to weddings and other social gatherings, our brand is uniquely positioned to capture this mix of sophisticated and casual dressing.\nProduct highlights this quarter included our global Polo shirt campaign, which drove strong performance across a range of styles from our core mesh to our seasonal prints and novelty offerings. This strong trend was reinforced by the introduction of our upcycled Polo shirts, celebrating the timeless quality and consumers' emotional connection to this iconic style; our Cobble Hill collection for Polo men's, which celebrates our sophisticated sportswear in the modern wardrobe. And our Athletic Club collection, bringing classic tennis and golf inspired styling to the next generation was a standout for the season. With strong sales in lightweight sporting windbreakers, rugby shirts and fleece in classic combinations of white and dark green. From our clean summer whites to our colorful classics, Ralph Lauren embodied the exuberance of a return to head-to-toe dressing at its best.\nShifting gears to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in the first quarter, with a focus on elevating our touch points with the consumer across every channel.\nDuring the quarter, we opened more than 60 new stores and concessions in top cities globally. Nearly all of our store openings were in Asia and notably the Chinese mainland, where our brand momentum and opportunities remain strong despite transitory COVID lockdowns. Following our first 2 emblematic store openings last year in Beijing and Shanghai, we opened a third emblematic concept in Chengdu, another key city cluster, which also included our first restaurant and bar in China, reinforcing our lifestyle offering in the market. And while roughly 50% of our China stores were negatively impacted by COVID closures in the quarter, driving mainland sales down 10% to last year in constant currency, we continue to reinforce our elevated brand positioning in the market.\nOur 520 and 618 festival performance outpaced our closest peers by double digits, while we also increased our penetration of full-price sales. We remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory in China, with strong brand momentum and an encouraging recovery in performance as COVID-related store restrictions were lifted in late June as expected. We continue to watch our key markets carefully, including the ongoing impact of COVID variants.\nMoving to our priority of leading with digital. We have made significant progress over the last 4 years in repositioning our digital business, putting it on the path of strong margin-accretive growth that is outpacing total company growth. This progress is underscored by our recent ranking in the Luxury Digital IQ Index for 2022, where we were proud to rank #2 among 75 global luxury retailers, up from #5 last year.\nFirst quarter sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew mid-single digits in constant currency. This was on top of an exceptionally strong compare of more than 80% last year and about 85% growth in first quarter of fiscal '21.\nWithin our own Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew high single digits in the first quarter. We continue to drive strong full price selling as we deliver the right mix of products and invest in AI-powered targeting and high-quality new consumer acquisition.\nWe also launched new localized digital commerce sites to support our ecosystem expansion globally. This includes the 21 sites launched in Europe in fiscal '22 and new sites added in the first quarter in India and Israel.\nOur Asia digital ecosystem once again drove the fastest growth globally, over a smaller base, up more than 60% in constant currency to last year. This was led by triple-digit growth in Korea and 40% growth in China, where our digital businesses outperformed peers and the broader market despite disrupted supply chains in Shanghai and shipment restrictions on nonessential goods.\nWe were also encouraged by early performance in our Australia digital flagship, which we launched at the end of Q4.\nMoving to our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our teams have operated with incredible agility to mitigate emerging macro challenges, delivering operating margins ahead of our expectations in the first quarter despite increased cost headwinds.\nIn June, we published our Timeless By Design global citizenship and sustainability report, outlining our commitments to address our impact. While I encourage you all to download the report from our website, let me highlight a couple of exciting initiatives. First, we officially announced our first cradle-to-cradle certified product with our iconic luxury cashmere sweater launching later this fiscal year, with more C2C products to come.\nAnd we're kicking off our Live On promise to enable our past and future products to live on responsibly by 2030. In addition, we were proud to recently be named one of [Parity.Org's] Best Companies for Women to Advance for the third year in a row as we further our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nIn closing, our company has weathered a variety of macro environments over the last 55 years, not to mention the last 3, with our organization emerging stronger and more agile than ever before. Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the passion and execution our teams have demonstrated throughout, all while staying true to the values that have made this brand revered and emotionally connected since its inception. And I am confident that the healthy foundations we've put into place along with our multiple engines of growth will enable us to continue driving toward our commitments of long-term value creation.\nAs always, we remain keenly focused on what we can control, and are executing on our long-term strategic initiatives while continuing to navigate an uncertain global environment. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month.\nAnd before I turn it over to Jane, I'd like to welcome Deb Cupp, who joined our Board of Directors last week. Currently the President of Microsoft North America, she will bring important perspective to our digital acceleration and more. Ralph and I would also like to thank parting Director Judith McHale, who has served on our Board since 2001, for her many years of leadership and dedication to the company.\nWith that, I'll hand it to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nCFO & COO, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the broad-based strength of our strategic plan, the durability of our business model and the execution excellence of our teams in the face of challenges and disruptions around the world.\nOur pivot to offense showed in our top line growth, with Q1 revenues up 8% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency, above pre-pandemic levels and more than 500 basis points above our outlook. This was supported by positive growth across all 3 regions, despite lapping our final quarter of major distribution resets and COVID-related shutdowns in China.\nOperating profit dollars also grew versus pre-pandemic levels, with continued operating expense discipline helping to mitigate transitory cost pressures. And we achieved all of this while continuing to drive important investments in marketing, digital, new stores and people.\nWe believe our elevated brand, focused strategy and targeted investments, when combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress balance sheet, gives us a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation through uncertain times.\nLet me take you through our first quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues, up 13% in constant currency, significantly outperformed our outlook. Results included roughly 4 points of negative impact from our divestiture of Club Monaco and licensing of our North American Chaps brand last year, implying even stronger underlying growth.\nRalph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew mid-single digits in constant currency on top of more than 80% growth last year. Our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew high single digits on top of last year's 49% compare, reflecting our compelling product assortments, new consumer acquisition and user-friendly connected retail capabilities. Digital margins remained strongly accretive to our profitability in the quarter.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin was 68%, down 180 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 80 basis points in constant currency.\nFirst quarter AUR was up 8% on top of 18% growth last year. Solid AUR momentum was more than offset by higher-than-anticipated freight spend, which helped support our strong spring on-time delivery rates and full price selling to deliver revenue outperformance in the quarter.\nCompared to fiscal '20 pre-pandemic levels, gross margin was 350 basis points higher in the first quarter. We continue to expect freight raw materials and labor costs to pressure gross margins this year, particularly through Q2, until we start to lap higher cost increases in the second half of the year.\nWe plan to leverage our multipronged elevation strategy to continue driving AUR in order to mitigate mid- to high single-digit product cost inflation this year.\nAdjusted operating margin was 12.7%, down 410 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points in constant currency as we normalize spending versus unusually low levels last year due to COVID. This was ahead of our outlook, driven by strong operating expense discipline and productivity initiatives.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 13% to 55.2% of sales, including marketing expense growth of about 40% over last year's lower spend. Marketing was 7% of sales, at the high end of our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. While we have built increased flexibility across our operating expense structure, we remain committed to investing in our brand, which is driving both near-term top line momentum and share gains as well as longer-term brand equity.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. The region's improved trajectory continues, with first quarter revenues up 6%. These results included about 3 points of headwind from our licensing of Chaps, implying even stronger underlying growth. Q1 represents the final quarter of meaningful headwinds from our North America strategic resets.\nIn North America retail, comps increased 5% to last year, led by double-digit growth in our full-price stores. Performance was driven by improved traffic, larger basket sizes and 12% AUR growth on top of 39% last year, reflecting our ongoing elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Foreign tourist sales continued to show sequential improvement, but were still below pre-pandemic levels.\nOur premium position helped our outlet channel deliver positive comp growth in the quarter. However, growth was more modest than in our full-price business. We attribute this partially to higher cost pressures and weaker consumer sentiment among value-oriented shoppers across the marketplace.\nWe are rolling out a number of interventions. These include leveraging our AI-driven targeted communications, accelerating new ways of selling to support conversion, expediting shipments of core products that are selling well, and more. We will continue to watch this channel carefully given ongoing macro headwinds, and have embedded increased caution in our current fiscal '23 outlook.\nComps in our owned RalphLauren.com site grew 2% on top of a strong 51% compare last year, supported by solid demand for our products and ability to retain newly acquired consumers. In North America wholesale, revenues increased 5% to last year, significantly above our expectations. Results included about 8 points of negative impact from licensing Chaps. This outperformance was driven by our full-price wholesale business, reflecting our improved brand positioning in the channel.\nSellout grew mid-teens to last year on better-than-expected spring fill rates and enhanced marketing. Our AUR at wholesale also grew double digits to last year as we further elevated product, pulled back promotions and increased targeted communications.\nWe are winning with the consumer with continued market share gains in men's, women's and kids in our key partners. Inventory growth was also broadly aligned with sellout.\nWhile we are watching macro developments carefully, we continue to be strongly encouraged by our healthy foundation and broad-based momentum across North America, setting the path for long-term growth.\nMoving on to Europe. First quarter revenues increased 17% on a reported basis and 28% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 34%. Brick-and-mortar store comps grew 45% to last year when approximately 15% of our stores were closed, along with further heavy restrictions from the Delta variant. Digital commerce comps grew 7% on top of a 98% compare last year, when widespread COVID closures shifted a disproportionate share of business online.\nEurope wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency, driven by stronger fall bookings and fill rates, reorder trends and sustained growth with our digital pure plays.\nTurning to Asia. Revenues increased 16% on a reported basis and 26% in constant currency. Asia retail comps grew 19% on top of a 43% compare last year, with digital commerce increasing 37% and brick-and-mortar stores up 17%. We maintained strong momentum across our total digital ecosystem in the region with more than 60% growth this quarter. This was supported by double-digit increases across our owned sites and wholesale digital businesses.\nBy market, first quarter sales in Japan improved sequentially to 32% in constant currency following last quarter's Omicron restrictions. This represents a double-digit increase to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '20. Strong momentum also continued in Korea, where sales grew 30% in the quarter. And both Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia grew double and triple digits in the period, respectively.\nOur broad-based performance helped to offset strict COVID lockdowns in the Chinese Mainland this quarter, where total sales declined 10% in constant currency due to store closures. Based on our strong return to positive sales growth from late June onward, we remain optimistic about the resilience of the Chinese consumer and our continued brand momentum in the market. And while we continue to manage through COVID disruptions, including recent lockdowns in Macau and Hong Kong, our teams are driving offense across our other key markets to deliver strong double-digit growth.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders even through dynamic times. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We also paid down $500 million in debt that matured in June to end the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. This compared to $3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year.\nNet inventory increased 47%. Similar to the previous quarter, this growth is to support strong demand for our brand and products; a deliberate increase in goods in transit as we take inventory earlier to help mitigate supply chain delays, particularly in wholesale; increased product costs, including freight and cotton, which we will start to lap in the second half of fiscal '23; and continued elevation of our product mix. Based on these trends, we expect inventory to remain at similar levels through holiday, becoming more closely aligned to sales by the end of the fiscal year.\nWe are managing inventory very carefully in this dynamic environment in order to satisfy robust consumer demand, while maintaining our long-term quality of sales trajectory. This includes leveraging our strong core and replenishment business, which has greater supply chain visibility and shorter lead times, to effectively flex up or down as needed with demand, as we did most recently through the pandemic.\nLooking ahead, our outlook is based on the evolving macro environment, including inflationary pressures, disruptions in the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in the Ukraine. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios, and this guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts.\nFor fiscal '23, we are maintaining our full year outlook in constant currency, with revenues expected to increase high single digits, centering on 8%, on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on unfavorable spot rates, however, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, we still expect fiscal '23 growth to also be negatively impacted by about 100 basis points due to the absence of last year's 53rd week.\nIn addition to the factors we outlined last quarter, including FX, softer consumer sentiment in Europe and Q1 China COVID lockdowns, our updated full year outlook also incorporates increased caution around our value-oriented consumers in North America, notably the potential for softer traffic and conversion rates through the end of the year. That said, we are reiterating our full year revenue outlook based on our strong Q1 outperformance and diversified engines of growth.\nWe still expect operating margin in the range of 14% to 14.5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 180 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis.\nGross margin is still expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency 52-week basis. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product mix, more than offsetting increased freight and material costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 150 basis points in fiscal '23.\nWe still expect gross margin contraction in the first half of the year due to increased freight pressures to meet demand. This is followed by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we start to lap the significant input cost increases.\nFor the second quarter, we expect constant currency revenue growth in a range centering on 11%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 750 basis points.\nWe expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 15.4% to 15.7% in constant currency, reflecting increased headwinds from higher freight and marketing expense, which are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margins by about 240 basis points in the quarter.\nSecond quarter gross margin is expected to contract about 40 to 80 basis points in constant currency, with further AUR growth more than offset by increased freight and product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 190 basis points in the quarter.\nWe still expect our tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% for the full year and also for the second quarter. We continue to expect CapEx of about $290 million to $310 million.\nIn closing, we delivered another strong quarter inspired by Ralph's creative vision, coupled with the agility, dedication and relentless execution of our teams, all while continuing to navigate a volatile global operating environment.\nWhile staying grounded in the macro developments, we remain confident in our multiple engines of growth. We are laser-focused on what we can control: strengthening our consumer base; enhancing the desirability of our timeless brand; and maintaining operating discipline across our business.\nAnd with that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Ralph Lauren Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn over the conference to our host, Ms. Corinna Van Ghinst. Please go ahead.\n\nCorinna Van der Ghinst\n\nVP of IR, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Ralph Lauren's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. With me today are Patrice Louvet, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Nielsen, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. (Operator Instructions)\nDuring today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Our expectations contain many risks and uncertainties. Principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our SEC filings.\nTo find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to this morning's earnings release and to our SEC filings that can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Patrice.\n\nPatrice Jean Louis Louvet\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. This year's performance underscores the strength of our business and desirability of our brand around the world with both strong loyalty among our existing consumer base and enabling new high-value consumer recruitment. Ralph and I are inspired every day by our team's engagement, agility and execution, which is driving this progress.\nAs we enter fiscal '23, our consumer remains healthy and motivated to invest in the timeless quality products we have always stood for. While we consistently adapt to ever-changing macro developments, our strong brand momentum will continue to be supported by multiple engines of growth. These include: first, continuing to drive brand heat and desirability with increased marketing investment and a combination of iconic lifestyle campaigns and precision marketing. Second, leveraging our unique multi-category lifestyle proposition to drive the mix of sophisticated and casual dressing consumers crave. As we look ahead, there remain significant opportunities for category expansion and continued product elevation.\nAnd third, rolling out our key city ecosystem strategy, which integrates a brand-elevating cohesive consumer experience across our touch points. Originally developed in Asia, we're still in the early innings of scaling this model across each of our regions, including North America. Within this ecosystem, we lead with digital commerce, which continues to represent a significant growth opportunity while already solidly accretive to every region's profitability. Woven into all of these engines of growth is our focus on delivering positive impact in the world across citizenship and sustainability. Our fourth quarter performance was a great example of the continued progress we're making across these priorities as we pivot to growth while maintaining our culture of productivity. Despite macro headwinds from COVID, the devastating war in Ukraine and significant inflationary pressures, we expanded operating margin and each of our regions reported strong double-digit top line growth fueled by digital.\nLet me take you through a few of our fourth quarter and fiscal '22 highlights across the strategic pillars of our Next Great Chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation from our iconic brand moments at the Summer and Winter Olympics to our launches in gaming and the metaverse, consumers around the world are connecting more than ever to our brand positioning and product portfolio. We're also strengthening our relationships with higher income consumers across both our new and existing consumer base. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter where we shifted a significant portion of this year's investments to drive brand desirability across a diverse range of activities.\nFirst, this March marked our celebratory return to the runway at New York's Museum of Modern Art, where our men's and women's fashion show immersed viewers in the world of Ralph Lauren as only Ralph can. On stage and in the audience where faces familiar to the brand, including Janelle Monae; Gigi and Bella Hadid; Emily in Paris' Lily Collins; New York City Mayor, Eric Adams; and our newest fragrance ambassador, Angus Cloud from the hit show Euphoria. As we continue to amplify our events globally, we delivered our most successful TikTok campaign ever around the show with our largest growth in new followers on the platform this year.\nYou may have seen our exciting partnership with Morehouse and Spelman colleges this quarter, honoring the legacy of HBCUs and their contribution to the culture of American fashion. Inspired by the rich heritage and esteemed traditions of these 2 schools, this creative collaboration is just one example of our commitment to evolve how we portray the American dream, in the stories we tell and the faces and creators we champion. The collection, conversation and press surrounding this collection spark strong consumer engagement and traffic to our North American digital flagship in the quarter.\nAnd we continue to strengthen our leadership in the world of sports through our high visibility sponsorships of the Australian Open and Team USA at the Winter Olympics. This year's events were particularly thrilling as we celebrated the spirit of optimism and aspiration that these sports represent, consistent with our brand values. These activations not only drove another quarter of strong top line growth, but also help recruit younger, full-price consumers to the brand, particularly in our digital channels.\nNew consumers on our digital sites grew more than 70% to LLY, including an increased penetration of under 35 higher-value consumers. Our online search trends also grew double digits to last year in Q4, significantly outperforming peers globally. Looking to fiscal '23, we will continue to drive this momentum and desirability with iconic brand moments in sports and culture across our portfolio, all of which you will see amplified across our global campaigns.\nTouching on our second key initiative. Energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph Lauren is one of the few brands in the marketplace with the authenticity, quality and credibility to deliver products across a range of lifestyle categories. As Ralph likes to say, the brand is not about chasing fast trends, but rather about living. And I can't think of a moment where this has been more relevant as consumers come together again with a return to prepandemic activities. Our design team is leveraging the breadth of our portfolio to create products that our consumers can live in and feel confident in, regardless of what the new normal looks like for them.\nIn the fourth quarter, consumers gravitated back to more sophisticated luxury and formal wear looks, while we also continue to drive a mix of elevated but comfortable casual styles. As we continue to drive brand heat and new consumer acquisition, special collections this quarter included the Polo Color shop, our pre-Spring ode to the easy luxurious style of the Côte d'Azur; our Morehouse and Spelman Colleges collection, which sold out almost immediately; our Team USA Olympic styles, featuring intelligent insulation technology and inspiring our next generation of outerwear; and our Lunar New Year gifting, celebrating the Year of the Tiger. We are also proud to open our first iconic world of Ralph Lauren Home shop at Harrods this quarter, with more to come as we build on this high potential category. And in April, we launched our first unisex fragrance, POLO EARTH, a consciously designed vegan fragrance featuring sustainably sourced ingredients and recycled packaging.\nShifting gears to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our key city ecosystems around the world in fiscal '22, with a focus on elevating our touch points with the consumer across every channel. During the year, we opened 122 new stores and concessions in top cities globally. This fiscal year marked our first emblematic concept stores in China, in Beijing and Shanghai, our first European flagship opening since 2010, in Milan, and our first slate of full-priced North America store openings since 2016. The vast majority of our store openings continue to be in Asia and particularly the Chinese mainland, where our brand momentum remains strong despite recurring COVID lockdowns. Our fourth quarter Mainland sales were still up more than 25% to last year in constant currency. And our Lunar New Year performance across the market significantly outpaced the competition as we continue to build our brand for our local audience.\nWe further expanded our successful key city ecosystem model to other markets around the world this quarter. In North America, we just opened 1 new full-price store in Century City, Los Angeles and relocated 1 store in Bal Harbour, Miami for a total of 8 new full-price openings this fiscal year. Overall, coming out of fiscal '22, we are strongly encouraged that North America's turnaround is well underway as we fire on all cylinders following our final phase of major distribution resets over the past year.\nMoving to our priority of leading with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, Departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew low double digits in the fourth quarter and more than 80% to LLY in constant currency. For the full year, digital grew more than 40% to last year and 65% to LLY, reaching 26% of total revenue. This is consistent with our penetration levels during the height of COVID when stores were closed.\nWithin our own Ralph Lauren digital sites, sales grew 18% in the fourth quarter and more than 70% to LLY. We continue to drive strong full price selling as we deliver the right mix of product and invest in AI-powered targeting and new full-price consumer acquisition. We also launched new localized digital commerce sites to support our ecosystem expansion globally. This includes our first digital flagships in Australia and the Middle East as well as 15 new ship-to-destinations largely across broader Europe. During the year, we expanded on the connected retail capabilities we launched during the pandemic from virtual selling appointments to endless aisle product availability.\nLooking ahead, we will focus on scaling these capabilities, along with our full catalog mobile app launched this past holiday to provide our consumers with a seamless elevated brand experience across every touch point and our entire portfolio.\nMoving to our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our teams have operated with incredible agility to mitigate emerging macro challenges, delivering both gross and operating margin expansion again in the fourth quarter despite increased cost headwinds. In addition to implementing a culture of operating discipline across our company, over the last 24 months, we have driven further efficiencies in how we operate, from the launch of digital product design and virtual showrooms to digitizing our supply chain, in order to enable real-time visibility and planning. We also continue to make significant strides across our global citizenship and sustainability commitments over the past quarter and fiscal year.\nLet me highlight a few high-impact initiatives. Meaningfully progressing towards our target of at least 20% underrepresented race and ethnic groups on our global leadership team by 2023; delivering a $2 million donation in scholarships for students at historically black colleges and universities through the Ralph Lauren Foundation; launching the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund to support long-term sustainable cotton production in the U.S.; unveiling Color on Demand, the world's first scalable 0 wastewater cotton dyeing system; and bringing to market CLARUS, a first-to-market patented technology and critical step in scaling our use of recycled cotton. And recall, that in fiscal '22, we incorporated key ESG metrics into our executive compensation plans for the first time.\nIn closing, this year has been an exciting chapter on our journey to elevate our brands and pivot to offense. Ralph and I are proud of and encouraged by the passion, collaboration and execution of our teams. Together, we have fundamentally repositioned our business and are already starting to yield positive results across our multiple engines of growth.\nLooking ahead, we have strong confidence in this growth model and we'll continue to invest behind this year's momentum to deliver long-term value creation. We remain keenly focused on what we can control while continuing to navigate an uncertain global environment. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on September 19.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nCFO & COO, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We closed our fiscal '22 with strong fourth quarter and full year results that demonstrated meaningful progress toward our next great chapter goals, along with execution excellence by our teams and broad-based performance across our business.\nAll 3 regions are back to top line growth. Our revenues are now slightly ahead of prepandemic levels and our operating profit dollars are also 30% higher, all while ramping up investments in marketing, digital, new stores and people. Compared to 2 years ago, our businesses are over 25% bigger in Asia, nearly 10% bigger in Europe and North America is reset and delivering growth on a much healthier foundation. At the same time, our balance sheet enabled us to return significant excess cash to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation principles, and we resumed our quarterly dividend and share repurchases this year.\nWith the resets behind us, we are driving multiple growth engines across our brands, channels and geographies that will not only deliver more sustainable growth but also help to mitigate ongoing macro challenges.\nLet me take you through our fourth quarter financial highlights. Total company revenues increased 18% to last year on a reported basis and 22% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in every region. This includes roughly 5 points of negative impact from our deliberate North America resets last year. Revenues exceeded both our fiscal '19 and '20 prepandemic results despite the resets. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew low double digits in constant currency on top of a challenging compare of more than 60% growth last year.\nOur own Ralph Lauren digital sites grew 18%, reflecting our strong product assortments, new consumer acquisition, expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. Digital margins remain strongly accretive to our profitability again this quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin was 63.3%, up 40 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 120 basis points in constant currency as we continue to successfully mitigate a dynamic inflationary environment. Fourth quarter AUR was up 13% on top of 31% growth last year, with growth across every region. This strong AUR growth along with favorable channel and geographic mix more than offset higher-than-expected ocean freight costs with steep increases in oil prices following the invasion of Ukraine. We expect higher freight, raw material and labor cost to remain elevated into fiscal '23, particularly in the first half until we start to lap higher cost increases in the second half of the year.\nWe plan to leverage our multipronged elevation strategy to continue driving AUR significantly above our long-term targets in order to mitigate mid- to high single-digit product cost inflation in fiscal '23. Adjusted operating margin of 3.6% expanded 20 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 140 basis points in constant currency, driven by continued operating discipline.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 19% to 59.8% of sales, up 30 basis points on a reported basis, but down 20 basis points in constant currency. Marketing grew 48% to 9.5% of sales in the fourth quarter. We shifted a significant portion of our marketing investment from the first half to the second half of the year, as planned, to accelerate our brand momentum and direct-to-consumer expansion coming out of the pandemic.\nFull year marketing was 7.3% of sales, in line with our guidance. For fiscal '23, we still expect marketing of about 6% to 7% of sales as we continue to support our new digital sites, mobile apps content creation, new consumer acquisition and key brand moments, all to drive desirability and purchase intent.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. The region's turnaround continues with fourth quarter revenues up 19%. These results included a 13-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and license of Chaps, implying strong underlying growth. In North America Retail, comps increased 21% to last year. Growth was driven by improved traffic, transactions and 19% AUR growth on top of 30% last year, reflecting our continued elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions.\nBrick-and-mortar comps grew 19%, driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes, traffic and conversion. Performance was strong in both our full price and factory stores on growing domestic demand, even as foreign tourism remains muted. We drove further momentum in our own digital commerce business this quarter with comps up 27% on top of 25% growth last year. Our continued focus on high-value new consumer acquisition helped deliver growth in AUR and basket sizes while further reducing our discount rate.\nIn North America wholesale, revenues increased 1% to last year, slightly above our expectations. These results included 25 points of negative impact from our deliberate reset and Chaps. Underlying growth and quality of sales continued to exceed our expectations. This was led by our full-price businesses, with sell-out growth of more than 20% to last year and 45% to LLY. We drove continued market share gains in men's and kids in our key partners along with 3 consecutive quarters of gains in women's ready-to-wear. Our wholesale AUR was also up more than 25% to last year as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions. As we close out fiscal '22, we are very encouraged by our strong foundation and broad-based momentum across North America, setting the path for long-term future growth.\nMoving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 26% on a reported basis and 34% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 77%, led by triple-digit comps in brick-and-mortar stores. While we experienced Omicron-related disruptions in the first few weeks of the quarter, it was a significant improvement from the prior year period when roughly 50% of our physical stores were closed due to COVID.\nDigital commerce comps declined slightly on top of an outsized 79% comp last year when the widespread store closures shifted a disproportionate share of business online. We expect growth in both owned and wholesale digital in fiscal '23, driven by further site expansion and our healthy partnerships despite strong compares. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, up 5% on a reported basis and 12% in constant currency on top of a 41% reported growth last year, driven by stronger sellout and reorder trends.\nIn the fourth quarter, we suspended our wholesale shipments to Russia and also paused operations in Ukraine, given the devastating events unfolding there. Combined, these markets represented less than 1% of company sales prior to the war. We are not assuming any sales to these countries in our fiscal '23 outlook. While Europe remains our most dynamic market heading into fiscal '23, due to macro pressures and the war, our business remains fundamentally healthy, our consumers are resilient and our teams continue to execute with agility.\nTurning to Asia. Full year fiscal '22 represents our highest ever revenue and operating profit for the region. Combined with 5 consecutive years of AUR growth and the highest AURs in the company, Asia gives us strong confidence in the brand elevating ecosystem model we implemented over 4 years ago. These results, in the midst of ongoing COVID impacts, are especially strong and a testament to the outstanding work of our teams.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenue increased 20% on a reported basis and 26% in constant currency. Asia retail comps grew 12% with digital commerce increasing 46% and brick-and-mortar stores up 10%. We maintained strong momentum across our total digital ecosystem in the region with more than 50% growth this quarter. This was supported by gains across our own sites and wholesale digital businesses.\nAll of our key markets in Asia increased double digits in constant currency this quarter, led by 45% growth in Korea. And despite COVID-related disruptions, our Chinese Mainland sales grew 27%, while Japan sales increased 17% to last year. Both markets accelerated sequentially despite stricter containment measures across our top cities. Roughly 40% of our own stores in China experienced some form of closure or operating restrictions late in this quarter.\nOverall, we continue to see meaningful near- and long-term growth opportunities for our business in China, where our brands are resonating with consumers, and the underlying health of our business remains strong while we are still navigating COVID disruptions, particularly in China, continued momentum across Japan, Korea and Australia are helping to offset these near-term headwinds.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage that gives us the flexibility to balance strategic investments with returning cash to shareholders and opportunistic M&A, even through these dynamic times. This year, we returned approximately $600 million in dividends and share repurchases and ended the year with $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt. This compares to $2.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year.\nNet inventory increased 29% to support continued strong demand coming out of the pandemic, a deliberate increase in goods in transit as we take inventory earlier to help mitigate supply chain delays, particularly in wholesale; increased product costs, including freight and cotton, which we will start to lap in the second half of fiscal '23; and continued elevation of our product mix. We are managing inventory carefully in this dynamic environment in order to satisfy growing consumer demand and to maintain our long-term growth and quality of sales trajectory.\nLooking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including disruptions from inflationary pressures, the global supply chain, COVID-19, foreign currency volatility and the war in Ukraine. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency revenues to increase high single digits, with our current outlook at about 8% versus fiscal '22 on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on current spot rates, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points.\nLast year's 53rd week negatively impacts fiscal '23 growth by about 100 basis points in constant currency in addition to the headwind from foreign currency impact. We currently expect all 3 regions to drive positive revenue growth this year with the largest dollar contribution from North America and highest growth rate in Asia.\nOur top line outlook also includes significant foreign currency headwinds primarily related to the euro and the Japanese yen, especially in the first half of the year; potentially softer consumer sentiment in Europe from inflationary headwinds and the war with no sales to Russia or Ukraine assumed this year; COVID impact, notably in China, where we expect key city lockdowns to continue through the first quarter of fiscal '23; and a limited contribution from foreign tourist sales.\nWe expect operating margin in the range of 14% to 14.5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 130 basis points. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis last year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is expected to increase 30 to 50 basis points on a constant currency 52-week basis, in line with our long-term plan. We plan to continue driving stronger AUR and favorable product and channel mix, more than offsetting increased freight and material costs.\nForeign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 110 basis points in fiscal '23. We expect first half gross margins to be lower with the highest freight pressures in Q2, followed by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year as we start to lap the significant increases in freight and raw material costs. For the first quarter, we expect revenue growth in a range centered around 8% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 480 to 500 basis points. Our first quarter outlook reflects known COVID-related restrictions, notably in China.\nWe expect first quarter operating margin in a range centered around 13.5% in constant currency, reflecting increased headwinds from higher freight and marketing expense which are expected to normalize in the second half of the year as we start to lap cost increases from the prior year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by about 130 basis points in the quarter.\nFirst quarter gross margin is expected to contract slightly to last year in constant currency, with strong AUR growth more than offset by increased freight and product costs, along with more normalized channel mix compared to last year's store closures. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by about 100 basis points in the first quarter. We expect our tax rate in the range of 25% to 26% for the full year and 24% to 25% for the first quarter.\nLastly, our capital allocation priorities remain largely unchanged, with a focus on reinvesting behind our key strategic initiatives and returning excess cash flow to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. We completed approximately $150 million in share buybacks in the fourth quarter, with $1.6 billion remaining on our current authorization. And we recently raised our dividend for fiscal '23 by 9% to $3 per share. We are planning fiscal '23 capital expenditures of approximately $290 million to $310 million or around 4% to 5% of sales.\nIn closing, our teams around the world continue to execute with agility to drive brand desirability and deliver growth across multiple levers, all while navigating a still volatile global environment. Our strong performance this year underscores the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, our strengthening consumer base and the power of our brand. As we accelerate our top line momentum, we remain strongly committed to balancing our pivot to offense with long-term profitability, leveraging our culture of operating discipline that has been embedded across our organization over the last 4 years.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We were pleased to report strong third quarter performance during the important holiday season. Our better-than-expected results across all 3 regions are a testament to the outstanding work our teams have done to fundamentally reposition our business, elevate our brand and pivot to offense, including in North America, where our turnaround is well underway.\nOur significant reset work is behind us. Our brand is strong, and our growth is supported by multiple levers, from geographic and channel expansion to recruiting new higher-value consumers and developing high potential product categories. While we expect these growth levers to be sustainable and deliver in the future, they are already driving profitable growth, with all of our regions reporting positive increases to last year and pre-pandemic levels. And we delivered this broad-based performance while many of our markets around the world are still managing through the impacts of COVID.\nLet me share a few highlights from the third quarter across the 5 strategic pillars that we outlined at the start of our next great chapter plan. First, on our efforts to win over a new generation, consumers around the world are connecting more than ever to our brand positioning and product portfolio. Together with our multifaceted strategy for demand creation honed through the pandemic, we are engaging both new and existing consumers in exciting wins. This is particularly evident in our fiscal third quarter, where we shifted a significant portion of this year's investments to drive brand momentum across a diverse range of activities.\nFrom celebrity activations to the metaverse, we drove a significant increase in digital share of voice globally. These activations not only drove our strong top line outperformance in the quarter, but also help recruit younger full-price consumers to the brand, particularly on our digital channels. New consumers on our digital sites grew 58% to LLY, including an increased penetration of next-generation under 35 and higher-value consumers.\nFor the critical holiday period, our brand tracking data showed that our high-impact campaigns further increased consumer perceptions of Ralph Lauren as a key destination for gifting in all regions. Online search trends across our family of brands also grew strong double digits to last year, significantly outperforming peers in our largest markets in Q3.\nSome of the innovative holiday campaigns that drove brand heat and enabled consumers to engage with and shop our brand in new ways included: first, we expanded our leadership in the metaverse with our Ralph Lauren Winter Escape program on Roblox, where we recreated the world of Ralph Lauren with an immersive holiday theme user experience and exclusive digital apparel collection for purchase. Roblox is one of the top interactive digital platforms in the world, and particularly for Gen Z, with 47 million users. This follows last quarter's World of Ralph Lauren launch on another popular Metaverse, ZEPETO, where we continue to gain traction with over 2.5 million visits to date and maintain the #1 rank among all brands on the platform. You may have seen our mobile pop-ups and synchronized drone shows in select cities this holiday, featuring hundreds of drones lighting up the night sky to celebrate the return of festive dressing and our customizable gifts.\nWe also drove highly successful live streaming events during the quarter, including our brand elevating Singles Day and FARFETCH holiday live streams. In China, we continue to leverage our work with key influencers, accompanying the launch of our first major fragrance in the market this fall, our collaboration with popular actor and singer, Xiao Zhan, sold 40,000 units of Ralph's Club Fragrance in a 6-hour period in December.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we will continue to drive this momentum with iconic brand moments in sports and culture, including our Spring '22 fashion show in New York, our sponsorship of Team USA in the Winter Olympics opening today, and our second year sponsoring the Australian Open, all of which you will see amplified across our global digital campaigns.\nMoving to our second key initiative, energize core products and accelerate high potential underdeveloped categories. Ralph created the quintessential American luxury lifestyle brand more than 50 years ago. His vision is one that has always been about a world to aspire to rather than any single product category or fashion cycle. While the Polo brand and elevated sportswear still sit at the heart of what we do, Ralph Lauren is one of the few brands in the marketplace with the authenticity, quality and credibility to deliver products ranging from fleeced hoodies to evening gowns and from accessories to home.\nOur multi-category lifestyle proposition affords us the flexibility and competitive advantage to deliver for consumers whatever the backdrop. And this flexibility enables us to be agile as consumers shift their wardrobes to a new hybrid mix of elevated but comfortable casual styles, for example, mixing our women's cashmere joggers with our sophisticated (inaudible) tuxedo jacket. Our fall holiday performance in Q3 is a great example of how Ralph and our design teams are effectively capturing this mix, which is translating into market share gains around the world.\nLet me share just a few of these highlights. Our Boston Common apparel collection introduced an expanded assortment of elevated heritage icons driving strong sales in our stores with our most aspirational consumers. Our holiday Cortina collection set (inaudible) Alpine style in a sophisticated palette of blues and white. We drove a strong return of our sweater business with an expanded offering of our iconic cashmere styles, along with the introduction of new modern active hybrid models. And we continue to drive outsized performance in outerwear, one of our high-potential categories, which has grown about 50% since the start of our next great chapter strategy.\nQ3 outerwear sales were fueled by an expanded range of active insulated models, including our newest collection of RLX performance for men as well as elevated shirting, wools, and cashmere for women. As we continue to drive brand heat and new consumer acquisition, special capsules this quarter included: Black on Black our latest limited-edition Major League baseball drop; our bold new U.S. Olympics capsule, inspiring a new generation with looks rooted in active and performance outerwear, fleece and mitts; and for our brand loyalist on the Polo app, our 7 days, 7 drops Polo bear skateboard decks with Gossip Girl star and skateboarder Evan Mark kicking off the event at our Prince Street store.\nShifting gears to our third key initiative, drive targeted expansion in our regions and channels. We continued our long-term strategy of investing in our brand elevating key city ecosystems around the world in the third quarter with 40 new stores and concessions opening in top cities globally. This included our first European flagship opening since 2010 in Milan with early performance beating our plans by double digits. The majority of our store openings were in Asia and particularly the Chinese Mainland, where our brand momentum remains very strong despite recurring COVID shutdowns. Our Mainland sales were still up more than 20% to last year and 65% of LLY in constant currency.\nThe highly innovative emblematic concept stores we opened in Beijing and Shanghai earlier this year, continued to perform ahead of our expectations, lifting overall growth trends in their respective city ecosystems, and our Singles Day performance significantly outpaced the competition despite our less promotional approach. As we start to expand our successful key city ecosystem blue trends around the world, we were particularly excited to open 4 new full price stores in North America this quarter in Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Detroit. This represents our highest number of full-price store openings in North America in 6 years and commences a new phase of retail growth in our home market following several years of repositioning.\nHaving substantially reset the profitability of our full price fleet over the past year through enhanced category offerings new ways of selling and operational discipline, we are moving forward with our plan to open about a dozen new margin-accretive full-price stores in North America over the next couple of years.\nMoving to our priority of leading with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, grew more than 40% in the third quarter in constant currency and more than 60% to LLY, ahead of our plan. Within our own sites, digital sales grew more than 30%. This was driven primarily by full-priced holiday selling as we deliver the right mix of product, pull back on promotions and invest in AI-powered targeting and new full-price consumer acquisition. We continue to scale and expand on the connected retail capabilities we launched during the pandemic from virtual selling appointments to Buy Online, Pick Up in Store, to end-of-aisle product availability. We launched our first ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile shopping app in time for holiday, seamlessly leveraging our connected retail capabilities to deliver our most personalized and content-rich platform to date.\nNow touching on our work to operate with discipline to fuel growth. Our teams continue to operate with agility to mitigate macro headwinds, delivering better-than-expected gross and operating margins again in the third quarter. The global operating environment remains highly dynamic, notably with COVID, supply chain and cost inflation still pressure points coming into calendar 2022. However, we remain confident in our ability to manage these headwinds, to deliver further growth and operating margin expansion through our proven pricing power as well as our culture of cost discipline. This discipline is helping us to fuel our strategic investments in long-term growth.\nAnd further, part of investing in our business also includes a commitment to investing in our people and innovation. A few recent highlights include the following: in December, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation announced a $2 million donation in scholarships for students at historically black colleges and universities. This is part of our broader commitment to invest directly in the future of black students with enhanced access to education and advancing our recruitment and development programs for black talent.\nWe were also recently proud to achieve a score of 100% once again on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index and earned the designation as the Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality. On the sustainability front, just a few weeks ago, we were incredibly excited to launch our first product made with CLARUS, a first-to-market patented technology that uses recycled cotton to create a high-performance fabric, developed by natural fiber welding, which we announced an investment in last year, CLARUS has all the features we've come to expect from synthetic performance materials like comfort, breathability and moisture management while reducing our reliance on synthetics that use fossil fuels such as polyester and nylon. This is a critical step in scaling our use of recycled content and making progress on our target of sustainably sourcing 100% of our key materials, including cotton by 2025.\nThis latest launch comes on the heels of our groundbreaking introduction last year of Color on Demand, the world's first scalable zero wastewater cotton dying system. And lastly, we announced an exciting new limited partnership with Franklin Venture Partners in Silicon Valley, focused on female-led businesses, the partnership backed disruptive technologies and consumer solutions with the potential to positively transform the fashion industry. Like our investment in natural fiber welding, this move underscores our long-standing commitments to innovation, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nIn closing, Ralph and I are incredibly proud of the performance our teams have delivered through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. All channels and geographies are showing strong momentum as we build on an increasingly healthy foundation, leveraging work that we started well before the pandemic, but accelerated through this time of challenge. Looking ahead, we are focused on driving sustainable growth supported by continued investments across digital, our brand building and more personalized demand creation as well as key markets and categories. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day this summer.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.\n\nJane Hamilton Nielsen\n\nCFO & COO, Ralph Lauren Corporation\n\nThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations. Our growth was broad-based across multiple levers in our business and delivered improved operating margin and profit growth of 52%. Consumer response to our fall and holiday offerings was strong and our teams are navigating supply chain challenges with agility. Their passion and tireless work produced strong progress across each of our key strategic initiatives. .\nWe were particularly encouraged to report North America's pivot back to high-quality revenue and operating profit growth versus pre-pandemic levels, continued double-digit growth across Europe and Asia businesses and strong digital momentum, all while investing for growth and delivering both growth and operating margin expansion.\nWe continue to generate strong cash flow and increased our cash returns to shareholders in the form of our dividend and share repurchases. Importantly, we achieved these results in the context of navigating a still uncertain macro environment. Total company revenues increased 27% to last year, with positive growth in every region, led by North America and Europe. Compared to third quarter fiscal '20 or LLY revenues increased 4%. This 4% includes 7 points of negative impact from last year's strategic reset of our distribution and our Chaps business, which moved to a license model, implying low double-digit growth to LLY on an underlying basis.\nStrong and highly profitable growth continued in our digital ecosystems. Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem sales grew more than 40% in constant currency to last year and more than 60% to LLY. This includes more than 30% growth in our owned digital business reflecting our strong product assortments, new consumer acquisition expanded connected retail capabilities and high-impact marketing. Digital margins remain strongly accretive to our third quarter profitability.\nTotal company adjusted gross margin was 66% in the third quarter, up 60 basis points to last year on a reported basis and 90 basis points in constant currency, despite increased freight headwinds of approximately 150 basis points. Gross margins were better than expected despite lapping last year's unusual COVID mix benefits, driven by better pricing and promotions along with favorable product mix. Adjusted gross margins increased 380 basis points to LLY.\nOur brand elevation work continued with third quarter AUR up 18% on top of 19% growth last year, with increases across every region. Driven by favorable product mix and strong pricing power in the marketplace, we are confident in our ability to navigate this inflationary cycle. We expect to continue growing AUR above our long-term targets into fiscal '23 to mitigate mid- to high single-digit product cost inflation. Adjusted operating expenses increased 22% to 50.1% of sales, a 210 basis point decline to last year, but a 190 basis point increase to LLY on increased marketing investments.\nMarketing grew 78% to 8% of sales in the third quarter to support a number of initiatives around holiday, our digital expansion into new markets and categories and new consumer acquisition. As discussed last quarter, we shifted a significant portion of our marketing investments from the first half to the second half of the year to accelerate our brand momentum and direct-to-consumer expansion coming out of the pandemic. We expect a similar level of marketing dollar spend in the fourth quarter to support our Spring '22, Lunar New Year and digital campaigns, including our new Ralph Lauren mobile app and digital home shop.\nOther fourth quarter activations include Beijing Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, as well as our continued focus on high-value new consumer acquisition. Based on increased confidence in our demand creation activities, we now expect marketing in the range of 7% to 7.5% of fiscal '22 sales. This year's elevated level of investment is supporting increased content creation, new consumer acquisition, our digital launches, new store openings and key brand moments coming out of the peak of the pandemic.\nAdjusted operating margin for the third quarter was 15.9%, up 260 basis points to last year and 190 basis points to LLY. This was above our guidance of 13% to 13.5% margin, driven by stronger gross margins and operating expense leverage on higher sales.\nMoving to segment performance, starting with North America. A very strong holiday selling season accelerated third quarter revenue to 30% growth to last year, with both wholesale and retail performing significantly above our expectations. This was driven by improved product assortments, new full-price consumers and market share gains. These strong results reinforce our confidence in North America as a driver of growth into the future. Compared to LLY, North America revenues increased 2%, a meaningful improvement from first half trends. These results included a 15-point headwind from our strategic distribution reset and Chaps, implying even stronger high-teens growth to pre-COVID levels on an underlying basis.\nWhile resets are expected to have an even larger impact on our reported North America revenues in Q4, we expect continued sequential improvement on an underlying basis to LLY. In North America Retail, comps grew 38% to last year and 9% to LLY. Comps increased on improved traffic conversion and 24% AUR growth, reflecting our continued elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions.\nBrick-and-mortar comps accelerated to 40%, driven by double-digit growth in AUR, basket sizes and traffic. We were particularly encouraged by improved trends in our factory stores, which have been disproportionately impacted by weaker traffic through the pandemic, including a lack of foreign tourist travel. While U.S. border restrictions were eased in early November, Q3 foreign tourist sales still declined 35% to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to monitor for potential impacts from Omicron and other variants closely.\nWe drove further momentum in our own digital commerce business this quarter with comps up 32%, supported by strong full-priced holiday selling. Our continued focus on full price new consumer acquisition helped deliver larger basket sizes at significantly higher quality of sales on our site.\nIn North America wholesale, revenues increased 11% to last year, including a 16-point negative impact from our deliberate resets and Chaps. Underlying growth and quality of sales continued to exceed our expectations for the quarter, led by our full price businesses. Total sellout was up 25% to LLY in the third quarter, led by continued market share gains in men's, kids, home and women's ready to wear in our key partners. Our brand elevation in this channel continued with wholesale AUR up more than 30% to LLY this fall as we elevated our assortments and pulled back on seasonal promotions. And our momentum on wholesale.com drove digital sell-out growth of more than 35% to last year and 50% to LLY. Inventories at our full-price North America department store partners remained very healthy and clean at the end of the quarter, declining more than 20% to LLY.\nMoving on to Europe. Third quarter revenue increased 47% on a reported basis and 50% in constant currency, above our expectations. On a LLY basis, revenue growth accelerated 6% with stronger performance in France and the U.K. more than offsetting COVID-related restrictions in Germany and the Netherlands near the end of the quarter. Europe comps increased 55%. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 68%, with double-digit increases across all markets. Digital commerce comps increased 27% on top of a challenging 68% last year when COVID-related closures shifted more business online.\nEurope wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, driven by stronger sellout and reorder trends across wholesale brick-and-mortar and dot com. We launched 30 campaigns with our top partners to deliver 500 million impressions over the quarter, including special holiday gifting experiences.\nTurning to Asia. Revenue increased 16% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency. This quarter represents our highest ever revenue and operating profit for the region despite ongoing COVID impacts. Our Asia retail comps increased 14%, with 64% growth in digital commerce and 12% growth in brick-and-mortar stores. Performance exceeded our expectations going into the quarter, primarily due to strong recovery trends across every key market led by Japan and Korea.\nChina Mainland sales remained robust despite government-mandated COVID controls in certain areas. Mainland sales grew 22% to last year, including 2 points of negative impact from COVID closures in the quarter and grew 65% to LLY. Our digital ecosystem momentum also continued in Asia this quarter with triple-digit growth to LLY. This was supported by key events like Singles' Day and our 12/12 activations, where our brands ranked #2 on both Tmall's Luxury Pavilion and JD luxury platform.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt, which compares to $2.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.6 billion in total debt last year. Net inventory increased 7%, slightly below our plan due to ongoing global supply chain delays, which will shift some inventories into our fiscal Q4. While still highly dynamic, we are seeing some improvement on lead times and our inventories are well positioned to meet demand for the spring season, thanks to the agility of our teams and a flexible inventory allocation process.\nWe now expect to end the fiscal year with inventories roughly in line with sales growth to support the upcoming Spring '22 season. Overall, we continue to manage our inventories closely to demand in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. Looking ahead, our outlook is based on our best assessment of the current macro environment, including global supply chain challenges, Omicron and other COVID-related disruptions. For the full year fiscal '22, we are again raising our top line outlook based on stronger-than-expected demand across geographies. We now expect revenues to grow in the range of 39% to 41% in constant currency, up from 34% to 36% previously, all on a 53-week basis. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 70 basis points.\nWe are also raising our operating margin outlook to approximately 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis, up from 12% to 12.5% previously, reflecting our stronger performance through the first 3 quarters of the year. Compared to fiscal '20, or LLY, our updated outlook now implies we are on track to end this year with full year revenues roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels, despite about 10 points of headwind from our strategic reset, operating margin more than 250 basis points higher and profit dollars expanding by more than $175 million as we grow off a healthier and more profitable base.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect constant currency revenues to increase about 17% to 18%. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by about 400 basis points. We expect gross margin expansion of about 160 to 180 basis points in constant currency, or 50 to 70 basis points on a reported basis. Continued growth in AUR should more than offset increased freight and material costs.\nWe expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 80 basis points to 4.2% in constant currency with continued gross margin expansion more than offsetting increased marketing investments to fuel future growth. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. We expect fourth quarter and full year tax rate around 21% to 22%.\nLastly, our capital allocation priorities remain largely unchanged, with a focus on reinvesting behind our key strategic initiatives and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed $300 million in share buybacks in the third quarter with approximately $280 million remaining on our current authorization, plus an additional $1.5 billion repurchase plan recently approved by our Board.\nIn closing, our teams around the world are operating with agility and passion to drive brand desirability and deliver growth across multiple levers, all while navigating a still volatile global environment. Our strong year-to-date performance underscores the timelessness of Ralph's creative vision, our strengthening consumer base and the power of our brand. We are playing offense to leverage our momentum and invest in the key strategic initiatives to support our long-term growth and value creation.\nWith that, let's open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Moderna Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's third quarter 2025 and financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we will be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website. On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer. .\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a quick review of the quarter. Jamey will present our financial results and outlook. Stephen will review our commercial progress and clinical programs and then I will share our key value drivers as we look ahead before we take your questions.\nIn the third quarter, our revenue were $1 billion, driven by sales of our free approved vaccines, Spikevax [indiscernible]. The net loss for the quarter was $200 million. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash and investments. We remain highly focused on financial discipline. I'm pleased to announce that continued cost reduction efforts across the company in the third quarter of 2025 led to a 34% reduction of cost of sales, R&D and SG&A combined compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we made good progress across our 3 strategic priorities. Our first priority is driving use of our commercial products. For Spikevax, our original COVID vaccine, we received approval in 40 countries for the seasonal 2025-2026 train update. And next [indiscernible], our new COVID vaccine was approved this year by the FDA. We also filed and received approval for the 2025-2026 strand update in the U.S. making this the first season that mNEXSPIKE is available in the United States.\nWe also received approval for mNEXSPIKE in Canada. For [indiscernible] vaccine, Asia will continue to gain regulatory approval and mRESVIA is now approved in 40 countries. We have a strategic partnership with 3 countries, Canada, the U.K. and Australia, where we have established manufacturing facilities and secured a multiyear offtake agreements. In each of these countries, we have achieved important milestones. In Canada, we delivered the first made in Canada, mRNA vaccines to the Canadian government for used this season.\nIn the U.K. and Australia, our facilities were granted licenses by their respective regulatory agencies. Second priority, advancing pipeline to grab sales growth. We announced in July, positive Phase III full efficacy data which we believe will advance both our flu vaccine program, mRNA-1010 and our flu plus COVID combination program, mRNA-1083. For the flu plus COVID combination program, our filing continues to be under review by the European Medicines Agency.\nIn Oncology portfolio at the European Society of Medical Oncology, ESMO, Congress in October, we presented encouraging Phase Ib data for cancer antigen therapy, mRNA-4359. Unfortunately, we also announced recently that despite the progress made by the Safe community in understanding the CMV virus our CMV program did not meet its primary efficacy endpoints for conceal -- we will discontinue the development of our CMV vaccine in this indication.\nThird priority, executing with financial discipline. The team continues to diligently advance our cost improvement program. Over the last 4 quarters, Q4 2024 to Q3 2025, we delivered a $2.1 billion improvement in costs across cost of goods, SG&A and R&D versus the prior 4 quarters. I want to thank the entire Moderna team for this great achievement, and we continue to work on prioritizing our ID pipeline, growing productivity equaling by the use of more digital tools including a large number of GPs, also better pricing with our suppliers across the entire company.\nThanks to this good progress and momentum, we've reduced projected 2025 cash cost by approximately $500 million since just the last quarter investor call in August 2025. And by approximately $900 million since the beginning of the year. With this, I will hand over to Jamey.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Stefan, and hello, everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter and share our outlook for the remainder of 2025. Let's start by reviewing our commercial performance, which you can follow on Slide 7. Year-to-date, total revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, with $900 million from the U.S. and the remainder from international markets. In addition to product sales, revenue also includes collaboration, grant and Stan ready revenue associated with our strategic partnerships.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, our total revenue was $1 billion, U.S. revenue was $800 million in the third quarter, the vast majority of which was from our COVID vaccines, which included the successful launch of our new COVID vaccine mNEXSPIKE. Stephen will give more detail on the U.S. COVID vaccination season at a moment. Revenue outside the U.S. was $200 million. Approximately half of international revenue in Q3 was delivered to Canada. -- where we began executing on our strategic partnership through our in-country manufacturing facility.\nAs a reminder, we have similar strategic partnerships with the Australian and U.K. governments and expect to begin shipping locally manufactured product in 4Q '25 and 1Q '26, respectively. For the full year 2025 outlook, we are narrowing our revenue range to $1.6 billion to $2 billion from our previous guidance of $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. For the U.S. market, we expect fourth quarter sales of $100 million to $400 million. This would bring our updated full year U.S. revenue guidance to $1 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior guidance of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.\nOur original guidance assumed year-over-year revenue to be flat to down 33%, excluding onetime items. Our updated guidance now assumes a year-over-year decline of 15% to 33%. COVID vaccination rates remain the largest variable to this range, which Stephen will walk through in a moment. For international markets, we now expect revenue to be between $300 million and $400 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $600 million to $700 million versus our previous guidance of $500 million to $700 million.\nWe have a tighter range on our international sales as most of these sales are for contracted volumes leaving delivery timing and file vaccination rates as the only remaining variables. Moving to Slide 8, I will review our 3Q financial results in more detail. Total revenue was $1 billion in the quarter, as I just discussed on the prior page. We had net product sales of $973 million and other revenue of $43 million from grants, collaborations, royalties and stand ready fees. The 45% year-over-year decline in revenue was expected and primarily reflects lower COVID vaccine demand.\nIt's also worth noting that last year's third quarter included approximately $140 million from a true-up adjustment to prior period sales provisions. That benefit did not repeat in Q3 this year. Cost of sales for the third quarter was $207 million, representing 21% net product sales for the quarter. This was a 60% year-over-year decrease in our cost of sales from $514 million in Q3 last year. The improvement was driven by lower inventory write-downs, reduced unutilized manufacturing capacity and lower volume. Overall, these results reflect the productivity gains and the efficiency improvements we've achieved in our manufacturing operations.\nR&D expenses in the third quarter were $801 million, a 30% decrease from last year. The reduction mainly reflects lower clinical trial costs as we completed several large Phase III studies in our vaccine portfolio as well as efficiency gains across the organization. Last year's results also included an expense related to the purchase of a priority review voucher. SG&A expenses were $268 million in the third quarter, a 5% decrease year-over-year. The decline mainly reflects lower consulting and external service costs across multiple functions, along with reduced digital and facility spending. These savings reflect the cost discipline we've built into the organization and our continued focus on streamlining how we operate.\nOur income tax provision for the quarter was immaterial, consistent with the prior year. We continue to maintain a global valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets, which limits our ability to recognize tax benefits from losses. Net loss for the quarter was $200 million compared to net income of $13 million in Q3 2024. Loss per share was $0.51 compared to earnings per share of $0.03 last year. We ended Q3 with cash and investments of $6.6 billion, down from $7.5 billion at the end of Q2. The decrease was primarily driven by seasonal impact to working capital.\nWith that, let me take a minute to share the progress we've made on our cost reduction goals. As a reminder, our original target this year was to reduce our GAAP operating expenses from $7.2 billion in 2024 to $6.4 billion in 2025. On a cash cost basis, excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and other noncash charges, that represented a decrease from $6.3 billion in 2024 to $5.5 billion. I'm happy to report that we are now on track to beat our 2025 cost plan by over $1 billion on a GAAP basis and by $900 million on a cash cost basis, both at the midpoint of our projections.\nDuring our previous 2Q call, we have lowered our GAAP and cash cost by $400 million each, with GAAP costs lowered from $6.4 billion to $6 billion, and cash costs lowered from $5.5 billion to $5.1 billion. Today, we are further lowering our 2025 expense guidance due to additional progress across the company to drive efficiency gains and continued investment prioritization. Our GAAP operating expense guidance is being reduced by another $700 million from $6 billion to $5.3 billion at the midpoint. This reduction is $500 million of cash costs, plus $200 million of noncash reductions in stock-based compensation and depreciation.\nThe $700 million GAAP reduction from prior guidance is split evenly between cost of sales and R&D. We are lowering our cost of sales forecast by $300 million to $400 million from $1.2 billion to a range of $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion, which reflects an acceleration of the efficiency programs we are targeting as part of our multiyear cost-out plan. We are also lowering our R&D expense range to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion and approximately $350 million improvement due to continued investment prioritization and efficiency gains in the execution of our clinical trials. In just 2 years, we expect to reduce our cash cost by approximately 50% from nearly $9 billion in 2023 and to $4.6 billion in 2025. We are now ahead of our plans, and we'll update improvements to our 2026 and 2027 targets at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 20.\nImportantly, we continue to target cash breakeven in 2028. I would like to take this moment to thank all my Moderna colleagues for their hard work and commitment to improve the financial profile of our company. Moving to Slide 10. I will share our updated 2025 financial framework. For total revenue, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are narrowing our range to $1.6 billion to $2 billion. From our previous guidance of $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion. For cost of sales, our updated guidance is $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion, an improvement from our previous guidance of $1.2 billion. This updated range assumes a higher cost of sales in 4Q versus 3Q, which factors in similar sales volume and higher unutilized manufacturing charges.\nNewly introduced tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on our business, but we continue to monitor changes to global tariffs. Our revised R&D range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, projects an increase in 4Q spend due to the seasonality of vaccine trial spend as well as studies in support of regulatory approvals. SG&A expenses are expected to be $1.1 billion, similar to last year, we expect SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter to increase primarily due to commercial related activity. We expect taxes to be negligible in 2025. We expect our capital expenditures are also supposed to be approximately $300 million. We are increasing our year-end cash guidance to $6.5 billion to $7 billion, an increase of $0.5 billion to $1 billion from our prior guidance of approximately $6 billion.\nThis increase is projected to increase year-end cash due to the reduction in our operating expense for the year. In summary, we have made strong financial progress against our 2025 financial objectives. We have tightened our sales range because of increased visibility into our seasonal sales. And we have lowered our 2025 cash cost estimate by $900 million from $5.5 billion to $4.6 billion, resulting in a higher projected year-end cash balance of $6.5 billion to $7 billion.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Jamey, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review our current commercial positioning in the U.S. as well as our progress across our pipeline. As you know, COVID vaccine sales still represent the vast majority of our revenues. And as Jamey pointed out earlier, the U.S. is our largest market in 2025. .\nSlide 12 reviews the U.S. COVID vaccination market during the fall of '24 and the cumulative vaccinations to date for the retail channel for the fall of '25 as reported by IQVIA. As a reminder, the retail channel represented 72% of the total vaccinations in the fall of 2024. We expect this segment will represent a similar proportion of the market in 2025. As Jamey noted earlier, our U.S. revenue guidance is $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is based on our preseason expectation for a 20% to 40% decline from fall 2024 retail vaccinations of approximately $26 million.\nAs of October 24, and of this year, cumulative retail vaccinations were $13.2 million, down approximately 30% year-over-year and well within the 20% to 40% decline we had assumed in our 2025 U.S. revenue outlook. Moving to Slide 13. Our COVID retail market share is 42%, up 2 percentage points from last year. We are most pleased by the strong market uptake for mNEXSPIKE even given a midyear launch. mNEXSPIKE now makes up 55% of our COVID vaccination volume.\nSlide 14 is a summary of our prioritized pipeline. This pipeline now consists of 3 approved products, 2 programs with positive Phase III results and 5 more candidates in clinical studies with registrational potential.\nMoving to Slide 15, which outlines the latest developments in our late-stage respiratory portfolio, I think to start with our COVID vaccines. As mentioned earlier, Spikevax updated 2025, 2026 formula is now approved in 40 countries. For mNEXSPIKE, we received approval for the 25-26 formula in the U.S. And we are also approved in Canada. We have also applied for approval in Europe, Australia, Taiwan and Japan and would expect to launch in those countries in the '26, '27 seasons. For mRESVIA, our RSV vaccine, it has been approved for adult age 60 and older in 40 countries and also approved for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59 in 31 of those 40 countries. We recently presented multiple data sets from the mRESVIA clinical program at IDWeek. For our flu vaccine candidate, MRNA-1010, we expect to complete regulatory submissions for approval in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe by January 2026. The -- the positive results from our Phase III vaccine efficacy trial were presented at both ID Week and the European Scientific Working Group on influenza or as we, this past month. Moving on to mRNA-1083. Our combination flu covid vaccine candidate. Our filing for approval is under review with the European Medicines Agency. And we expect to refile with Health Canada by the end of 2025.\nIn the U.S., we are awaiting further guidance from the FDA on our plans to refile. We presented Phase III immunogenicity subanalyses for our flu COVID combination program at [indiscernible]. Now turning to our nonrespiratory vaccine and rare disease portfolios. Our ongoing Phase III norovirus study has not yet accrued sufficient cases needed to conduct the interim analysis after the first season. And as a result, we will proceed to enroll a second Northern Hemisphere season this winter.\nAs before, the timing of the Phase III readout will be dependent upon accruing sufficient cases to trigger the interim analysis. For mRNA-1647, as we announced in late October, we did not meet the primary endpoint for prevention of infection in our Phase III CMV efficacy study. We are discontinuing development in congenital CMV. However, we will continue to evaluate mRNA-1647 in an ongoing Phase II trial in patients who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation.\nIn rare diseases, I'm happy to announce that we have reached target enrollment of the registrational study for our propionic acidemia or PA program. We also had the opportunity to present data from our ongoing Phase I/II study at the International Congress of inborn errors of metabolism medical meeting during the quarter. For methamolonic acidemia, or MMA, we presented interim data from the Phase I/II trial at that same meeting, and we expect our MMA registrational trial to start in 2026.\nTurning now to our oncology portfolio. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our programs. For entisparan, which is partnered with Merck, we have several late-stage studies underway. Our Phase III trial in adjuvant melanoma is fully enrolled and accruing events towards its interim analysis. Our Phase II adjuvant renal cell carcinoma trial is also fully enrolled. And as we have disclosed previously, we have 2 Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer and multiple randomized Phase II studies, including a Phase II study in high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer and a Phase II study in high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, all of which are still enrolling.\nWe've also expanded our entizimirin program into the metastatic study with a Phase II study in first-line metastatic melanoma and a recently opened Phase II study in first-line metastatic squamous non-smelter cell lung cancer. Both these studies are randomized trials. Neoantigen from neoangine analysis from our Phase II adjuvant melanoma trial was presented at the Society for Melanoma Research meeting in October. Now moving to mRNA-4359, which is enrolling a Phase II study in first-line metastatic melanoma and first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients. The decision to proceed to that phase -- into those Phase II was based on encouraging Phase Ib data, some of which was presented at the recent ESMO Medical Congress.\nIn early-stage oncology, we are dosing patients in a Phase I trial for our cancer antigen therapy program, mRNA-4106. For for our T-cell engager program, mRNA-2808, I'm happy to announce that the first patient was dosed in the Phase I trial during the quarter. Finally, the IND for our cell therapy enhancer, mRNA-4203 is open, and we look forward to enrolling and dosing the first patient in that study. We're pleased by the growth and breadth of our clinical stage oncology pipeline and the continued strong momentum of the multiple Phase III and randomized Phase II trials within our intecmarin clinical trial program conducted in partnership with Merck.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stephen and Jamey. Looking at the 3 value drivers of our business: commercial, pipeline and financial. Commercially, we are seeing the benefit from market share gains of mNEXSPIKE, which we believe will continue in 2026 and beyond. Next year, our commercial business will benefit from the full year contribution from our strategic partnership in Canada, U.K. and Australia. From a pipeline standpoint, we look forward to potential approvals of our combination of flu plus COVID vaccine in Europe. The file is currently being reviewed. And in Canada, where we expect to revise soon.\nIn the U.S., we look forward to refiling further guidance from the FDA. Later this year, we filed our seasonal pro vaccine mRNA-1010 for approval in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the EU. We also expect to see 2 critical milestones from our Intismarin program. First, the 5-year follow-up data from our Phase II adjuvant melanoma study; and second, the efficacy data from our Phase III adjuvant animal study. We look forward to the Phase II data from our cancer [indiscernible]. We have to look forward to a Phase III efficacy data from norovirus vaccine and the restriction an efficacy study data for PA program propylitic acidemia in rare disease.\nWe have exercised strong financial disciplines so far this year -- we have ahead of our initial 2025 cash cost production by $900 million. We will continue to improve our cost structure and drive productivity. For [indiscernible] cash balance projection, we have increased our year-end projection to a range from $6.5 billion to $7 billion, up $500 million to $1 billion from our prior guidance of around $6 billion. We know that a higher cash balance to exit 2025 and a much ecostructure when we enter 2025 is the right strategy as we transition from a single pandemic product company to a large diversified portfolio of commercial products in seasonal vaccines, oncology medicines and rare disease medicines.\nIn closing, I want to recognize the entire Moderna team for their net less dedication to our mission. For our progress, scientific, clinical, commercial and operational is focused on our mission, delivering the greatest possible impact to people for mRNA medicines. With this, operator, we'll be happy to take questions.",

Welcome to Moderna's Second Quarter 2025 Conference Call.\nPlease be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Tulupta, Head of IR. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call to discuss Moderna's second quarter 2025 financial results and business update. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website. On today's call are Stephane Bamsell, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Jamie Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. With that, I'll now turn it over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a quick review of Q2. Jamie will present our financial results and outlook. Stephen will review our clinical programs, and then I will come back and share our key priorities and catalysts before we take your questions. Let me start with a review of our financials. In the second quarter, our revenues of $0.1 billion and a loss of $0.8 billion were in line with our expectations, and they reflect the highly seasonal nature of our respiratory vaccine business.\nWe ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and investments. We remain highly focused on financial discipline. I'm very pleased to announce that continued cost reduction efforts across the company in the second quarter of 2025 led to a 35% reduction of cost of sales, R&D and SG&A combined compared to the second quarter of 2024. As you know, we are very focused on cash cost, and I'm happy to report that on a cash cost basis, we reduced operating expenses by $581 million in Q2 2025 versus Q2 2024, which is a 40% reduction year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we made solid progress across our 3 strategic priorities. Priority one, driving use of our commercial products. We made strong progress in securing 3 approvals from the U.S. FDA. On May 31, we were very pleased to announce the FDA approval of m-NeXpike, our next-generation COVID vaccine that has shown even higher efficacy than our Spikevax vaccine. In mid-June, we received FDA approval of our mRESVIA vaccine for high-risk individual aged 18 to 59.\nAs a reminder, we are also approved for adults 60 and older in the U.S. and in 38 other countries. And in July, the FDA granted full approval of our Spikevax COVID vaccine for high-risk children aged 6 months through 11 years. This vaccine has previously been used under EUA. These approvals support our broader goal of driving use of our commercial products and driving the company back into sales growth. On our second priority, advancing our pipeline to drive sales growth. We are very happy to announce positive and strong Phase III efficacy data for flu, which we believe will advance both our flu program and our flu plus COVID combination program. Stephen will discuss these results shortly.\nAnd our third priority, executing with financial discipline. The second quarter 2025 marked the fourth consecutive quarter we have reduced combined R&D and SG&A expenses by double digits year-over-year. Additionally, in the second quarter, we expanded our cost reduction plan well beyond what we announced in the first quarter. We estimate that these measures will take an additional $400 million out of 2025 cost structure we previously laid out. This cost reduction includes a very difficult decision that we announced yesterday to reduce headcount by around 10% to better align Moderna cost structure and capabilities with current business conditions while also sustaining investments in our mRNA pipeline.\nThis decision was obviously not made lightly. It impacts people who have dedicated themselves to our mission, teammates and friends who have built Moderna. I want to express on behalf of the entire executive committee, our deepest thanks to all of those affected for what they have contributed to the company. These colleagues will always be part of the Moderna story. Finally, before I hand to Jamie, you may have seen that in the last couple of hours, the U.K. Court of Appeal issued its decision. The court has decided to uphold the High Court's finding that Moderna's EP-949 patent is valid and infringed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Moderna will continue to pursue and enforce its patent rights globally to protect its innovative mRNA technology. Jamie?\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Stefan, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll cover our second quarter financial results. our updated 2025 full year outlook and share our strategy to achieve our 2027 operating cost targets. Let's begin with our second quarter financial results on Slide 7. Net product sales were $114 million, primarily driven by COVID vaccine sales. The U.S. accounted for approximately 80% of sales this quarter with the remainder from international markets. While product sales declined 38% compared to the second quarter of 2024, sales were slightly above our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected U.S. spring booster season. .\nWe also recorded $28 million into the revenue, bringing total revenue to the quarter to $142 million. The year-over-year decline in other revenue was primarily driven by a $30 million upfront licensing payment that was recognized in the second quarter of last year. Cost of sales for the quarter was $119 million, which was relatively flat compared to $115 million last year. It represented 105% of net product sales this quarter, up from 62% in the prior year, driven primarily by lower volume.\nR&D expenses were $700 million in the second quarter, down 43% from last year. The decline was primarily driven by the wind down of our respiratory trials and lower clinical manufacturing costs. We also had year-over-year reductions in preclinical and external service costs, reflecting ongoing portfolio prioritization and productivity efforts. Last year's results also included an expense for a priority review voucher. SG&A expenses were $230 million for the quarter, down 14% year-over-year. The decrease reflects broad-based cost reductions across external services, personnel and commercial activities as we continue to streamline operations and manage expenses with discipline.\nOur income tax provision for the quarter was immaterial, consistent with the prior year. We continue to maintain a global valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets. which limits our ability to recognize tax benefits for the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $825 million, a $454 million improvement compared to a $1.3 billion loss in the second quarter of 2024. The Loss per share was $2.13, an improvement from a loss of $3.33 in 2024. We ended Q2 with cash and investments of $7.5 billion, down from $8.4 billion at the end of Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the operating loss for the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8, I will share our updated 2025 financial framework. For total revenue, we are updating our 2025 projected revenue range to $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion, reflecting a $300 million reduction at the high end. This change is primarily due to a timing shift of U.K. COVID shipments from the second half of 2025 into the first quarter of 2026. The timing shift for the U.K. shipments is due to the government's use of their fiscal year minimum purchase -- product purchase for the spring campaign in 2026. So our deliveries will now deliver in 1Q 2026. This represents the vast majority of the $300 million impact. Importantly, the timing shift does not impact the total value of our long-term multiyear contract with the U.K. government.\nOur updated revenue range continues to reflect the uncertainties in vaccination rates the competitive market environment, the size of the RSV market and timing of licensure of our factories and product approvals in Australia and Canada. On a geographic basis, we are updating U.S. product sales -- we are expecting U.S. product sales of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, international product sales of $0.4 billion to $0.6 billion and other revenues of approximately $100 million, where the majority is international. For U.S. product sales of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, the high end of the range assumes flat year-over-year performance after adjusting for last year's $200 million prior period return reserve reversal.\nThe low end of the range factors the potential combined impacts from lower vaccination rates and competitive market pressures. For international product sales of $0.4 billion to $0.6 billion, the low end of the range is mainly from secured contracts, while the high end factors in incremental revenue from active tenders. The range now also reflects the shift in shipments for the U.K. from the second half of 2025 to the first quarter of 2026. For other revenues of $100 million, we've already recognized $50 million in the first half of the year and expect a similar amount in the second half. The majority of the revenue is associated with our new manufacturing sites but also includes some grant, collaboration, licensing and royalty revenue.\nThe split of our 3Q and 4Q revenue mix will be dependent on timing of regulatory approvals across the world, and the number of days available to ship in the third quarter. We expect the revenue split of 40% to 50% in Q3 with the balance in Q4. Our cost of sales estimate of $1.2 billion remains unchanged and reflects year-over-year improvements in manufacturing efficiency, offset by increased costs associated with the go-live of our new international manufacturing sites. Newly introduced tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on our cost of sales. We continue to monitor changes to global tariffs.\nWe are lowering our R&D expense forecast from $4.1 billion to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion due to Phase III trial wind-downs, continued portfolio prioritization and productivity. Our revised R&D guidance projects an increase in the second half versus the first half, driven by the seasonality of vaccine spend as well as studies in support of regulatory approvals. SG&A expenses are still expected to be $1.1 billion.\nSimilar to last year, we expect higher SG&A expenses in the second half of the year, primarily due to commercial-related activity but also due to severance charges associated with the workforce reduction we announced yesterday. We expect taxes to be negligible in 2025 and our capital expenditures projection has been lowered from $400 million down to $300 million due to our continued prioritization and efficiency gains. We still expect to end 2025 with approximately $6 billion in cash and investments.\nMoving to Slide 9. As discussed on last quarter's call, we are planning a total reduction in annual GAAP operating expenses of over $6 billion from $11 billion in 2023 to $5 billion or less in 2027. On a cash cost basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, -- we are decreasing annual operating expenses from $8.9 billion in 2023 to our midpoint target of $4.2 billion in 2027, which is a reduction of over 50%. Our revised 2025 GAAP operating expense range is now $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, a $400 million reduction at the midpoint from our previous guidance of $6.4 billion.\nThis updated guidance puts us on track to achieve the first $5 billion of our overall $6 billion reduction in annual GAAP expenses in 2 years. Our updated 2025 guidance includes $0.9 billion of noncash expenses from stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Excluding those noncash items, we now project a 2025 cash cost of approximately $5.1 billion. At the midpoint of the range, a $400 million reduction from our previous cash cost estimate of $5.5 billion. The strong progress in cost reductions to date has been a company-wide effort. While we continue to drive additional cost reductions in all areas, the largest source of future reductions will come from R&D, which represents over 60% of our cost base.\nOn the next slide, I want to share our strategy to achieve our 2027 operating expense targets in more detail. On Slide 10, you can see our GAAP and cash cost targets for 2025 versus 2027. At the midpoint of our ranges, we are targeting a $1.1 billion GAAP cost reduction from $6 billion in 25 million to $4.9 billion in 2017 and a $900 million cash cost reduction from $5.1 billion in $25 billion to $4.2 billion in 2017. There are 4 primary drivers to achieve this goal, which are all relatively evenly split in impact.\nFirst, a reduction in R&D expenses from the completion of our large Phase III trials. We are already seeing the impact of the completion of most of our respiratory trials in 2025, and we'll start to see future cost savings by 2027 from the completion of our Phase III trials for CMB and norovirus. This includes both direct trial costs as well as reductions in clinical manufacturing and other related overheads. These cost reductions will be partially offset by select investments in the pipeline such as our oncology portfolio. Second, we will continue to drive manufacturing efficiencies, which will impact both cost of sales and R&D.\nWe have already made strong progress over the past few years to optimize our manufacturing footprint from endemic level demand of our COVID vaccine. We expect to drive additional savings through process improvements as well as reductions in future inventory write-downs. For example, in 2024, we had $0.5 billion of inventory write-downs, which we are actively driving to reduce in 2025 and beyond. Third, we continue to drive procurement savings. Some of the savings from the renegotiated contracts already taken place will not be fully realized until 2026. Additionally, we have a strong pipeline of new savings initiatives.\nFourth, we announced a workforce restructuring yesterday that impacts approximately 10% of our employees and will lower our employee base to under 5,000 by the end of the year versus 5,800 at the beginning of the year. account reductions are always difficult decisions as they impact valued colleagues have contributed meaningfully to our mission. However, these actions are necessary to reshape our capabilities and align to our long-term operating cost structure.\nIn summary, in just 2 years, the team has made tremendous progress towards our 4-year roughly $5 billion cash cost reduction plan. By the end of 2025, we have taken nearly $4 billion of cost out of the business and have an achievable plan to remove another $1 billion over the next 2 years. We remain committed to breaking even on a cash cost basis in 2028 and and will adjust spending as necessary. With that, I will now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review progress across our pipeline. Slide 12 is a review of our prioritized pipeline. As Stephan stated earlier, we have announced significant updates for many of these programs, including the recent approval for mNEXSPIKE, an expanded label for resi and approval of our pediatric Spikevax COVID vaccine, which was previously available in the United States under an emergency use authorization. In the quarter, we also reported strong vaccine efficacy results from our Phase III seasonal flu trial, and we continue to make progress in the rest of the prioritized portfolio, where we are targeting a total of additional potential filings through 2028.\nMoving to Slide 13, which outlines the latest developments of our late-stage respiratory portfolio. I'll start with our COVID vaccine, Spikevax and the mNEXSPIKE. As mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the FDA's approval of the mNEXSPIKE our next-generation COVID vaccine, which has shown strong relative vaccine efficacy compared to mNEXSPIKE in its Phase III trial. -- including in the 65 and older age subgroup and in those with risk factors for severe COVID-19. mNEXSPIKE was approved in the U.S. for individuals 65 and older and for people, 12 to 64 with at least 1 risk factor. An extensive analysis of the Phase III clinical data for mNEXSPIKE was published last month in Balance and the link to the publication can be found on this slide.\nWe submitted the annual updates for our COVID-19 vaccines for the currently recommended Lp.8.1 strain in the quarter and expect mNEXSPIKE and Spikevax will be available this fall in the United States. Speaking of Spikevax, the vaccine was recently approved by the FDA for high-risk children ages 6 months to 11 years. Spikevax had previously been available to this age group in the U.S. only under an emergency use authorization. Earlier this week, Spikevax also received EMA approval for the current season update lp.8.1.1, strain update for the coming season. For RSV, RM RESI vaccine was approved by the FDA on June 12 for individuals ages 18 to 59 with at least 1 risk factor.\nThe CDC subsequently adopted the ACIP recommendation for the 50- to 59-year old age cohort in this group, which means that recommendations for our vaccine are now consistent with competitors. For our seasonal flu vaccine, we announced positive results from our Phase III efficacy study. We are very pleased with the results, which I'll talk through on the next slide. We expect these flu results will also support our discussions with regulators about our flu plus COVID combination vaccine, and we have begun consultations with regulators on the submission requirements for both vaccines.\nOn Slide 14, I will discuss the very encouraging P304 flu vaccine efficacy data released during the quarter. In this 40,000-person study conducted across 11 countries, our seasonal flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, demonstrated relative vaccine efficacy that was 26.6% higher than the licensed standard dose comparator in adults aged 50 and above. Safety and tolerability of mRNA-1010 were consistent with previously reported Phase III results, and the majority of solicited adverse reactions were mild. Importantly, strong relative vaccine efficacy was observed for all 3 influenza strains contained in the vaccine, including each 1 in 1, H3N2 and the B Victoria's tree. Likewise, the relative vaccine efficacy was consistently strong across age groups, risk factors and previous vaccination status. In the important 65 and older demographic relative vaccine efficacy was a strong 27.4%.\nWe look forward to presenting these data at an upcoming medical conference, and we are preparing to file for FDA approval for this vaccine. Now turning to our nonrespiratory vaccine and rare disease portfolios. In our Phase III CMV efficacy study for mRNA-1647, we have now accrued sufficient primary endpoint cases for the final analysis. The analysis has not yet been conducted and the company remains fully blinded at this time. We've submitted an amendment to the analysis plan to add important powered secondary endpoints that we hope will increase the scientific value of the results. Once the updated analysis plan is formalized, we will proceed with the analysis of primary and secondary endpoints, which we expect to complete in the fall.\nOur Phase III norovirus study is now accruing cases in its first season, -- as with other studies, the interim analysis of efficacy is dependent on case accrual. And depending upon the rate case accrual, the study has been designed so that it may proceed to a second season of enrollment if necessary. In rare diseases, our propionic acidemia or PA program is currently in a registrational study, and we believe we are on track for a potential 2027 approval. For methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, we plan to initiate the registrational trial this year.\nWe continue to advance our oncology portfolio, with significant progress across our individualized neoantigen therapy, known as Intismeran, mRNA-4359 previously called checkpoint and our early-stage oncology pipeline. In collaboration with Merck, we have several late-stage studies underway for Intismeran. As a reminder, the Phase III trial in adjuvant melanoma is fully enrolled and accruing cases towards its interim analysis. Our Phase II adjuvant renal cell carcinoma trial is fully enrolled as well.\nAnd as we have disclosed previously, we have 2 Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer 1 Phase II study in high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer and 1 Phase II study in high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We have also expanded our Intismeran program into a Phase II study in first-line metastatic melanoma. This could be the first of many studies using Intismeran and KEYTRUDA together in metastatic indications. Following on from Intismeran, mRNA-4359 is now in a Phase II study in first-line metastatic melanoma and first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. -- and we are currently enrolling patients in the lung cancer portion of that study.\nWe are pleased that the data from the Phase Ib study of mRNA-4359 plus KEYTRUDA in checkpoint inhibitor refractory PD-L1 positive patients was accepted as a mini oral presentation at ESMO. We look forward to presenting these findings at the meeting in October. In early-stage oncology, we are also dosing patients in our Phase I tumor-targeted antigen therapy, mRNA-4106. -- and -- and the INDs for our cell therapy enhancing engine therapy, mRNA-4203 and our T cell engager, mRNA-2808 are also now both open. We are pleased by our growing oncology pipeline and the continued strong momentum of the large entysmarin clinical trial program in partnership with Merck. With that, I'll hand over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stephen and Jamie. As you know, we have 3 priorities: Part 1 drive sales of approved products, Priority 2, focus on a lessee pipeline where we can drive product growth for approvals and priority free delivering on our cost efficiency across the company. Our first priorities will drive use of Spikevax and resi vaccines. We entered the third quarter of 2025 with 3 approved products in the U.S., and we are seeing a growing number of approvals in countries worldwide. For Paris, we are focused on delivering up to 10 products approval, which we believe will drive sales growth for the company. Together, these 10 anticipated products target an addressable market that is over $30 billion. .\nIn Q2, we secured U.S. approvals for and for Highways people, and which are exciting data in flu, enabling frugandfucoit combo. On the cost side of the house, -- we've demonstrated our commitment to cost discipline to the reduction achieved in last year in 2024 and also in 2025 to date. We remain confident in our ability to further streamline our operational structure for the remaining of '25 to 2027. CME just took you through our plans to cut an additional $400 million of our 2025 cost structure, and we are not done.\nWe have many new projects in the works to reduce cost further. These cost reduction activities we have in place gives us even greater confidence in our plan to reduce our cash cost to $4.2 billion in 2027. These actions are very important to help us achieve our cash breakeven targets in 2028. As we make these cost improvements, we are seeing continued use of AI across Moderna. We rolled out GPT Enterprise in 2024 and established widespread GPT literacy across the entire organization. Today, 100% of our knowledge workers are active daily users of Chat GPT.\nAs you can see on Slide 22, GPT users have grown very fast at the company. And in 2025, we enhanced II tools to allow for deep research capabilities allowing for the creation of comprehensive report without compromised quality of output. An example of a deep research application is the creation of target product profiles. This AI-based activity greatly reduces the amount of time it takes on product planners to create marketing strategies. We're excited about how AI has already improved our business.\nAnd given the doubling of AI capabilities every 6 to 7 months, we are working hard to continue to reinvent our company across issues process department and team. We're excited about the coming months and quarters as we have a lot of important catalysts. First, of course, the potential approvals of seasonal trough and the Fuska programs based on the data Stephen shared with you. We're also eager to get the CMV Phase III efficacy data later this year. Norovirus Phase III readout is, of course, subject to gas accruals.\nIn oncology, we look forward to the readout of our ongoing interim Phase II 5-year durability data in adjuvant melanoma. And of course, -- we look forward to a Phase III adjuvant melanoma trial readout for . As Stephen said in oncology, we are looking forward to sharing the checkpoint Phase Ib data at desmin Berlin in October. And as a today, we look forward to sharing the Phase II data of this program.\nPierre is already in restriction study and MMA will be very soon. I'm pleased with the progress we have made on all 3 of our priorities over the course of the first 6 months of the year. We now have 3 products approved by the U.S. FDA. We are highly encouraged about the progress in the pipeline and very pleased by . In our financial discipline, we have accelerated our plan for cost efficiency and expect to deliver an additional $400 million of cost savings this year. I want to thank the team for all the great work that was done this quarter. We are very focused on executing those priorities going forward. This work allows to be focused on our mission. To deliver the greatest possible impact to people for mRNA medicine. With this, operator, we'll be happy to take questions.",

Welcome to the Moderna First Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's First Quarter 2025 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we will be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website. On today's call are Stephane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a review of our business in Q1. Jimmy will present our financial results and our outlook. Stephen will review our clinical programs and I will come back to some key priorities and catalysts before we take your questions.\nLet me start with a review of our financials. Our Q1 revenues were $0.1 billion, had a loss of $1 billion. These were in line with our expectations and reflect the highly seasonal nature of our respiratory vaccine business. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion in cash and investments. As you are aware, we are focused on financial discipline. I'm pleased to announce that continued cost reduction efforts in the first quarter of 2025 led to a 19% reduction of cost of sales, R&D [indiscernible] combined compared to the first quarter of 2024. I would like to thank our team for a great work.\nDuring the quarter, we made solid progress against our 3 priorities: priority number one, expanded markets for commercial products. Earlier this year, we were awarded a tender opportunity, allowing us to complete for COVID vaccine business in Europe. Additionally, during the quarter, mRESVIA received approvals in Australia, in Taiwan and in the U.K. and most recently, in Switzerland. This is in addition to a program we received in 2024 in the U.S., EU and Canada.\nOur second priority has a single pipeline to drive sales growth and diversification. I am excited to announce the expansion of our oncology portfolio with Checkpoint medicine, which Stephan will review later. For Phase III [ flu ] program, we have exceeded the required number of case accruals to run an interim vaccine efficacy analysis. We also projected encouraging data from our key programs, including RSV, CMV and IAC at reset medical conferences. We are pleased to share that IC will now be known by the high end of international nonproprietary name of intismeran autogene. This is in addition reflects the growing maturity of our product development program and make an important milestone as we continue adapting towards potential regulatory approvals.\nAnd finally, on our third priority, executing with financial discipline. The first quarter of 2025 marks the third consecutive quarter we will reduce combined R&D SG&A expenses by double digits year-over-year.\nWith that, let me turn to Jamey.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Stephan, and welcome, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter financial results, our full year outlook and an updated operating cost framework as we look ahead to 2026 and 2027. Let's start with our first quarter financial results shown on Slide 7. Net product sales were $86 million, driven primarily by COVID vaccine sales. The U.S. accounted for about 1/3 of total sales with the remainder from international markets. This result was in line with expectations given the seasonal nature of respiratory vaccines with most sales anticipated in the second half of the year.\nWe observed lower vaccination rates compared to Q1 last year, reflecting the continued transition of COVID into routine seasonal vaccination patterns. In addition to product sales, we recorded $22 million of other revenue, bringing total revenue for the quarter to $108 million, a decrease of 35% year-over-year, but in line with expectations. Cost of sales for the quarter was $90 million compared to the first quarter of 2024, cost of sales decreased $6 million, primarily due to lower sales volume.\nWhile total sales declined year-over-year, it represented 104% of net product sales this quarter, up from 58% in the prior year, driven by lower volume and revenue mix. R&D expenses were $856 million, a 19% decrease year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by lower clinical development spend across our respiratory programs reflecting the timing of trial activity and the wind down of certain studies. This was partially offset by continued investment in our norovirus program and oncology. SG&A expenses were $212 million, down 23% year-over-year. The decrease was driven by broad-based cost reductions. These reductions reflect our continued focus on streamlining operations and managing costs across the organization.\nWe recognized an income tax provision of $7 million in the first quarter. Similar to the prior year, the provision was not material due to the continued valuation allowance on our global deferred tax assets. which limits our ability to recognize tax benefits from the loss. Net loss for the quarter was $1 billion, a $204 million improvement compared to a $1.2 billion loss in the first quarter of 2024. Loss per share was $2.52, an improvement from a loss of $3.07 in the prior year period.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $8.4 billion. compared to $9.5 billion at the end of Q4. The decrease was primarily driven by the operating loss for the quarter.\nNow let's turn to our financial framework for 2025 on Slide 8. Our expectations for the full year 2025 remain unchanged from our initial guidance in February. We still expect total revenue in 2025 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion with first half sales of approximately $0.2 billion, reflecting the seasonality of our respiratory vaccine business. As a reminder, the wide range of our guidance reflects the uncertainties in vaccination rates, the competitive market environment, the size of the RSV market and timing of licensure of our factories and product approvals in Australia, Canada and the U.K.\nAs previously shared, while we filed 3 products with the FDA in 2024, since we don't know the timing of potential approvals, we are not including any new product revenue in our guidance range. Cost of sales is projected to be approximately $1.2 billion, reflecting continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency, and lower expected inventory write-offs, offset by increased costs associated with the go-live of our new manufacturing sites in Australia, Canada and the U.K.\nI'll now provide some perspective on the newly introduced global tariffs, those in action as of today have not had a significant direct impact on Moderna. All of our drug substance for the U.S. market is manufactured at our facilities in Massachusetts. Our commercial drug substance has been shipped overseas for fill/finish operations before shipment to the final customers.\nInternationally, our new plants in Australia, Canada and the U.K. are expected to be outlined in 2025 to supply local markets. Finally, material sourced from China are not material to our total cost base. R&D expenses are anticipated to be approximately $4.1 billion as we continue to invest in our late-stage pipeline while maintaining financial discipline. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting a continued focus on efficiency while supporting our commercial execution.\nWhile we are pleased with the cost reductions that we achieved in both R&D and SG&A during the first quarter of 2025, it is still early in the year, and we are not updating our full year expense guidance at this time. That being said, it is a strong start to the year, and we are looking to accelerate additional cost reductions in 2025. We expect taxes to be negligible in 2025, and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $400 million. And we still expect to end 2025 with approximately $6 billion in cash and investments.\nBeyond 2025, we are announcing today our plan to drive an additional $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion of cost reductions by 2027. As part of our commitment to achieve our 2028 breakeven target on a cash cost basis. To that end, we are reducing our 2026 GAAP operating expense forecast from $5.9 billion to a range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. This guidance includes $0.9 billion of noncash charges from stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.\nExcluding these items, we now project a 2026 cash cost of approximately $4.7 billion at the midpoint of the range. We are also planning to reduce 2027 GAAP expenses to between $4.7 billion and $5 billion. with a 2027 cash cost of approximately $4.2 billion at the midpoint of the range, excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization.\nStepping back from 2023 to 2027, we are planning a total reduction in annual GAAP expenses of over $6 billion, which represents a 55% reduction over 4 years from $11 billion annually in 2023 to $5 billion or less in 2027. The first $4 billion of GAAP expense reductions were realized in 2024 with the largest driver coming from reductions in our cost of sales, when we undertook a strategic initiative in the second half of 2023, to restructure our manufacturing footprint to better optimize pandemic level demand of our cobid vaccine. We also reduced SG&A by 24% from 2023 to 2024 through a variety of cost-out initiatives throughout the company, and R&D declined 6% year-over-year to $4.5 billion in 2024.\nWhile we are continuing to drive additional cost reductions and efficiency gains in both cost of sales and SG&A, the largest future source of cost reductions will come from R&D. which currently represents nearly 2/3 of our expense base. This projected decline in R&D expense will come from the completion and wind down of our ongoing Phase III trials. procurement savings from contract renegotiations and other process efficiencies.\nIn summary, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in our cost-out initiatives to date. As Stephan mentioned, we now have had 3 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year declines in combined R&D and SG&A expenses. Our teams continue to identify and act on new savings opportunities, which gives us the confidence in meeting our new 2026 and 2027 cost targets.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Jamey. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review progress across our pipeline. Slide 11 is a review of our prioritized pipeline, which is introduced at our R&D Day last September. As you know, we have since filed for regulatory approvals for 3 of these programs. our next-generation COVID vaccine in mRNA-1283, our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59 mRNA-1345 and our Flu plus COVID combination vaccine for individuals aged 50 and over are mRNA-1083. As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization, we've made a strategic decision to deprioritize the flu covid combination vaccine for younger adults, those aged 18 to 49.\nWhile we remain committed to the long-term potential of combination respiratory vaccines, we are going to be focusing our efforts on combination vaccines in the older adult population for now. At the same time, we are excited to announce the advancement of our oncology pipeline with the addition of the Checkpoint program. The prioritization of this Phase II program is based on our early but encouraging data and is consistent with our strategy to build our therapeutics pipeline, particularly in oncology. We are targeting filings for Checkpoint and the other 6 programs on the right-hand side of this slide by 2028, subject to notes to data and regulatory consultations.\nMoving to Slide 13, which outlines the latest development in our late-stage respiratory portfolio. As I just mentioned, we submitted regulatory filings late last year for 3 programs. Our next-gen COVID vaccine has a PDUFA date of May 31. The age group expansion for our RSV vaccine has a PDUFA date of June 12, and we look forward to decisions on both products in the coming months. For our flu COVID combination vaccine, we received a November 2025 PDUFA date. However, following feedback from the FDA during the review, the flu vaccine efficacy data will now be needed to support the application.\nAs a result, we now expect to review timeline to be extended into 2026 and be dependent upon positive Phase III efficacy results from our ongoing food vaccine trial. and the addition of these data to the submission. And on that point, our stand-alone flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, is in its Phase III efficacy study. And due to the intensity of the current flu season, has now exceeded the required number of cases to support the interim efficacy analysis, which we expect to complete now by this summer.\nNow turning to our nonrespiratory vaccine and rare disease portfolio. Our for our CMV vaccine, we recently presented durability data from our Phase II study at the SMID Conference, demonstrating that mRNA-1647 continues to elicit robust antibody responses for 3 years post vaccination, showing very strong durability. We also had the opportunity to share these findings along with an overview of our CMV program at the inaugural CMV vaccines Work Group as a part of the April ACIP meetings. We're encouraged by the establishment of this work group, which reflects the growing recognition of CMV as a significant public health concern and a commitment to reducing the disease burden of CMV.\nOur Phase III CMV efficacy study for mRNA-1647 continues to recruit cases. We remain blinded to the study results at this time and expect the final efficacy analysis to come later this year. For norovirus, we are pleased to note that the FDA clinical hold for our Phase III trial was lifted during the quarter. The study is fully enrolled in the Northern Hemisphere, and we are continuing to enroll in the Southern Hemisphere. Phase III FC readout for norovirus is dependent upon case accruals. And given the uncertainty of that timing, the targeted approval could be in 2026 or 2027, depending upon that readout. We expect to have more clarity on the pace of case accrual and potential readout timing later this year.\nIn rare diseases, our probiotic acidemia, or PA program is currently in a registrational study. We've made good progress with regulators and with enrollment. Following review of program timeline and other aspects of the launch, we now anticipate a 2027 approval. Similarly, for methylmalonic acidemia or MMA, we've finalized the registrational study design with the FDA, and we plan to initiate that trial in 2025. We expect the potential for approval for M&A in 2028.\nWe continue to advance our oncology portfolio with significant progress across our individualized neoantigen therapy program intismarin, our Checkpoint program and our early-stage oncology programs. In collaboration with Merck, we have several late-stage studies underway for intismera. As a reminder, the Phase III trial in adjuvant melanoma is now fully enrolled. We also have 2 Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer, both evaluating intismaran in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with and without prior new adjuvant treatment.\nAdditionally, we're conducting randomized Phase II trials in adjuvant high-risk muscle invasive bladder cancer and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma. I'm happy to announce that the Phase II adjuvant renal cell carcinoma study is now also fully enrolled. We're also expanding the scope of our intesmarin program into earlier stages of disease, with the addition of a new Phase II study that moves beyond the adjuvant setting. This study evaluates intismarin as monotherapy or in combination with BCG, the standard of care in high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and will help us explore intismarin's potential in earlier disease settings beyond the adjuvant landscape.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we have prioritized advancement of our Checkpoint program based on encouraging early clinical results. The program is currently being evaluated in a Phase II study for both first-line metastatic melanoma and first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. I'll review the details of that program on the next slide. We're also advancing 2 novel cancer entogen therapies to the clinic. mRNA-4106 is a tumor-targeted antigen therapy designed to direct the immune system against multiple shared tumor antigen.\nThe first patient has been dosed in a Phase I study in solid tumors that is assessing safety, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy for the program. And we have an open IND for mRNA-4203, which is designed to boost the activity of an engineered T cell therapy to improve its persistence and effectiveness. This program is being developed in collaboration with Dematic. These cancer entogen therapies, checkpoint mRNA-4106 and mRNA-4203 are off-the-shelf therapies in contract with intesmarin, which is an individualized cancer treatment. These programs reflect our growing oncology pipeline with more coming soon.\nNow let me provide an overview of the Checkpoint program, mRNA-4359, starting with its mechanism of action. Checkpoint is designed to help a patient's immune system recognize and attack tumor cells by encoding mRNA-based cancer antigens for PD-L1 and IDO. The therapy train the immune system to recognize upregulation of PD-L1 and IDO by cancer cells and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. By combining this targeted immune activation therapy with checkpoint inhibition with traditional antibodies such as KEYTRUDA, we aim to enhance the antitumor response. overcoming in innovation and improving the depth and durability of responses.\nCheckpoint is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical study, which is now moving and moving forward and enrolling the Phase II portion. This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of checkpoint, both as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and first-line metastatic melanoma. Key efficacy endpoints will include objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and progression-free survival. It is an open-label study.\nIn addition to clinical outcomes, we are evaluating T cell profile changes, both in the peripheral blood and within the tumor microenvironment to better understand mRNA-4359 mechanism of action. We shared early Phase Ia data at the ESMO Medical Congress in late 2024, and we're excited and looking forward to sharing the data from the Phase Ib portion of the study at a medical conference later this year. Based on the early encouraging results, we plan to expand checkpoint into multiple additional cancer indications.\nWith that review, I will now hand it over to Stephan.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stephen and Jamey. We are focused on 3 priorities: priority 1, to drive sales of approved products. Priority 2 to focus on our late-stage pipeline to drive sales growth and diversification. Priority 3, to deliver cost efficiency across the entire business. Our first priority is to drive the Spivak and [ MS ] vaccines. We entered 2025 with 2 approved products which puts us in a better competitive position compared to the beginning of 2024. With our ability to now offer RSV for a full season, we expect to better compete in the respiratory vaccine market. In a recent international media approval should add to sales this year.\nPriority 2. We are focused on delivering up to 10 product programs, which we believe will drive sales growth. Together, this [indiscernible] an anticipated product target a total adverse market of over $30 billion. As Ivan discussed earlier, we have taken some of our priority programs. For the combination of [indiscernible] in age 50 and older, we expect the additional Sannomificacy data coming soon for compiling will extend the review and approval timeline to 2026.\nFor Norovirus, the grant timing is dependent on cash accrual, which will mean the potential 2026 or 2027 approval. We are very pleased with the addition of Checkpoint AMC to our new prototype pipeline, mRNA-4359. And finally, for [indiscernible] we had seat approvals in 2027 and 2028, respectively. Priority 3, drive cost efficiency across the entire business. We've demonstrated our commitment to cost discipline through reduction achieved in 2024 and 2025 to date.\nWe remain confident in our ability to further streamline our operating structure for the remaining of 2025 through 2027. We are pleased to announce today the 2027 cash cost target of $4.2 billion giving us additional confidence in achieving our cash breakeven target in [ 2025 ] For [ Tapout ] program, we expect important milestones. We filed for approval for 3 products in 2024 or [ Neinor ] 13 or as vaccine for high-risk 18 to 59-year-olds. We look forward to regulatory vision on this. For [ Fusco ] combination vaccine, we expect an extended review timeline pending positive stand-alone through efficacy data and submission with averting a 26 approval.\nFor CMV, we look forward to having the final results of our Phase III vaccine efficacy study in 2025. We have exceeded the cash accrual goals for flu efficacy study and expected without by this summer. On norovirus vaccine is in Phase III and the timing of our data will be subject to case accrual. In oncology, the return of our ongoing in this intismaran PhaseIII advisement trial will be subject to Everol. -- and we expect to present our Phase II 5-year durability data in adjuvant melanoma next year.\nAs mentioned before, we are very excited by the addition of the Checkpoint productized portfolio, and we look forward to sharing that now at a medical meeting later this year. For PA, we are already generating data for restructuring study, and we expect to start a restructuring study for MMA this year. I am very thankful to our team for our progress achieved so far across the commercial organization, our late stage pipeline and a great cost reduction efforts across the company. With this, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to the Moderna Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss Moderna's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results and Business Updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer; Jamey Mock, Chief Financial Officer; and Stephen Hoge, President.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nI will now turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will start with a review of 2024. Jamey will present our financial results and outlook. Stephen will review our clinical programs. I will then come back and show our key priorities for 2025 before we take your questions.\nIn 2024, we recorded revenue of $3.2 billion. The team has looked how to generate cost savings of $2.6 billion or 27% down from 2023. We reported a loss of $3.6 billion.\nWhile we have anticipated to end the year with $9 billion in cash, thanks to the team's work on OpEx, CapEx and also working capital, we ended the year with $9.5 billion of cash and investments at year-end.\nIn September 2024, we announced our focus on 10 high-value programs for which we expect financial approvals over the next 3 years, driving sales growth and diversification from our top line from COVID. This program includes the respiratory vaccine, next-gen COVID, combination of flu plus COVID, RSV 18 to 59 at 5-week [indiscernible], flu. In late [indiscernible], CMV and Norovirus. In rare disease, PA and MMA. And oncology, INT for adjuvant melanoma. In addition to pulling sales growth, the prioritization of these programs will allow us to reduce our R&D expenses in this time frame.\nFrom a pipeline standpoint, it was a year of strong progress. In 2024, we became a multiproduct company who we have power of [indiscernible]. Along with buybacks, we now have 2 commercial products on the market.\nWe reported positive Phase III results in 4 of our [indiscernible] program, and we filed for FDA approval on next-gen COVID, our combination of flu plus COVID and the RSV vaccine for RSV 18 to 59. And [indiscernible] vaccine is currently in a Phase III efficacy trial.\nWe also reported additional progress across our programs for the Phase I/II from vaccine against Norovirus, EBV and BBB.\nIn oncology, we presented data at major medical meetings in 2024. For INT program, in June, we reported positive [indiscernible] data in adjuvant melanoma for the Phase II trial. In addition, for checkpoint program vaccine, mRNA-4359, we presented positive Phase I data in September.\nIn [ rare disease ], we had positive early safety and clinical data from PA and MMA.\nWith that, I will hand over to Jamey.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Stéphane, and hello, everyone. Today, I will walk through our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, providing insights into the key drivers behind our performance. I'll also outline our 2025 financial framework as we continue to optimize our operations and position the company for long-term success.\nLet's begin by reviewing our commercial performance on Slide 8. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net product sales were $0.9 billion, with $0.2 billion in the United States and $0.7 billion outside the United States.\nFor the full year, net product sales were $3.1 billion, at the lower end of our revised guidance. U.S. sales were $1.7 billion for the year, benefiting from a $0.2 million favorable adjustment related to a prior period return reserve reversal. Excluding this adjustment, sales volume saw a decline compared to last year, primarily due to lower vaccination rates, lower market share and increased competition. However, we observed signs of stabilization and believe the COVID market will remain durable over time.\nOutside the U.S., product sales were $1.4 billion, aligning with the midpoint of our guidance. This includes approximately $400 million from advanced purchase agreements that will not recur in 2025. The vast majority of our sales were from Spikevax.\nWhile we launched our second product, mRESVIA, in the third quarter, sales were only $25 million for the full year. While early RSV sales were limited, we see long-term opportunity to expand our presence in this market, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nMoving on to Slide 9. I will now walk through our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $966 million, down 66% from the same period last year. As expected, sales were impacted by the earlier launch of our updated COVID vaccine in the U.S., with FDA approval granted 3 weeks earlier than the prior year. This allowed us to meet demand sooner, shifting a portion of sales into the third quarter. International sales were also lower year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing phaseout of advanced purchase agreements.\nCost of sales for the quarter was $739 million, including $45 million in third-party royalties, $193 million in inventory write-downs and a noncash charge of $238 million from the termination of a contract manufacturing agreement. The contract termination is part of our continued effort to optimize our manufacturing footprint, following the strategic resizing initiative launched in 2023 to align with the transition to a seasonal endemic market.\nWhile cost of sales declined by $190 million compared to the prior year, lower product sales volume drove cost of sales to 79% of product sales. Excluding the resizing charge, this would have been 53%.\nR&D expenses in Q4 were $1.1 billion, reflecting a 20% year-over-year decline. The decrease was primarily driven by lower clinical development and manufacturing costs across our COVID, RSV, flu and combination vaccine programs. This was partially offset by increased investments in our Norovirus and INT programs. Additionally, last year's R&D expenses included $120 million upfront payment related to our collaboration with [ Thematics ], which did not recur this year.\nSG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $351 million, down 25% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in purchased services and external consultants as we continue to focus on cost management and operational efficiencies.\nWe recognized an income tax benefit of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to the prior year, the benefit was not material, due to the global valuation allowance maintained against most of our deferred tax assets.\nNet loss for the quarter was $1.1 billion compared to net income of $217 million in Q4 2023. Loss per share was $2.91 compared to earnings per share of $0.55 in the prior period.\nWe ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $9.5 billion, up from $9.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to accounts receivable collections.\nNow let's turn to our full year 2024 financial results on Slide 10. Total revenue for the year was $3.2 billion, a 53% decline from 2023, primarily driven by lower product sales, which I discussed on the prior page. Other revenue contributed $127 million for the year, reflecting grant revenue, collaboration, licensing and royalty revenue.\nCost of sales for the full year 2024 was $1.5 billion or 47% of net product sales. Excluding the $0.2 billion noncash resizing charge, this would have been 39% and below our previous guidance of 40% to 45%. This represents a $3.2 billion decrease from 2023 due to lower manufacturing resizing charges as well as lower inventory write-downs and reduced unutilized manufacturing capacity costs, all of which reflect improved efficiency.\nR&D expenses for the year were $4.5 billion, down 6% from 2023. The decrease was largely due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing costs as well as fewer upfront payments for collaboration agreements. We did, however, purchase 2 priority review vouchers during the year, which offset some of those savings.\nFor the full year, SG&A expenses totaled $1.2 billion, a 24% decrease compared to 2023. The decrease reflects disciplined cost management across the organization. We have continued to build capabilities and build -- bring more functions in-house, allowing us to reduce reliance on external consultants while improving operational efficiency. Additionally, these savings were exported by better leveraging digital technology and artificial intelligence to streamline operations.\nWe reported an income tax benefit of $46 million for the full year compared to an income tax expense of $772 million in 2023. The shift is mainly due to the global valuation allowance we established last year on most of our deferred tax assets, which continues to impact our tax position.\nNet loss for the year was $3.6 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, with a loss per share of $9.28 compared to $12.33 in the prior period.\nMoving to Slide 11. We want to highlight the significant reduction in our operating expenses in 2024. On a GAAP basis, cost declined $3.9 billion, from $11.1 billion to $7.2 billion. Excluding resizing charges of $1.6 billion and $0.2 billion for 2023 and 2024, respectively, we reduced operating expenses by $2.6 billion compared to 2023, driven by manufacturing footprint resizing, pricing renegotiations, R&D prioritization, volume reductions and a greater use of digital tools to improve efficiency. Additionally, both 2023 and 2024 operating expenses included noncash costs of $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.\nIf we would exclude the manufacturing footprint resizing charges, stock-based compensation and depreciation, our defined cash costs were $8.9 billion in 2023 and $6.3 billion in 2024, representing a year-over-year decline of $2.6 billion. To avoid double counting, please note that in 2023, there was approximately $300 million of depreciation and amortization included in the $1.6 billion of resizing charges.\nWe are committed to drive additional cost efficiencies in 2025 and beyond by prioritizing investments to support the 10 product launches over the next 3 years. Our 2025 GAAP expenses are projected at $6.4 billion in 2025, which includes $0.9 billion of noncash charges from stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Excluding those items, we project a cash cost of $5.5 billion. This represents an approximately $1 billion year-over-year reduction from our prior 2024 projection of $6.5 million. We are also planning for an additional $0.5 billion of expense reduction in 2026 as we continue to drive efficiencies across all areas of the business.\nNow let's turn to our financial framework for 2025. We expect total revenue in 2025 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, with first half sales of approximately $0.2 billion, reflecting the seasonality of our respiratory vaccine business.\nAs discussed with investors in January, our wider guidance reflects the uncertainties in vaccination rates, the competitive market environment, the size of the RSV market and timing of licensure of our factories and product approvals in Australia, Canada and the U.K.\nAs a reminder, we filed 3 products to the FDA in 2024, and we are not including any new product revenue in our guidance range. Also, we expect the revenue and R&D expense from our recently announced pandemic influenza program to be relatively immaterial in 2025, and is embedded in our guidance.\nPositive [ sales ] is projected to be approximately $1.2 billion, reflecting continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency and lower expected inventory write-offs offset by increased costs associated with the go-live of our new manufacturing sites in Australia, Canada and the U.K.\nR&D expenses are anticipated to be approximately $4.1 billion as we continue to invest in our late-stage pipeline, while maintaining financial discipline.\nSG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting a continued focus on efficiency while supporting our commercial execution.\nWe expect taxes to be negligible in 2025.\nCapital expenditures are projected to be approximately $0.4 billion. This increase from our prior guidance of $0.3 billion is primarily due to the timing of spend between 2024 and 2025. 2024 actual capital expenditures was approximately $150 million below our prior guidance. Some of that reduction was attributable to prioritization changes, but the majority of the impact was timing of spend between 2024 and 2025. We expect to end 2025 with approximately $6 billion in cash and investments.\nIn summary, 2024 was a year of financial discipline, and we are well positioned as we enter 2025. We remain committed to managing costs, optimizing our operations and investing in our future growth.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Jamey, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone.\nSlide 15 shows the prioritized programs we highlighted at our R&D Day in September. As Stéphane mentioned earlier, we are focused on pursuing these 10 approvals over the next 3 years to drive growth. We've now filed for approval for 3 respiratory vaccines, our next-gen COVID vaccine, our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults ages 18 to 59 and our flu COVID combination vaccine for people aged 50 and older. Most of the other 7 prioritized programs are in pivotal studies, and the remainder are expected to begin their pivotal studies in the near future.\nSlide 16 highlights the most recent updates from our late-stage portfolio. As a reminder, in September, we presented positive efficacy and immunogenicity data from our next-gen COVID vaccine mRNA-1283. We have since filed for approval in multiple jurisdictions, and have a PDUFA date of May 31 in the United States.\nAlso in September, we shared positive Phase III data for our RSV vaccine in high-risk adults ages 18 to 59. This vaccine has also been filed for approval in multiple countries, with a PDUFA date of June 12 in the United States.\nFor our combination flu COVID vaccine, we previously shared positive Phase III immunogenicity and safety data. And on the basis of that data, we filed for approval at the end of last year in the United States and other countries. We have previously demonstrated efficacy for the COVID component of the vaccine, demonstration of efficacy for the flu component may ultimately be required for approval.\nTo that end, our stand-alone flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, is currently in a Phase III efficacy study that is accruing cases rapidly. Based on the current pace of case accrual, we are optimistic that we will be able to conduct the first analysis of efficacy for our flu vaccine at the end of the currency.\nNow turning to our nonrespiratory portfolio. Starting with our latent and other virus vaccines. For our CMV vaccine, we announced last month that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board informed us that the early efficacy criteria was not met, and recommended that the study continue to its final analysis. We remain blinded to the study and continue to expect the results for the final analysis later this year.\nOur Norovirus vaccine Phase III study is fully enrolled in the Northern Hemisphere, and we are preparing to enroll participants for the upcoming Southern Hemisphere season. The trial is currently on FDA clinical hold in the U.S., following a single case of [indiscernible] syndrome, which remains under investigation. Given that enrollment had already completed for this season, we do not currently expect any impact on time lines, while we complete the investigation and update trial documents with this information.\nIn oncology, we and our partner, Merck, have multiple late-stage studies underway evaluating INT or mRNA-4157 in combination with KEYTRUDA. The first of which, adjuvant melanoma, is part of our 10 prioritized program. The Phase III for this is now fully enrolled.\nTwo additional Phase III studies are underway in non-small cell lung cancer, and there are 2 randomized Phase II trials ongoing in high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma.\nIn rare diseases, propionic acidemia, or PA, is in its registrational study, and methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, we have -- with MMA, we have agreed with FDA on our pivotal study design and expect to start that study in 2025.\nWith that, I'll now hand it back to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stephen and Jamey. For 2025, we have 3 priorities. Priority one is to [indiscernible] sales of approved products. Priority two is to focus on our late-stage pipeline, where we believe we have up to 10 product approvals over the next 3 years, which will drive sales growth and diversification. Priority three is to deliver cost efficiency across the business. Let me take you through each of these.\nOur first priority is to review those [indiscernible] backs and [indiscernible] our vaccines. Importantly, we enter 2025 with 2 approved products, which gives us a better competitive positioning that when we enter 2024. We have full [indiscernible] contracting in the U.S. We expect to better compete in the respiratory vaccine market. In addition, upcoming MREL approvals outside the U.S. should also add to sales in 2025.\nPriority two, we are focused on delivering up to 10 products approval over the next 3 years, which we believe will drive sales growth. Together, these 10 expected products target the total addressable market of over $30 billion.\nPriority three, there is a cost efficiency across the business. We've demonstrated our commitment to cost savings by the $2.6 billion cost reduction we made in 2024. We will continue to focus on improving efficiency [indiscernible] costs across the entire company across manufacturing, across [indiscernible] and across SG&A in 2025, but also in 2026.\nFor our efficiency program, we're reducing cash costs to an estimated $5.5 billion in 2025 and $5 billion in 2026. This brings our total cash cost reduction to well over [ $1 billion ] over these 2 years from a $6.3 billion in 2024.\nWe will continue to address our cost structure to ensure we breakeven on a cash cost basis no later than 2028. In the [indiscernible], to be very clear. If needed, we will reduce our cost structure further than the [ $5 billion ] cash cost level if our sales objectives are not met.\nFor [indiscernible] products, we expect important milestones. We filed 3 years of [indiscernible] move forward to having the final reason to our Phase III study in 2025, [indiscernible] vaccine Phase III studies and the timing of data that will be subject to [indiscernible].\n[indiscernible], we will also be subject with [indiscernible].\nFor PA, we're already [indiscernible] data from our retraction study, and we expect to start researching study [indiscernible] this year.\nWe will continue to focus on the [indiscernible] possible impact to people [indiscernible]. Our offering of products and pipeline are promising work, [ 2 ] approved products [indiscernible] and fixed base [indiscernible] for pivotal studies ongoing. So our money platform is working. We've demonstrated progress in our cost reduction program. We have shown that we have a financial discipline to achieve our goals and fulfill our mission.\nWith this, operator, we'll be happy to take questions.",

Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a review of our business. Jamey will present our financial results for the quarter and thank you for our based financial framework. There will then review our clinical progress. I will then close by sharing our commercial progress and our outlook for major upcoming milestones. In the second quarter of 2024, our respiratory franchise has shown remarkable progress and is poised to positively impact millions of lives globally each year. This is why we started Moderna to impact patients, and that is why the Moderna team is so focused on execution because of that profound impact on so many lives. Our mRNA-1273 vaccine, SPIKEVAX, continues to play a critical role in combating COVID. Based on CDC data for the season just ending, October ’23 to June ’24, COVID continues to result in higher hospitalization than other respiratory viruses. We are pleased that the RSV vaccine, which brand name is mRESVIA, of second respiratory product has launched in the U.S. and has now shipped to U.S. customers. It is poised to impact public health in the U.S. this year and soon in many other countries for many years to come.\nOur flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, has demonstrated positive Phase III results, meeting all immunogenicity end points in adults 18 and older. Our flu + COVID combo vaccine candidate, mRNA-1083, has also shown positive results in Phase III, underscoring our ability to innovate and tackle multiple respiratory illnesses effectively. These achievements highlight the strength of our mRNA platform and our commitment to public health. We have now five out of five vaccines with positive Phase III data: COVID, RSV, flu, next-gen COVID, mRNA-1083 and our cold + COVID combo. We are very excited about these achievements and are very thankful for our teams. We believe our technology has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of these respiratory illnesses globally and save millions of hospitalizations around the world and thus impacting millions of families.\nMoving to business highlights for Q2, we manufactured the ’24-’25 season COVID vaccine targeting both the KP2 and GA1 strains of the virus. We are ready to meet the demand for the ’24-’25 respiratory season. In addition to RSV approval in the U.S, we are pleased that mRESVIA received a positive opinion from Europe’s regulatory agency, EMA CHMP. We are waiting for regulatory approvals in additional countries around the world. For pandemic flu, we recently announced a partnership in the U.S. with BARDA to address H5 influenza virus and future public health threats. The agreement awarded Moderna $176 million in funding to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic flu vaccines. Lastly, our Japanese partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation is an important collaboration. With this joint agreement, we will co-promote Moderna respiratory vaccines in Japan, extending our reach and impact in the Japanese market. In Q2, our revenues were up $241 million, which currently reflect the highly seasonal nature of our respiratory vaccine business. The net loss was $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion, maintaining a strong cash and investment position.\nThis progress [inaudible] allows us to continue investing in our key programs and initiatives. Additionally, we continue to make considerable progress in reducing our operating expenses. Compared to Q2 2023, we have decreased our operating expenses by more than $600 million in Q2 2024. This reduction highlights our commitment to operational efficiency and financial discipline. Before I hand over to Jamey, I want to touch on the announcement we made last week. We are very pleased and proud to welcome David Rubinstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of Carlyle Group to the Moderna board, starting next week. David has decades of experience investing and growing businesses across a number of industries. He is also one of the most respected voices globally on matters related to international affairs and public policy. We are very excited to have him join us to help build Moderna to reach to the next level.\nWith David joining the board, Stephen Berenson is stepping down from the board, and I would like to personally thank him for his many contributions during his tenure, including through the pandemic. We also announced that Bob Langer has informed the board of his intention to retire from the board. As one of our co-founders, Bob has made incredible contributions to Moderna and we would not the company we are today without his vision and insights. I am personally very grateful to Bob for his coaching and mentoring, especially during the early years of Moderna, where his start-up experience was so valuable to me. With that, let me turn to Jamey.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks Stéphane, and hello everyone. Today I will walk you through our financial performance for the second quarter and also update you on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2024. Let me start with our commercial performance on Slide 9. Net product sales for Q2 were $184 million, down 37% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales volumes of our COVID-19 vaccine in regions outside of the United States compared to the second quarter of 2023, when we fulfilled orders from prior year contracts. Q2 sales were above our guidance of approximately $100 million, primarily due to stronger than expected sales in the United States. We recognized sales from a number of other countries, including a small portion of the Brazil contract we announced last quarter. Year-to-date sales were $351 million, down 83% year-over-year, largely driven by the same Q2 year-over-year trends I just mentioned a moment ago.\nMoving to Slide 10, as I just explained, net product sales were $184 million. In Q2, we recognized $30 million of licensing revenue which is included in the other revenue line of $57 million. This revenue comes from a non-exclusive intellectual property out-licensing agreement with a leading pharmaceutical company in Japan announced in our Q1 earnings call. The deal includes an upfront payment and low double-digit royalties on net sales of their COVID-19 product in Japan. For the second quarter of 2024, our cost of sales was $115 million, which included $10 million of third party royalties, $55 million related to unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind down costs, and $14 million of inventory write-downs. This resulted in our cost of sales representing 62% of net product sales. As a result of our initiative to resize our manufacturing cost structure, cost of sales was down 84% from Q2 last year when cost of sales was 249%. R&D expenses were $1.2 billion in Q2, reflecting a slight increase of $73 million or 6% year-over-year. We purchased a priority review voucher during the second quarter which is included in our Q2 results. With first half R&D spending at $2.3 billion, we are tracking towards a full year expected spend of approximately $4.5 billion.\nSG&A expenses for Q2 were $268 million, reflecting a 19% decrease year-over-year. This reduction is a result of our continued strong focus on cost discipline and strategic investments driving productivity, on which I will provide additional detail in the upcoming slide. We reported zero income tax expense for the second quarter of 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of $369 million in the same period last year. This shift is primarily due to the continued application of a valuation allowance on a majority of our deferred tax assets, which we first established in the third quarter of 2023. Our net loss for the period was $1.3 billion, an improvement from the net loss of $1.4 billion recorded last year. Loss per share was $3.33 compared to a loss of $3.62 in the second quarter of 2023. We ended Q2 with cash and investments totaling $10.8 billion, down from $12.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily due to ongoing research and development expenses and operating activities. Moving to Slide 11 and similar to Q1, I want to provide additional detail on the cost reductions we are driving across the company.\nYou can see in our Q2 results that we had a 19% year-over-year reduction in SG&A spend due to efficiency gains. One of the main drivers for the year-over-year reduction in SG&A is from our commercial and medical affairs group. Over the past year, we have built our internal capabilities, which has allowed us to drive cost efficiencies by reducing our use of external consultants and other purchased services. We’ve also been more focused and targeted on how we invest in these areas to drive the strongest possible return on investment. As the endemic market has been more seasonal, we have shifted more of our commercial spend to the second half of the year. Additionally, our procurement team has successfully driven company-wide cost reductions in the first half of 2024. Their primary focus has been on reducing third party supplier rates, and we have seen strong progress in contract rates for raw materials, components, clinical, travel, and consulting services. We continue to see strong adoption in artificial intelligence by our employees, which will allow us to scale the business in an efficient manner with a digital-first mindset.\nOverall, we have built a solid foundation and made purposeful investments in people, processes and technology. We’ve highlighted some of the significant drivers of the Q2 SG&A savings, but we are also seeing additional efficiency savings in R&D and manufacturing. I’m very pleased with the cost savings results in the first half of the year and want to thank our Moderna teams. Now let’s turn to our 2024 financial framework on Slide 12. We are revising our expectation for 2024 net product sales to a range of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion. There are three primary drivers for the updated outlook. First, we are now expecting very low sales in 2024 from EU member states, based on recent feedback and discussions with country health officials. Second, in the U.S. we are seeing increased competitive pressures for our respiratory vaccines. While this has led to a slower RSV ramp than previously anticipated, we continue to believe and mRESVIA’s long term potential. Third, in the rest of the world we have provided for the potential risk of revenue deferrals from 2024 into 2025. We remain committed in our attempt to mitigate these risks, but believe it’s appropriate to adjust our guidance at this time. Finally, this revenue framework assumes a U.S. COVID vaccination rate similar to last season.\nOur second half sales mix will be dependent on timing of regulatory approvals across the world and the number of days available in the third quarter to ship. We currently expect a remaining sales lift of 40% to 50% in Q3, with the balance in Q4. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales for the full year to be in the range of 40% to 50%, based upon our updated sales range. For R&D, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4.5 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 2023. For SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2023. Note that we expect SG&A to be higher in the second half versus the first half, primarily due to increased commercial activity, but still expect the second half to be down on a year-over-year basis. We continue to expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be approximately $0.9 billion. Finally, we continue to expect that we will end 2024 with approximately $9 billion in cash. We have made strong progress in improving our working capital management, which is offsetting the change in our product sales outlook. With that, I will now hand the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you Jamey. Today I’ll review updates from our clinical programs in three of the four development areas in our portfolio. In the second quarter, we had important updates in respiratory vaccines, oncology and rare diseases. Starting with respiratory vaccines, we are very pleased by the approval and ATIP recommendation for our RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, in the U.S. for all unvaccinated adults 75 years and older and in unvaccinated adults 60 to 74 years of age who are at increased risk from RSV. This recommendation was the same as for the other two previously approved RSV vaccines. We also recently received a positive CHMP opinion from the European Medicine Agency for mRESVIA, and as Stéphane mentioned earlier, we are working towards approvals in additional countries. Turning to flu, we are in discussions with multiple regulatory authorities and intend to file in 2024. For our next-generation COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, we announced positive Phase III efficacy results demonstrating non-inferior efficacy against COVID-19 compared to SPIKEVAX in all trial participants 12 years of age and older. Efficacy was higher than SPIKEVAX in adults 18 years and older. We are excited by the data and are sharing the results with regulators and intend to file for approval beginning in 2024.\nRounding out the news in respiratory vaccines development, in the quarter we shared positive results from our Phase III trial with our combination flu and COVID vaccine. The trial met its primary immunogenicity end points with the combination vaccine eliciting higher immune responses against flu and SARS-CoV-2 than the licensed flu and licensed COVID vaccines given separately in adults 50 years of age and older in the trial. In the subset of participants 65 years of age and older, our combination vaccine also elicited higher immune responses than an enhanced flu vaccine that is recommended in the 65 and older age group in many countries, including the United States. These results are exciting, and we have begun sharing them with regulators and planning for the next steps. Turning now to oncology, in the quarter we share an update on our mRNA-4157 program, also known as INT, which elicits anti-tumor T-cell responses by targeting a patient’s unique tumor mutations, or neoantigens.\nINT is in multiple large randomized trials, including two Phase III trials, one in adjuvant melanoma and the other in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer; one Phase II/III trial in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and two randomized Phase II studies, one in adjuvant kidney cancer and the other in bladder cancer. We and our partner, Merck expect to start additional studies in new tumor types. The development program was launched on the back of impressive randomized Phase II trial results in adjuvant melanoma. We recently shared the three-year follow-up data from that trial at ASCO this past June, and in the next few slides, I will quickly summarize the highlights from that presentation. The primary clinical end point for the Phase II adjuvant melanoma study is recurrence-free survival, or RFS. As presented at ASCO, there is a sustained improvement in RFS with the combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA, versus KEYTRUDA alone through three years of follow-up. 74.8% of patients receiving the combination treatment of INT plus KEYTRUDA were alive and tumor-free at three years, which was 19 percentage points higher than KEYTRUDA alone, and resulted in an impressive hazard ratio of 0.51.\nThe combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA also showed sustained improvement in distant metastasis-free survival at three years. 89.3% of patients in combination INT plus KEYTRUDA treatment group were alive and without metastases or distant spread of their tumor at three years of follow-up versus 68.7% of patients in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy group. This is an equally impressive and remarkable hazard ratio of 0.38. Lastly, we were pleased to share data showing an early favorable trend in overall survival at three years of follow-up. Finally on the safety side, INT continues to demonstrate a remarkable profile for a novel cancer therapy. Immune-related adverse events were not higher in the combination INT plus KEYTRUDA arm despite the benefits than in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy arm. This highlights the impressive emerging benefit-risk profile for our INT program.\nMoving now to rare diseases, I’m happy to share that our MMA candidate, mRNA-3705, was selected for the FDA START program. MMA is a rare disease in which patients cannot properly break down proteins from the food they digest; as a result, toxins build up in the bloodstream and cause recurrent episodes of life-threatening metabolic decompensation. The FDA START program is a program designed to accelerate development of new and promising therapies in rare diseases where there is a high unmet need. Our MMA candidate, mRNA-3705 is being evaluated in patients in a Phase I/II study with encouraging early results that we’ve previously shared, and we look forward to working with the FDA to accelerate the development of this promising potential medicine. With that, I’ll now turn it back to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you Stephen and Jamey. Let’s start with COVID. With the start of the COVID season only a few weeks away, contracting for the season is almost completed as we speak. In the U.S., we have seen increased competitive pressure during the contracting season compared to last year, and we have not finalized most of the contracts. We are working closely with public health officials, healthcare providers, pharmacies [inaudible] with these stakeholders are critical in driving widespread vaccination adoption. In the EU, we are in advanced discussions on the tender framework to provide market access; however, based on recent feedback from several large governments, we are now expecting very low sales to EU member states in 2024. Some large countries will not buy SPIKEVAX for the ’24-’25 season. In the rest of the world, we have multiple signed contracts in place, some of which could be deferred into 2025. Contracting discussions are ongoing with some additional countries, but we do not expect this will have a significant impact on our updated sales framework.\nMoving now to launch preparation for the ’24-’25 season, our organization is fully prepared for the upcoming season thanks to the substantial efforts made by the Moderna teams to ensure the global availability of COVID vaccines. In North America, we are ready to supply SPIKEVAX targeting the KP2 strain, as asked by the FDA, demonstrating our ability to quickly pivot and manufacture SPIKEVAX for selected strains. In the rest of the world, we are supplying vaccine targeting the GA1 strain as requested by health authorities in those regions. Let me now take you through details on the U.S. COVID market. We’ll be ready to supply millions of SPIKEVAX doses to all segments of the U.S. market upon regulatory approval. Our goal is to ensure that SPIKEVAX is available to all customers--large retail pharmacies, independent pharmacies, healthcare professionals, IDN and hospital networks, and public health entities at the same time, facilitating early and widespread vaccination. [inaudible] the world healthcare system to be ready to vaccinate is a key priority for us this season.\nTo this end, we have implemented a real-time order tracking system which is available to all of our customers and provides detailed information on every order, including arrival timing, package size, and temperature status. Our supply chain is using AI tools to estimate the optimal order of distribution to locations within the U.S. market. These preparations highlight our commitment to ensuring the broad availability of SPIKEVAX and meeting market demand. Let me now turn to our marketing efforts. We believe education and awareness campaigns will be important drivers to increase vaccination rates. We have started these efforts early. Ahead of the season, we have launched a back-to-basics campaign. This initiative is designed to raise awareness about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus works and why it is critical to get a new booster each year, like for flu. The virus mutates over time and we need to have a new tool to teach your immune system the new mutation to reduce infection, reduce hospitalization, and reduce deaths. Additionally, we are working with public health authorities to educate the public on the impact of long COVID, highlighting how vaccines can help reduce risk for young and middle age adults. Soon, we will start our in-season outreach to high risk groups.\nBy collaborating with major retail pharmacies, we aim to effectively market our products during the season. This targeted approach ensures that our efforts are focused on those who are the most vulnerable, maximizing the benefits of vaccination for those groups. By leveraging media channels, we aim to reach a broader audience and emphasize the critical need for vaccination to mitigate [inaudible] outcomes. Let me now turn to our RSV launch. We are very excited about the launch of our second product, mRESVIA. Following approval, [inaudible] vaccine recommendation on par with competitor vaccines. Specifically, ACIP [inaudible] recommended a single dose of RSV vaccine for all unvaccinated adults age 75 and above. ACIP also recommended a single dose for unvaccinated adults between the age of 60 and 74 who are at increased risk. Based on these recommendations, approximately 40 million people in the U.S. are eligible for vaccination. The RSV market size beyond the ’24-’25 season will depend on re-vaccination recommendations which are anticipated to be discussed by ACIP in future meetings.\nIn RSV, our focus is to direct our efforts to the segments where the vast majority of vaccinations occur. In the U.S., we’re targeting the pharmacy segment, which includes both large retail chains as well as independent pharmacies. Together, the total pharmacy segment accounted last year for around 95% of RSV vaccine administration. We began shipping product in pharmacy in July, and as Jamey mentioned earlier, we are seeing a highly competitive environment. Additionally, larger competitor contracts will negotiate prior to approval and launch, resulting in lower 2024 share than we would have liked.--Long term, we continue to believe our [inaudible] will resonate well with customers, offering them the ability to use their time, maximize efficiency during the busy fall vaccination season, and also reduce potential medical errors. We look forward to some major upcoming milestones in the near term. In respiratory vaccine, we expect a COVID approval and will be ready to ship in the U.S. and rest of the world in the August-September time frame. In RSV, we expect to release Phase III data for high risk individuals 18 years of age and above. We are in discussions with regulators also on our flu program and intend to file in 2024. We also expect to present immunogenicity data in older adults for our flu vaccine, Fluzone HD.\nFor our next-gen COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, we are engaging with regulators and intend to file in 2024. In our combination flu-COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083, we are engaging regulators and hope to be able to give an update soon. [inaudible] fully enrolled and [inaudible] we look forward to potentially Phase III vaccine efficacy readout in 2024. As Stephen just talked about, we are very excited about the INT program and we are looking forward to the completion of enrollment of our Phase III in adjuvant melanoma, which is of course a major milestone. We are keen to discuss with regulators the possibility of accelerated approval based on the Phase II study data. As we shared before, they are treating the review as necessary before we could consider pursuing accelerated approval for INT: first, durability of data, which we believe that as Stephen presented, we are there; second, a substantially enrolled Phase III adjuvant melanoma study, and third, manufacturing readiness at our Marlborough site. Lastly, in our rare disease portfolio, we look forward to initiating a pivotal study for [inaudible].\nWe are eager to achieve these milestones and to continue to progress towards our mission to deliver the greatest possible impact to people [inaudible]. We expect these near term events combined with further advancement in our pipeline will confirm the power of our platform and its potential to serve patients for years to come. An important save the date for your calendar, our annual R&D day will be the morning of September 12 in New York City. Of course, a webcast will also be available. Thank you for listening to the call, and we would like now with the team to take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star 11 again. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple from me here. Can you help us understand the factors contributing to maintenance of the year-end cash balance guidance following the lowered product revenue guidance range? Then with regard to competitive pressures noted regarding contracts for COVID into second half, can you be more specific on the factors here, whether it’s contracting logistics or the clinical profile competitive dynamics, or what that might be? Third, how much visibility do you have on second half demand for the RSV vaccine based on contracting to date? Thank you.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nHi Salveen, I’ll take the first question regarding the year-end cash balance. I would say there’s a few factors in there. Number one, on the deferrals of revenue, some of which we have already collected the cash and ultimately we will collect the remaining balance that might push into 2025, but some of that is already a prepayment. Number two, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have been working on working capital. We’ve got a whole team focused on it, and the teams are doing a great job from accounts payable, inventory balances, receivables and our collections progress. You can see our receivables balance on the balance sheet is relatively small at this point, so the team’s done a great job, which helps offset it. Then third, just coming into the year, we had a little bit of cushion to the $9 billion, so overall we remain confident in the $9 billion and are pleased with that kind of ending balance heading into 2025.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nAnd Salveen, I’ll take the two or the question--it’s Stéphane. On the competitive pressure, I think on both products, COVID and RSV, we are seeing similar things, which is [inaudible] from larger competitors with a portfolio of products, an ability, if you want, to also be much more aggressive on activities, whether it’s supply chain, whether it’s pricing, whether it’s co-marketing funding and dollars activity, so it’s really a mix at the customer level. We’ve just seen much more intensity and pressure on COVID versus last year, and on RSV, as you know, we’re entering a market where there’s two large established players, one with very large market share where of course [inaudible], the other one who, as indicated, they want to gain market share because they are not pleased with their market share last year, and so we have been working really actively on that. In terms of visibility for RSV, we have some contracts that have already been signed and that we are actively supplying customers now that the product has shipped.\nWe have some contracts that are being finalized with ability in season to demonstrate to the customer the value of PFS and to be able to move that into season, so we are working through all of those things. We’ll provide updates as the season goes, but we know this is very important for patients, it’s very important for the company, so we’re all hands on deck on COVID and RSV.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence C. Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me as well. Was just wondering on the guidance cut, if you can quantify how much was from COVID versus RSV, and then on the seasonal flu and the seasonal flu plus COVID combo, I might be parsing words here, but on seasonal flu, I notice the press release said intend to file in 2024, the combo said engaging with regulators on next steps, so maybe you could just help us think through the gating factors for each of those and the difference in language there. Thank you.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nYes, thanks Terence. I’ll take the first one related to guidance and what’s the split between COVID and RSV. What I would say is if you look at the three drivers, all of them are, first, similar in size. Then if I break them down, the deferrals are all related to COVID, the EU is all related to COVID, and then that last category of competitiveness in RSV vaccine--or in respiratory vaccines, there’s a split between COVID and RSV, so that should give you some understanding of the general split between COVID and RSV.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat, and for the question on the language, good pick-up. The 1083 flu COVID program is the most recent Phase III results, really quite fresh, and we have just begun the process of engaging with regulators, meaning sharing that data and discussing with them what their expectations would be on submission. For the other programs that you referenced, obviously we’ve had more time, had some of those discussions, and we’re obviously preparing for submissions, as we said in our prepared remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you guys. Two questions from us. Looking forward on guidance, you obviously have revenue guidance this year, you have opex guidance which we see is around $6 billion of R&D and SG&A, and as you project out to the following years, you have already given cash flow guidance, so if things are generally staying along the same trajectory, I would think that cash guidance would be lower. Can you speak to the math there, and perhaps Jamey, who has said you could flex opex, is that of heightened importance and heighted priority more aggressively as you think about where things stand today in the change of guidance and talk to that, given cash guidance is a big concern for investors? The second question is going back to RSV--I appreciate the comments you just said, that was super helpful in breaking it down. Is that to say that the RSV projections you have are going to be perhaps in half, and is that due to lower share and lower price, and speak to that? Thank you.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nYes, thanks Mike. We are still--as I mentioned, we’re still expecting $9 billion in cash next year and don’t currently have any different change in our outlook for the $6 billion to $7 billion that we said we’d end 2025 with, and let me break that down. First, this year we went from the start of the year, $13 billion to $9 billion, so a $4 billion loss in cash. That included many prepayments coming into the year that will no longer repeat, so we’re not actually getting the cash from operations and that won’t be a drag year-over-year. Second, we plan to return to growth in 2025 and, as I mentioned earlier, some of that will also be buoyed by the fact that we have some deferrals heading into 2025, but more so we’ll have an entire year and operating experience on RSV, we hope to bring new products to market, and so we’re still expecting to return to growth. But yes, I mean, we continue to look at opex and understand what we want to do there, and we are always laser focused on our cash balance, and at this time we don’t think the $6 billion to $7 billion will change.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nOkay, and then on RSV, breaking it down, just a little more specifics on the impact of market share contracting and price, and how to think about that?\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nYes, it’s a bit of both. We’re not breaking it down, nor have we given guidance on RSV, but I would say this year is not turning out as we expected, and I answered Terence’s questions in terms of how much is really split between COVID and RSV, so you can kind of get an understanding there. But again, we were third to market this year, some of the contracts were already negotiated, we only are participating in the second half, but I think our hope is that we get access across many of the retail chains, they start to get comfortable with us with the second product so that when we head into 2025, we can get a more fair market share on RSV.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nEliana Merle\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald Securities\n\nHi, this is Elliott Bosco from UBS on for Eli Merle. Two from us. Can you elaborate on the latest timing you expect for the Phase III CMV study, based on how event rates are tracking, and brd on just the necessary 12 months of median safety follow-up, from a purely protocol perspective, what is the earliest we could potentially get the interim? Then second on international COVID revenues in future years, what do you see as the likelihood of potential deferral again in 2025?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat, thanks for the questions. I’ll take it first. First, we have enough data on case numbers for CMV. We may have an update at R&D day, I’m not sure, but we don’t have any change to our prior guidance, which is we do think that the interim analysis of efficacy could happen this year, and that would account for also median safety follow-up from a timing perspective, and so at this point, no new update, but we continue to stand behind the belief that the interim analysis for efficacy on the CMV program could happen this year.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nYes, and Elliott, on the deferrals, could they happen in 2025, the answer is yes, they can always happen. That said, some of this will push into next year, so, and if some of those push into the following year, those two would offset, but we’re not expecting that at that point. The only thing I’d say is we will come to market with our resilience contracts in the U.K., Australia and Canada, that provides us additional growth in those areas as well as potentially participating in additional public tenders as well, so there’s a little bit of risk but I think we can mitigate it with the deferrals from this year, as well as additional resilience contracts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you. I just have one question regarding the guidance for this year, particularly regarding the COVID revenue in the U.S. It seems contracting is mostly down, and you already also expect similar vaccination rates versus last year, and we know there is mainly only two players, so what could lead to the lower COVID revenue this year from prior $2 billion guidance?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes, thanks Gena. We define competitiveness both in terms of share and in price, so we’re relatively pleased with our market share, there’s potentially some price pressure in there. But generally speaking, we think that the U.S. will perform pretty well compared to last year, but we are seeing a bit of a competitive--a more competitive market this year after a year where in the U.S., we had nearly or approximately 50% market share, so. We’re seeing the pressure but still confident in the overall performance of the U.S. business.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nOh, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe Stephen, quick question on the recent ACIP meeting, it feels to me that the debate before that ACIP meeting was whether RSV was going to be either an annual vaccine or an every-other-year vaccine. However, ACIP clearly chose neither of them and simply said, this is one and done, so two questions. Were you surprised by that decision, and two, how should we think about the market potential for RSV long term, in light of the fact this is maybe a one and done vaccine versus obviously COVID and flu are annual vaccines? Any color there would be much appreciated, and then maybe quickly walk us through what’s the latest thinking on the opportunity for bird flu. Thanks so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you for both questions. Obviously first and foremost, our focus at the ACIP meeting was we were quite pleased with the parity recommendation, and I think we were all pleased with the clear recommendation for those over the age of 75 and those with higher risk from RSV, that they really should get vaccinated. As its only a year old is the market, the most important thing we can do is cover the large number of people who are now recommended, the 40 million-plus who are not vaccinated, and that’s quite a large increase in the number of folks who we hope to cover soon. Now, on the question--the specific question of revaccination, I think it’s also important to say that we are--you know, the ACIP is really just looking at one year of real-world data, and all three of the vaccines, but including mRESVIA, show significant second season protection, although it does decrease, and so there is the decline from season one into season two from a clinical trial perspective, but there’s still protection there in that year two.\nWhile you’re only one year into that public experience--public health experience, I think ACIP took a prudent choice and said there’s still a benefit, and maybe the focus should be on increasing vaccination coverage rates for those who are current unprotected because there clearly is some benefit, even still at that second year. I think if you fast forward a year--and this would be my perception--but if you fast forward a year, if you look at the rates of waning for the other two vaccines than ours, there is clearly a decline from year one to two, and from year two to three. The pace of that decline suggests that by year three, there really won’t be much protection for those people who have received vaccines in the first year. I think that’s when you probably need to start asking the question of, do we continue to leave those people unprotected or boost them again? Now, from a scientific perspective, you asked my view, you will be infected with RSV almost 20 times in your life, you will repeatedly get ill.\nIn fact, many people who are at risk of severe complications over the age of 75 or otherwise with medical co-morbidities, they’ve seen RSV before. It’s the waning protection from that infection that ultimately is the reason why you need a vaccine, and because you get infected multiple times by that virus over life, even if you’ve seen it before, you probably will benefit from a booster in future. And so we continue to believe that as the public health story evolves, that recommending bodies and CDC and ACIP will look at the waning efficacy, the potential to boost people again and hopefully provide additional public benefit, and that eventually there will be recommendations for revaccination for those who are at highest risk of RSV, but it is not our choice. We are providing that data to obviously the regulators but principally to groups like CDC, and then they will determine the right moment, if ever, to recommend that revaccination in the United States. As it relates to bird flu, we continue to follow that very closely.\nIt’s drifted a little bit out of the news more recently--I think that’s a good thing, but the most important news for us has been in the quarter, we executed an agreement with BARDA to advance into Phase III with our pandemic bird flu vaccine, which we’ll provide updates on as we move forward in the months and the year ahead. But we will be sure to be partnering with public health entities across the world, including the United States government specifically. We’re grateful for working with BARDA again in the event that bird flu does emerge as a pandemic or epidemic threatening this country.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Alexandria Hammond with BofA. Your line is open.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Ahead of results for VX-522 in collaboration with Vertex for CF, if results provide positive proof of concept for the ability of mRNA and liquid nanoparticles to be aerosolized and cross the mucus barrier in the lung, can you walk us through additional indications you may be interested in, and should we expect you to develop these indications in partnership with Vertex? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks for the question. We have--as you highlight, there is a large number of pulmonary diseases for which respiratory delivery could be quite impactful. We have not provided any updates on the preclinical programs that we’ve moved into development, and so I would describe those activities right now as still research and discovery phase, and not something for competitive reasons and for scientific reasons that we’ll talk about. They’re in the earlier stages. As it relates to whether we would partner with Vertex on it, we would of course always welcome partnering with Vertex given their expertise, but the partnership we have right now, the deal we have with them is limited to the cystic fibrosis program at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nEdward Tenthoff\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nGreat, thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but I appreciate all the detail. I wanted to ask a little bit about the orphan disease program, and maybe you can provide a little bit of color on what the regulatory path might look like in MMA and PA. Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks Ted. They are somewhat different, and they are in early stages of those regulatory conversations, so we just received the FDA START designation, but if you look at the data that we shared last R&D day, and we’ll obviously provide updates on this going forward, one of the clearer pictures that emerged was that in MMA, we are seeing good movement of a biomarker of methylmalonic acid that’s pathognomonic for the disease, and so you can imagine of the challenges very quickly when you have a good biomarker is how do you validate that biomarker and show that moving that biomarker is reasonably likely to predict benefit, and that’s a scientific question we will work on and ultimately engage with regulators, including FDA, as a key step for moving forward. We are evaluating in the clinical trial folks movement in their biomarker from baseline, so it’s a clear study to run. In the case of proprionic acidemia, there is not as clear a biomarker in the field because of the structure of that particular part of the metabolic pathway.\nAnd so, there we’ve been following events, and as you know, we’ve previously shared in a single-arm study the pre and post treatment rates of metabolic decompensations. We have seen a favorable trend in that--we’re actually quite excited by that. That takes a little more time than a biomarker, but we obviously have been working on that a little bit longer, and so we’ll be engaging with regulators on that single arm approach and understanding the difference between internal controls or other controls to evaluate that. In any event, you may end up with a randomized study, you may be able to use a single arm study, and in the case of MMA, you may be able to use a biomarker, so those are the kinds of conversations we’re having, but as I said, they’re early days. The FDA discussion on MMA just started, and so we’ll provide updates as we have more clarity on those timelines.\n\nEdward Tenthoff\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nGreat, thanks. Looking forward to the R&D day.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jessica Fye with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. For RSV, I’m curious your take on Pfizer’s comment that customers want to carry an RSV vaccine that could address both maternal and the older adult population. Then for INT, I saw it on the near term milestone slide, but to clarify, what’s your latest projection on when you expect to complete enrolment of the Phase III adjuvant melanoma trial, and what’s the latest you can share on manufacturing progress for that product? Are there any updates to share on how that’s going? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\n[inaudible]--Sure, I’ll take that. Obviously the majority of the recommended population in this country continues to be the older adults. I wouldn’t comment on Pfizer’s competitive positioning on our quarterly call except to say that in the retail channel overwhelmingly and in many physicians’ offices overwhelmingly, the focus is on protecting older Americans. What’s happening with the younger population, maternal population is obviously smaller in terms of an overall market opportunity. We do recognize the need to try and provide the broadest potential label and, as we’ve previously updated, we are pleased that we’ve conducted our Phase III study in 18 to 59-year-old high risk populations, and we intend to file that this year with a goal of expanding that label for those who are at high risk for medical reasons and may benefit from an RSV vaccine, even if they are younger. I would say we agree that a broad label is valuable, but I think it’s important to cover as many people as possible, and that’s what we’re excited by moving forward with our 18 to 59-year-old filing.\nOn the question of INT, we have not with our partner, updated yet on where we are in enrolment. Obviously as we had said at ASCO, and there was quite some coverage of risk, we are pleased, very pleased with the pace of enrolment, and we do expect that to conclude quickly, but we have not yet provided any updates and we’ll obviously do so at the appropriate time with our partner, Merck. As it relates to manufacturing, we actually have made great progress there, establishing our Marlborough facility, as well as demonstrating through the clinical trial our ability to manufacture at high volume, frankly commercially relevant volumes, and so we’re--we feel like we’re in a good place in terms of the manufacturing trajectory. It’s still a few months of work to go this year to get to where we want to be, but we’re starting to feel quite optimistic that the manufacturing will be online as and when we hope.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Wang\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking the questions. A few from me. Just first, just given the comments on the higher competitive environment, how are you thinking longer term about the outlook for RSV and COVID versus some of the [inaudible] you made earlier in the year and historically, just given some of the pricing and market share dynamics there? Second, with COVID and the EU tender, what’s your level of confidence in the EU being a meaningful contributor in 2025, and what changes between now and then? You know, does having the combo or potentially having a combo add to competitiveness there? Lastly, I saw that you guys purchased a PRV, is that for use on the combo or the standalone flu, and are you comfortable in getting ahead of the potential June recommendation next year? Thanks.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.",
    "content2": "Thanks, this is Stéphane. On the high competitive environment on COVID and RSV, what we believe is on RSV, our customers are going to experience the PFS product, and that’s going to be ability to really have full season, to be able to try and get the products to a channel that will have lots, so we anticipate in ’25 to have better share than in ’24 for the U.S. We’re going to be launching probably outside U.S. markets in ’25, that’s of course we’ll not have sales in ’24, so that’s all going to be important for growth. In COVID, we believe the portfolio in terms of next-gen COVID and then flu plus COVID, it’s going to be an important driver to kind of reset the expectation moving forward and the market dynamics. In terms of the EU, the current contract between Pfizer and the EU ends in 2026, so we think 2025 and 2026 are still going to be low.\nSome countries have actually used a lot of our vaccine and so we could see some countries in ’25 and more in ’26 needing COVID vaccine and then wanting to diversify their supply base, [inaudible] vaccine as well, given its performance. So as you mentioned the combo, it’s something that we have been discussing quite a lot with governments in Europe. They see the value of a combo given its strong performance, as we’ve shared, to be an important tool for public health in terms of compliance. In a world where governments are worried about people getting their flu shot, and their COVID shot, and their RSV shot, that’s just a lot of shots and nobody likes needles, nobody likes to go to the doctor or to the pharmacist, and so the combo is something that customers are really valuing, so that could be another opportunity in countries when this product is available to go back into growing Europe. The key priority for us in Europe now for 2025 is really launching RSV and growing the business on RSV until we see the flu mono or flu plus COVID launch.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nHi there, this is Greg on behalf of Tyler from TD Securities. I am more interested in your thoughts on the magnitude of the RSV market. [inaudible] small in relation to last year during earnings, so do you agree? And what is your latest thinking on the overall sizes of the RSV market in elderly patients versus the prior that you built you’re your expectations?\n\nLavina A. Talukdar\n\nHead-Investor Relations, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYou broke up a little bit during your question. I think we caught the tail end of your question, which is what is the size of the RSV market, relative to what we thought previously?\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nYes, thank you. Just to reiterate quickly, I believe that GSK discussed the RSV market being smaller this year relative to last year [inaudible] earnings. Just didn’t know if you agree with that and what was your latest thinking on the overall size versus the prior $6 billion to $8 billion estimation [inaudible].\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes, so let me try to take a stab at it. As Stephen stated, in the long term we believe that as real-world evidence data is gathered by public health leaders, that they will most probably be in for boosting. The current recommendation is what it is, but as Stephen said, we believe it will potentially evolve over time. For this year, I think what is interesting is on paper, it seems that it could be a smaller market. The thing that’s going to be interesting to see how it plays out in terms of market size and number of doses in arms is the guidelines are much more clear than last year, and as you know, sometimes in vaccinations, you get a better reaction from the doctors and pharmacists and consumers with clear guidelines versus not as clear guidelines with larger population potential. Because of those two factors, it’s going to be interesting to see how the season plays out.\n\nOperator\n\n[inaudible] Our next question--oh, sorry about that.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nI would just comment on the current year market size as well. I think we talked about what we believe the patient population is, which is still sizeable, and we believe that the market will still be overall sizeable this year and similar to last year, if not a little bit more. I think there are other factors at play with those comments, you know, there was a lot of inventory that was--or a lot of sales that happened in the prior year, that customers may be sitting on some of that inventory, so from a revenue perspective that might be different, but from a vaccination rate perspective, we believe that it will still be similar, if not a little bit bigger this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Cory Kasimov with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nCory Kasimov\n\nHi, good morning. This is Adi on for Cory. I have a question on has the recent summer COVID surge caused any concern for fall vaccinations as the infected population is usually recommended not to get vaccinated for six months post infection, and is the base case for the U.S. COVID revenue similar vaccination as last year, which I think per CDC tracking was 22.5 overall population and 14% for 65 and above?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes, I’ll take it. First, the question on the summer wave and the epidemiology, we’ve seen this multiple years in a row now, and so in some ways, there is a move in certain geographies towards a little bit of a summer wave. It just highlights the fact that this virus is incredibly effectively at spreading, incredibly effective in creating disease even for folks many years after vaccination and other protection, and why we need to protect people for the winter season, because whatever we see in the summer, you see a dramatically higher wave in the November through February time horizon, and so that’s really where we’re trying to protect people for. But in terms of does the summer wave impact, the small summer wave impact the view of the fall wave, it really doesn’t change year-over-year that perspective, and that’s why we’re confident vaccination coverage rates will still be there, and as Jamey said, we see them the same--we hope to do better, but we see them minimally as similar to last year in the United States.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today’s call. I’d like to turn it back to Stéphane Bancel for any closing remarks.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you everybody for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to many of you in the coming days and weeks, and if not, seeing you for R&D day on September 12th. Have a great day, bye.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Welcome to the Moderna’s First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you need to press Star 11 on your telephone, you'll then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press Star 11 again. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina A. Talukdar\n\nHead-Investor Relations, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's first quarter 2024 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the investor section of our website. On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning, or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a review of a business, Jamey will then present our financial results. Stephen will review our late-stage clinical programs and I will close by sharing our 2024 commercial priorities and major upcoming milestones. Our COVID vaccine has already impacted hundreds of millions of people. I'm excited by the progress we've made with our pipeline that has the potential to impact many more people. During the first quarter, we presented substantial clinical progress during our vaccine date with exciting data on EBV, VZV, and norovirus. In addition, along with our partner Merck, we expanded studies for individualized neoantigen therapy, INT, into three new indications. In addition to our ongoing Phase III studies in adjuvant melanoma and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer, a Phase II free study has started in neoadjuvant and adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, another form of skin cancer. Phase II clinical trials have started in adjuvant bladder and adjuvant kidney cancer. Together, our vaccines and therapeutic portfolio have a potential to impact hundreds of millions of people each year.\n\nI am pleased with our Q1 performance. Since the beginning of the year, we announced four important business agreements and collaboration. We entered into a non-exclusive IP out-licensing agreement with a leading pharmaceutical company in Japan. The agreement includes a lump sum payment and low double-digit royalties to Moderna on net sales of COVID-19 products marketed in Japan by this company. It is nice to see a company recognizing our IP and asking us for a license. Second, we recently announced a contract to provide 12.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the Ministry of Health in Brazil. I am very pleased with this partnership as it is the very first time that Moderna works with the Brazilian government and we look forward to providing these doses to protect people in Brazil as they go into their winter season. We announced a project financing program for up to $750 million in funding with Blackstone to further develop our flu program. We also made public our collaboration with OpenAI to use AI as a transformative tool to increase speed and efficiency, and ultimately, to improve patient outcomes across our business. Finally, we agreed to Metagenomi to terminate our gene editing collaboration. All rights granted under the collaboration will be returned to Metagenomi. It is a good proof point of Moderna's continuing to prioritize our assessment for best opportunities to drive returns.\n\nTurning to Q1 financial results. In revenues, we were ahead of our plans at $167 million, reflecting the highly seasonal nature of our respiratory vaccine business. The net loss was $1.2 billion. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of cash and investments. We communicated during the November call our focus on financial discipline. I am pleased with what the team has achieved. Our operating expenses, cost of manufacturing expenses, plus cost of R&D expenses, plus cost of SG&A expenses were down almost $800 million in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023. Jamey will elaborate on this in his section. With that, I will now turn to Jamey.\n\nJamey Mock\n\nThanks, Stéphane, and hello, everyone. Today I will walk you through our financial performance for the first quarter and provide commentary on our 2024 financial framework. Let me start with our commercial performance on Slide 8. Net product sales for Q1 were $167 million, down 91% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales volumes of our COVID-19 vaccine in regions outside the United States. This decline aligns with the anticipated transition of the COVID-19 vaccine market towards a seasonal pattern. Whereas in the first quarter of 2023 we primarily delivered doses that were deferred from 2022. Q1 was driven by sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world, largely Latin American markets. For Q2, we expect about $100 million in sales for a total of approximately $300 million in the first half of 2024. Q2 will include a portion of our recently announced contract with Brazil.\n\nMoving to Slide 9, net product sales were $167 million as I just explained. For the first quarter of 2024 our cost of sales was $96 million, which included third-party royalties of $8 million, inventory write-downs of $30 million, and $27 million related to unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind-down costs. This resulted in our cost of sales representing 58% of net product sales up from 43% in the same quarter last year. The increase in cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the lowest level of sales in the quarter. We continue to expect the full year cost of sales to be approximately 35% of product sales. However, due to the strong seasonality of our business, we expect a higher percentage in the first half.\n\nMoving to our R&D efforts, Q1 R&D expenses were $1.1 billion, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. This reduction was primarily due to the absence of upfront collaboration payments being made this quarter. The upfront payments made in the first quarter of 2023 were related to our strategic collaborations with Generation Bio and Life Edit. With the Q1 spend of $1.1 billion, we are tracking towards the full year expected spend of approximately $4.5 billion. Q1 SG&A expenses were $274 million, marking a 10% decrease year-over-year. Importantly, this decrease was driven by all functions in SG&A, and it is a result of our strong focus on cost discipline and strategic investments driving productivity. I will provide additional color on the next page.\n\nWe reported an income tax expense of $10 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of $384 million in the same period last year. The shift is primarily due to the continued application of evaluation allowance on the majority of our deferred tax assets, which we first established in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the period was $1.2 billion compared to net income of $79 million last year. Diluted loss per share was $3.07 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.19 in 2023. We ended the first quarter with cash and investments totaling $12.2 billion, down from $13.3 billion at year-end 2023, largely attributable to research and development expenses and operating activities.\n\nMoving to Slide 10, I want to take a moment to elaborate on the efficiencies we are now seeing across the company. As a platform company, we have the opportunity to build a unique operating model. And over the last few years, we have invested purposely into people, processes, and technologies to build foundational capabilities that will allow us to scale efficiently. First, we ended 2023 with nearly 6,000 employees, up from 1,300 at the end of 2020. Every function scaled capabilities to enable the increasing product launches we expect over the coming years. Additionally, as you know, Moderna has always led with a digital-first mindset. Over the past three years, we have nearly doubled our built-for-purpose software applications to digitally enable our teams. As an example, we recently went live with a newly implemented rebuilt ERP system. SAP 4 HANA is our new digital backbone for all our operational activities. We've used SAP in the past, however, it was built for a research and development-focused company. And now we have implemented an entirely revised version supporting our end-to-end business processes more effectively and efficiently.\n\nAnother example is our rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. Over the past year, we've built over 750 GPTs. One example in the legal space, our Contract Companion GPT streamlines the task of reviewing and summarizing contracts across the business, with the GPTs providing step-by-step guidance to craft a tailored, insightful summary. This enables any function to extract critical insights from contracts whenever needed, minimizing bottlenecks, and freeing up Moderna's legal department to focus on work of higher strategic value, thus enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making.\n\nAnother example in G&A is a purchase-to-pay GPT for all questions around our procurement and payment processes. Instead of our employees having to find and read policies and procedures, they can easily query the GPT. It also saves time for our procurement and payables teams from answering numerous questions. AI has already changed our way in a short period. In general, we see the area developing at an incredible speed that allows for an unprecedented impact on productivity in many areas. We have rolled out a comprehensive training program and are committed to driving this technology breakthrough. As a result of these strategic investments in the people, processes, and technology, we were able to significantly reduce purchased services and our use of external consultants, which contributed heavily to the 10% year-over-year reduction in SG&A spend. We are also seeing similar benefits in R&D and manufacturing. In general, we now have a solid foundation with our operating model. As we continue to grow our commercial activities, we will need to further invest, however, we will be able to do that more efficiently.\n\nNow let's turn to the 2024 financial framework on Slide 11, which is in line with what I shared on our last earnings call in February. We continue to expect net sales for 2024 of approximately $4 billion, which we think will be a low point as we expect to return to growth in 2025. Sales in the first half of the year are now expected to be approximately $0.3 billion. We continue to expect cost of sales of approximately 35% of product sales for the full year. For R&D, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4.5 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 2023, rest we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2023. And we expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately $0.9 billion. Finally, we expect to end 2024 with approximately $9 billion in cash after touching a low point of approximately $8 billion at the end of Q3 due to the seasonality of collections.\n\nFinally, let me also touch on our recently announced project financing deal with Blackstone, which we are excited about. In March, we entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement, which commits Blackstone to providing us with up to $750 million of funding for our flu program so that we can strengthen the product label and fulfill our remaining regulatory applications. Subject to the regulatory approval in the United States, which depends on data from the funded activities, Blackstone will be entitled to receive up to $750 million in sales in milestone payments. These milestone payments are contingent upon achieving specified cumulative net sales targets for our future influenza and combination vaccines. Additionally, Blackstone will earn royalties on applicable net sales at a low single digit percentage rate. This funding will offset R&D expenses and is factored into our R&D framework for the year of approximately $4.5 billion. Overall, we are excited that this deal enables us to accelerate the advancement for our pipeline. And with that, I will now hand the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you Jamey. Today I will review updates from our clinical programs that were shared during our recent Vaccines Day, as well as new developments in our therapeutics portfolio. Starting with respiratory vaccines, we shared updates to many of our respiratory programs at Vaccines Day in March. Our RSV vaccine candidate is undergoing regulatory review in multiple countries, and pending approval we expect to launch the product in the United States following the June ACIP Meeting and Recommendations this year. At Vaccines Day, we shared updates from core administration studies of RSV confirming the ability to administer our vaccine and other vaccines given during the respiratory season. With our flu program we have recently presented data from our Phase III P303 study at ESCMID, and continue discussions with regulators globally toward the goal of filing this year. For our next generation COVID vaccine and mRNA-1283, we've presented positive Phase III safety and immunogenicity data and are engaging with regulators on the path to approval for that product. Our combination Flu and COVID vaccine mRNA-1083 is in Phase III, and we look forward to sharing those clinical data in the current quarter.\n\nTurning now to our latent and other vaccines. I shared at Vaccines Day, we've had - we've made significant progress in this portfolio. Our CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, has fully enrolled its Phase III trial, and we have the potential for an interim analysis of efficacy this year. We announced positive Phase I immunogenicity and safety data from our EBV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1189, and we are now advancing towards pivotal trials with that program. A second therapeutic EBV candidate, mRNA-1195, is in a separate ongoing Phase I study. mRNA-1468, our vaccine against varicella zoster virus showed strong immunogenicity, including strong T cell responses, and we are preparing to move that program forward towards a pivotal Phase III study as well. And our HSV vaccine against herpes simplex, mRNA-1608 is now fully enrolled in its Phase I-II study, and we look forward to sharing clinical data updates when that's available. Now, rounding out this portfolio, we presented the positive clinical data from our norovirus vaccine candidate mRNA-1403, and shared that we are advancing that program towards its pivotal Phase III trial.\n\nTurning now to Oncology Therapeutics. We are happy to report our ongoing Phase III studies are enrolling well. We were excited to announce three new INT trials, including a randomized Phase II-III study in neoadjuvant and adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a randomized Phase II trial in adjuvant high risk muscle invasive bladder cancer, and lastly, a randomized Phase II trial in an adjuvant renal cell carcinoma. Now, recently at AACR, we presented Phase I data from our INT program in advanced unresectable HPV negative head and neck cancer in the metastatic setting. At AACR we also presented Phase I translational data from another oncology therapeutic program, mRNA-2752 in various tumor types. Links to both of these presentations are provided on the slide. Now, as a final note, at ASCO we will be hosting another Moderna oncology event on the evening of June 3rd and we look forward to seeing you there or having you join us virtually. With that I'll turn it back over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you Stephen and Jamey. Slide 18 is an overview of our COVID-19 strategy for 2024, which is focused on the needs of each region. In the U.S. our focus is working with public health officials, healthcare providers, and pharmacies to increase vaccination coverage rates. In Europe we are actively participating in the 2024 tender process. The tender allows for up to $36 million per year for up to four years. And in the rest of the world we have reoriented our commercial teams to prioritize markets for greater commercial focus and impact. As mentioned earlier, the Brazil contract is an example of how this is working.\n\nIn the Fall of 2023, U.S. COVID vaccination rates lagged behind flu vaccination rates. U.S. COVID vaccination rates were 11%, with flu vaccination rates at four times that. And yet COVID continues to show a higher burden of disease. U.S. hospitalizations for COVID between October 2023 and last week were 424,000 people which is markedly higher than hospitalization from either flu or RSV infection. Actually, COVID hospitalizations were around the same level as hospitalizations of flu plus RSV combined. In addition, long COVID coughs continues to be a serious risk. Too many healthy young adults in their 20s, their 30s, their 40s are losing lung capacity and/or mental capacity due to long COVID. The data shows that COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of long COVID by 70%.\n\nWe believe education and awareness will be very important. We are working on educating consumers about the need for an annual COVID vaccine just like flu. Too many people are getting hurt when we have safe and effective vaccines available. Our job will not stop until these hospitalization numbers come down significantly. As you know, strength detection will help authorities receive approval and launch of COVID vaccine. Health authorities, including the W.H.O. and EMA in Europe, have recently selected JN 1 strain for the 2024-2025 formula. The FDA will host the VRBPAC Meeting on May 16th to select a strain for the U.S. market.\n\nModerna has already manufactured JN1 drug substance to support the potential August launch. We have also prepared for backups in case the FDA does not select JN1. In 2023 COVID vaccines were available five weeks later with flu vaccine. In the recent channel alone, more than 3 million flu vaccines were administered before the updated COVID vaccines were available. As we look into the Fall 2024 season, we see the potential to align the timing of flu and COVID vaccine approvals. We are encouraged by an earlier VRBPAC for this year's COVID front selection versus last year. And we're working with the FDA and regulators to offer timely COVID approval. We expect higher vaccination updates if COVID vaccines are available sooner.\n\nTurning now to the anticipated launch of a second respiratory vaccine, or RSV vaccine, which is expected to launch into a large market. In its first year, the older adult RSV market was $2.5 billion in sales, and analysts expect the older adult market to grow between $6 billion and $8 billion per year. With marketing applications filed in markets globally, we anticipate seeing approval beginning in the first half of 2024. In the U.S. we are targeting a launch after the June ACIP meeting. We're very excited to bring a product with a strong differentiated profile to market. Our vaccines has shown stronger efficacy and safety data in clinical trials. And will be the only product available in a pre-filter range of PFS presentation.\n\nLet me now double-click on what we believe are the benefits of PFS. We recently published a time-and-motion study that shows faster preparation time for PFS relative to vaccines that require constitution. Recall that both RSV competitors' vaccines on the market require multiple steps to prepare their vaccines for administration. One vaccine requires four steps and the other nine steps to prepare. Our PFS presentation is ready to use vaccine straight out of the box. The study found that PFS presentation to be three to four times more efficient as measured by preparation time. Details from the study can be found through the link on the slide. We believe our PFS presentation for RSV vaccine has the potential to ease the personal burden on pharmacies during the fall respiratory season. Big pharmacies chains but also independent pharmacies were looking forward to launch.\n\nLet me close with major upcoming pipeline milestones. While we are excited about our commercial prospects for the year, we are even more excited about the upcoming pipeline milestones and the effect they will have on our commercial outlook for the next several years serving patients. In respiratory vaccines, we are eagerly awaiting the approval of RSV and ACIP. We are also waiting for data for RSV in the age group 18 and above. We are in discussion with regulators on our flu program, and intend to file in 2024. With our next-gen COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, we are pleased with positive Phase 3 immunogenicity data and are engaging with regulators.\n\nOur flu plus COVID vaccine combo should get its Phase III data soon. In latent, with CMV fully enrolled and occurring cases, we look forward to potential for Phase III data efficacy data in 2024. In INT program, we are looking forward to completion of our enrollment for Phase III adjuvant melanoma study. In addition, we are keen to discuss the possibility of accelerated approval with regulators brd on Phase II study data. As we shared before, there are three things we view as necessary before we could consider pursuing accelerated approval for INT.\n\nFirst, durability data from our Phase II study, which we announced in December last year. Second, a substantially enrolled Phase III adjuvant melanoma study. And third, manufacturing readiness at our Marlboro site. And last but not least, our REVD portfolio, we look forward to initiating pivotal study for PNMMA. This milestone will represent continued progress toward our mission to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicine. And as Moderna, we are dedicated to achieving them all. Every data continues to confirm the power of our platform and its breadth in the service of patients. Two important save-the-dates for your calendars. We will discuss oncology program in Chicago on June 1st and our Annual R&D day will be held in New York the morning of September 12th. Thank you for listening and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press Star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press Star 11 again. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, could you discuss your strategy for pursuing contracts for the RSV vaccine, given two approved vaccines that have a head start timing-wise and help us understand, if you've communicated with large retail pharmacies, how significant the PFS formulation is to them? And then secondly, with regard to moving into the three new indications for the INT program, maybe help us understand signals or specific data points that support that? Thank you.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGood morning. On the RSV contract, so as you know we're not allowed to contract until the product is approved by the regulator. But what we are doing, because we can do that, is our medical team actively engage with retail pharmacies, but also IDN hospital networks, in terms of making sure the data on the efficacy profile of a product, on safety, and of course on the PFS and the benefits of PFS in terms of productivity. Those discussions are ongoing literally on a daily basis, including with leadership of those pharmacies. And the next step, of course, is to wait for the FDA approval. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYeah, sure. So, thanks for the question. So, on the three additional INT indications, I think the short version of it is they are all adjuvant settings, similar to our melanoma Phase II results is encouraging where our KEYTRUDA has a known benefit, and where we still believe that there's an opportunity to improve upon that by driving a specific T cell response with INT. And so, as you know, in Phase I we looked across a range of different indications. That was more in the metastatic setting. But as we announced, since we first saw that positive Phase II results from melanoma, we have been aggressively pursuing adjuvant indications where IO is approved, and where we see an opportunity in all three of these fits squarely in that space.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. Two questions as well. On RSV, I guess the competitor GSK as well this week was commenting about how they are expecting you to be in the mix and contracting is ongoing. I know you have some RSV in your guidance. I think the math implies maybe hundreds of millions of dollars. Can you just perhaps comment on how you adjusted or probability adjusted or thought about how much is there in your guidance and your confidence on that for this year? And then secondly, on INT as well, I know you have some data at ASCO. I know you have breakthrough therapy and prime designation. How important is the Phase III enrollment progress, the confirmatory study, I feel like that's always an important discussion with FDA, so how important is that progress before you can really engage with FDA? Thank you.\n\nJamey Mock\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll take the first one. Thanks, Mike, for the question. So, as you may know, we haven't guided any specific guidance or number for RSV. In the past, we did break down the 4 billion into three different segments around the U.S. market, the APAs we locked into the year with, and then another category of other COVID sales that didn't have any APAs across the rest of the world. So, a good example is Brazil that we just signed, as well as RSV. So, no specific guidance for RSV from a financial perspective.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nAnd on the question of INT, I think you nailed it. It's a really important topic. In particular right now, as we think about accelerated approval, that we demonstrate the diligence and substantially enroll the confirmatory study. So, really all you're waiting for is for that study to mature, could be several years. We think it's really important. To be fair, we have not consulted with the agency on that yet. As we've said, we're waiting until we've crossed our own threshold and also at this point until we've established the manufacturing facility or outlined site to them. But we do feel that, as we've said, substantial enrollment demonstrating that essentially all you're waiting for is the readout on that confirmatory study is our obligation before we even want to go full of that question. We are making great progress this year, and we're optimistic that both that and the facility will be available in short order. And then, of course, we'll want to start engaging with our data, including the FDA on the question of accelerated approval.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two parts for me. Just on the RSV vaccine, can you provide your latest perspective on what the most likely ACIP recommendation will be, will you get a parity recommendation to the competitors or do you think there's a potential for a differential recommendation here? And then just wondering, any update on your ongoing conversations regarding filing your seasonal flu vaccine, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but just any more insight in terms of what the guiding steps are here? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks for both questions. So, first on RSV, caveat by saying we have to complete the approval process with FDA. And then at the end of the day, the recommendation really falls to ACIP and the committee members that defer to them. Our expectation, our hope, is that when they review the data package that we already have, as well as additional data that we expect to be able to share at the ACIP meeting on durability through a second season and on immunogenicity across other populations, we expect a parity recommendation. We certainly think the data supports that. But again, I'll defer to the committee members on the ultimate decision. On the question of flu, we are actively engaged right now with regulators on the process for submission of the flu vaccine. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are also closing in on clinical data from our combination flu COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083 and that obviously has an important role in our engagement with regulators generally on flu versus flu COVID combinations. And so, those discussions are ongoing. I won't provide any other update on it, except to say, as we said today, and we continue to say we expect to file the flu product this year. But it will be dependent upon a number of considerations, possibly also including the COVID data that we expect soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ellie Merle with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nEllie Merle\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. On CMV, how are you thinking about the need or benefits of potentially boosting, both from a clinical, as well as a commercial perspective and if you would study this? And then second, just on CMV, if you don't meet the interim analysis there, would you disclose that? Thanks.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nSo, first on the question of boosting. So, so far, what we have, we actually don't have the efficacy readout yet; that's the phase three studies ongoing. But we do expect to have quite substantial durability data on immunogenicity, and if that's possible, the efficacy data will give us a signal of what the correlation of progression could be. And so, we don't right now have any evidence that they're not good, durable, multi-year, possibly a long five-year to continue to track immunogenicity protection. It's possible that they will stand out for 10 years, and then some boosting is necessary. It's also possible that we decide that a booster might be necessary for a term of now, say, five years or 10 years. We just don't know at this time. And so, at present, the data we do have on the durability of immunogenicity looks quite strong.\n\nAnd so, we do think a three-dose series will likely be productive for a very long period of time, all subject to the efficacy data that you just referenced. So, on the interim analysis for efficacy, as we've said before, we're making great progress in that study in recurring cases and we do expect to be able to provide an update on or conduct at least an initial interim efficacy analysis this year. Because of the rate of case accrual and also because the protocol calls for us to cross a median of one year follow-up, the timing may be such that by the time we get to that first interim analysis, we also have enough cases for a final analysis or that a final analysis is imminent. Let's say it's a very short period of time away. And so, because of that uncertainty, until we see that data and understand how close we are to that final analysis, I don't think we can commit one way or the other, whether we're going to be updating. It will really depend upon the data we see and then how quickly we expect to get that final analysis. At the end of the day, if we have news to share both on the interim and the final, we, of course, will. But I don't think we can commit at this stage because we haven't seen the data yet.\n\nEllie Merle\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nHartaj Singh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you for the question. I just have a question on, you're developing a refrigerator stable vaccine and flu vaccine, I believe. And I'd just like to kind of understand how you think about that, when could that get approved, and then will the combo vaccines also be refrigerator stable? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Hartaj. So - [technical issues].\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please stay on the line. And, pardon me, can you hear me now? Could you try speaking again, your line was muted.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYeah. I'm here. Can you hear me?\n\nOperator\n\nYeah. We can hear you now. Your line got muted, but you can go ahead and continue.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat. Sorry for that brief interruption. So, Hartaj thank you for the question. Just to quickly restate what I was saying. All of our respiratory protocol portfolio, RSV, flu, COVID, and the flu COVID combo are being developed toward refrigerator stable PFS. And so our mRNA-1083 program, the flu COVID program, as well as the flu program are intended to be refrigerator stable, prefilled syringes. As Stephane mentioned a moment ago, we really view that as the ideal presentation now, whole presentation for healthcare providers really around the world to facilitate their delivery of the vaccine to patients.\n\nHartaj Singh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Stephen.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you for taking my questions. I have two. One is regarding COVID. So for the EU, you say up to 36 million doses every year in EU. What could be the scenario, you can get 36 million doses in EU and also the price in Brazil and the EU, should we use pandemic price of $25 to $30 per doses as the benchmark? Quickly on key accelerator approval pass based on today's comments and the prior discussion, our impression as you could achieve all the three key components by the end of this year, is Merck is also fully on board to submit for the accelerator approval in melanoma?\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gena, it's Stephane, I will take the COVID question and then Stephen will talk about INT. So, the tender is up to $36 million. It will depend on the number of countries that apply to the tender for the EU. So, this we will know at the end of the process. And as you know it is a tender process so there's no dialogue which is enshrined all the files and all the data and that's really ongoing, but we are obviously very active on it. And on price for obvious competitive reasons, we're not going to share price in the markets because probably it doesn't know the price right away. Stephen, INT?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYeah. So, we haven't specifically got into when we expect to complete, obviously, the second and third parts of our three-part criteria, that being manufacturing readiness. As you can imagine work is going on around the clock, as well as the enrollment where we've made great progress, but you have to sustain that progress. On your question of where's Merck on this, I think you'll have to direct it to them. Our view is that if we're able to get to the point where until your approval is appropriate, and regulators are supportive of that, we can't imagine why ourselves and Merck wouldn't want to make the product available to help people suffering from cancer right now. But the contingencies there are obviously we have to do our work and our diligence this year. And then ultimately, we have to speak to regulators, and they get to decide whether that pathway is available to us. And so, I think for both ourselves and our partner, Merck will want to defer to regulators ultimately on that choice.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe a very quick one on RSV. I think the last press release actually cited May 12th as the PDUFA date. While today, you're simply saying the initial regulatory approvals is in the first half of 2024. So, is there anything to read to it, can you just confirm that the PDUFA date is still May 12th, which is actually the end of next week? And then, maybe second on IP, can you just comment on the recent decision by Judge Goldberg to rule in favor of Arbutus or you're looking on a particle, our understanding, this can have pretty material impact on both prior and future sales of COVID, so again, any thoughts there, much appreciated? And then, super quickly on INT. Stephen, what's holding you back on starting the randomized trial intended at cancer into metastatic studies, I thought the data at ACL was pretty impressive so, any thoughts there, much appreciated? Thanks so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you for the questions. I'll take this first from the third very quickly. So, on the question of RSV, we continue working toward the same PDUFA date, and there's no change to that. As you know, there's a lot of work and around the clock work by ourselves, obviously, and folks at the agency. And so we're hopeful that, that happens as planned, but if it takes a little bit longer, at the end of the day, what really matters is the - meeting, but there's been no change to report. So, don't read anything into that. As far as the INT question, on head and neck, I appreciate the question because we are also obviously enthusiastic about that data. However, our partner, Merck and ourselves, we have not yet decided where that fits in the priority of other indications, pathologies, and opportunities we're pursuing. As you've already seen in the past year, we've stood up a very large number of study. And we're just trying to pace ourselves. And so, it will take us a little bit of time with our partner, Merck to determine what the next steps are in head and neck. And at this point, we do not have an update on it.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you. I'll take the IP questions. I mean as you know, our COVID-19 vaccine technology, including our lipid nanoparticle delivery system is the result of independent research and development. We have a strong belief that our technology does not impact on the patent asserted by Arbutus. We are confident in our position, and we look forward to presenting our case and trial next year.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few here. So for INT, I know you mentioned you can't comment on when you expect to complete the manufacturing scale up. But can you provide a status update on where you stand with that today and the number of patients you can support right now, as well as where you want to take that capacity once you get to the end of this three-phase scale-up process, even if you don't put a timeline on when you'll get there? Next one is coming back to flu, can you just refine a little bit when the 1083 immunogenicity data will be available and maybe elaborate on how the combo data play a role in the regulatory tox on 1010, I thought you previously said these products could stand on their own and that you might not need 1010 approved to get 1083 approval, so now wondering kind of why 1083 might factor in for 1010? And then lastly, on CMV, can you remind me how the risk of CMV and pregnancy compares in seropositive versus seronegative individuals, I'm thinking from a commercial standpoint, how you weigh the strategy of pursuing vaccinating everyone versus just seronegative people? Thanks.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you for the questions. I'll start with the INT question on manufacturing, then Stephen can add. So, we have not provided some capacity numbers of the factory in Marlboro. But of course, as you can assume, we know the size of the melanoma market. And we know our stronger data. We have plenty of people benefiting from the Phase II data. So we've sized the plant accordingly, as you can imagine. But also, we are building the plant of care because, as you know, Stephen and his team and his colleagues are running a lot of studies. So, this is not a platform in melanoma. Again, from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't care which cancer is in terms of organ because we use genetic information to design an individual product for every human being. So basically, we bought a plant last year that was kind of a big building finished, saves us time to market.\n\nObviously, we don't have to get the permitting and build the building. And so the team since then, that is now more than a year ago, has been working actively to get the plant ready. And the plant we will reviewing in modules inside the building. So basically, we're going to launch with the first module of manufacturing capacity. And then - and one day maybe we do an opening of a facility like we did for Norwood. You will see that there's another empty space left behind, which has also a very quick ramp-up because the HVAC system and all the utility has been set up for the entire plant. And so then you just add modules as you go. So, we'll be able to scale very quickly as we get more indication available. But again, we're aware of the melanoma number of cases. And so, the plant will be sized so we make sure we can provide products to patients. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you for the clarifying question on flu. So, let me just start by saying that independently, we are looking to submit both the flu program and the flu COVID combo program. So, that's 1010 and 1083. Obviously, we need to see the 1083 data, and we'll announce that when we have it. The question on the timing of that data, it's imminent. And so, in the coming quarter, we expect to be able to share that update. The point about interdependency, I suppose, is just more about sequencing of those submissions and in some places and some regulatory geographies, obviously, you can't stack them on the same day, if you will. There's a logical sequence and what we will want to assess once we see the 1083 data is our regulatory strategy as well as our preparation and delivery of data for the submissions to determine which one will go first or second.\n\nBut at this point, we're trying hard to make sure that we can do both products across all of our major markets, if the data is filed this year. And so, we'll go more on that as we move forward. But for now, we are proceeding without independent sorry for the confusion in your model. On the question of CMV and seropositivity. So, it's a really important point. Thank you for raising it. But while the majority - well, the risk of vertical transmission of CMV to pregnancy to the fetus is highest in seronegative. It does happen in seropositives as well. So, congenital CMV is a disease that's seen in - particularly in reactivation or sometimes reinfection, even in the seropositive context. And so, we do believe that there's a potential for benefit for a vaccine even in the seropositive population. We are evaluating the study right now in seronegative because the rate of that transmission and obviously, the potential to prevent against infection is more enriched and therefore the study primarily are focused on seronegatives.\n\nBut we are looking. We have studied the vaccine from a safety perspective in seropositives. And we are looking at things like shank, if you draw a little bit of an analogy to correlate to the EBV data that we've already put out there in a different virus, but we've been able to show that we can really control the rate of setting even in seropositive is the simpolovirus. And so, we have some reasons for optimism and believe that when we pull together the totality of the data, there will both be the obvious potential benefit, which is that there is still vertical transmission in seropositives and some - potentially some data on the rate of - that would be supportive to that. Ultimately, though, we're studying all the way down to 16 year olds. And our goal will be a label that 16 plus, with the goal going into a population that is not as highly seropositive as it is later in life and therefore, we see a very large opportunity, and primary infection in CMV with the vaccine and potential positive for [inaudible].\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with BofA. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nAI Assigned\n\nHi, this is Alex Hammond on for Geoff Meacham. Thanks for taking our questions. So, on your zoster vaccine candidate, when should we receive updates on your pivotal strategy and is there any color you can provide today in terms of your current thinking on the Phase III design? And then our second question is on the PA and MMA programs that are advancing into pivotal trials, can you provide any thoughts on the nature of editorial and the comments on safety? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes. Could you describe about the first part of the question was on which program? The booster?\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThe zoster, the shingles.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nShingle booster, thank you. So, on the VZV program, we have - we're obviously very excited by the Phase I data which was compared against a licensed product, and we saw really strong T cell response in immunogenicity. And generally, we've been seeing that across our programs. But in that one, it was very encouraging. We're in the process right now of trying to find the pivotal strategy that will include, obviously, dose selection, the number of doses in that study and then how we're going to expect that study. We do not have an update today on what that will look like in addition to our own thoughts on it, we obviously want to consult with regulators before we finalize that. But we are moving toward a pivotal study in VZV. We do not have any more update yet.\n\nAs it relates to MMA and PA, the clinical data that we have continues to show a compelling benefit risk profile, good safety profile. In fact, in the PA studies, we have many folks who've been in those study on drug for well over a year. And over 30 years, I think, from our last update in overall patient dosing experience. So, we are starting to get a very clear perspective on the safety profile. The editorial question, I don't have a view on editorials or opinions based on the preclinical data. I think we stand behind the clinical data that we have and are quite encouraged by that profile, and we'll continue to watch it closely in our ongoing Phase I studies, but we do not have any specific or new concerns based on the clinical data today.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. One moment.\n\nEvan Wang\n\nGreat. Two from me. First, on the combo 1083 program, so data, it sounds like this quarter, I believe enrollment was completed a few months ago. So, I guess how comprehensive will the top line update be in terms of follow-up? And then with submission, is longer-term vault needed there and are there parallels from 1010 that we can take in terms of regulatory filing speed for 1083 or is that more impacted by the decision for buying one or the other first? And then second, on RSV, it's kind of early ahead of approval, but with some international markets, it seems that's more nascent in terms of establishing some reimbursement there. So, I guess how are you thinking about positioning internationally? Thanks.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you. So, for the 1083 data, yes, on this quarter, and I would say that we're - we enrolled the majority of the 1083 studies you know last fall. And the 1010 second-generation study. So, we talked about the P303 study. The first part of that enrolled over last summer, just a few months before the combo study. And the second part of it, there was a part B and C, as you know, looking head-to-head against Fluzone HD, that actually enrolled the same time as the 1083 study last fall. And so, they've been actually kind of tracking right on top of each other. I think we're going to wait to see the data before we can provide growth guidance on timing. But obviously, we're - we've been working toward that flu COVID combination product for a while, and we will want to make sure that we get that filed, if it is positive as fast as possible. I wouldn't draw too many, because of the difference in the structures of the study between the P303 study, which has a part A and the B and a C, and the 1083 study, which was done very quickly. I wouldn't too many correlations between - reading out and the timing for submission on either one. Stephane, do you want to take the RSV question?\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nSure. So, the internal markets, obviously, very important, the U.S. is very important, the U.S. - international also super important. As we shared before, we found in all the major geographies already. Of course, EU, U.K., Canada, Australia, some countries in Asia, some countries in the Middle East. RSV is well known by public health leaders like it is in the U.S. So, I think that there's a very strong desire, again, to protect the elderly with what we are doing here in terms of flu COVID RSV, that's becoming very kind of a standard that probably [inaudible] across at least the developed world. But even in developing countries, there's more and more interest as you see aging population everywhere. So, it's not only the U.S. approval that we expect coming soon as we have several geographies that would start being approved.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Ltd.\n\nThank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may. Just in terms of the timing on the CMV interim data. You said this quarter, it could be as early as the end of 2024. That sounds slightly later than you had previously said. I just wondered if that's me over-interpreting the semantics or whether there is a slight delay there? And then the second question is on the HSV vaccine. Previous quarters, we talked about the EBV vaccine and the potential utility in multiple sclerosis. I was just wondering what your thoughts were about HSV and it's the hypothesis that implicates its role in Alzheimer's disease? Thanks so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you for both questions. So, first on the clarification. There's no change to our expectations on when the CMV readout will happen. I think we previously tried to be careful in saying that we expect it to happen this year. And so obviously, by the end of this year, it is meant to say the same thing, but there's no change in our expectations at this point. On the HSV Alzheimer's hypothesis, it's a very interesting - there's a lot of neuro-inflammatory questions that go with the Herpes Simplex virus infection across a range of different mutations, Alzheimer's one of them. At this point, the studies that we expect to move forward with HSV will be for seropositive to improve outcomes. So, shedding-based for instance, or lesion-based.\n\nAnd then eventually, we will want to consider whether we want to go at prevention of infection, which is obviously a different standard of different indication. That might be more relevant for them, how you think about some of the neuro-inflammatory or long-term supply. I think you asked my opinion on it, I think it's incredibly interesting and exciting. I do think it's early for us to start drawing connection from a vaccine perspective, in terms of our potential impact for it. I hope over time, there is an opportunity to intervene and things like that. Obviously, in the EBV vaccine with multiple sclerosis, that science has firmed up to the point where there's reasonably high conviction that there's a potential for benefit there. We have to go prove that. But at this point, it's still earlier days, I think, with HSV and Alzheimer's.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Ltd.\n\nOk. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nEdward Tenthoff\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And congrats on everything. Actually, most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to ask with respect to the cancer efforts, are you able to break out what the actual R&D cost is for that program and that's still a cause some profit share with Merck? And how many indications do you guys ultimately plan on pursuing? Thank you so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nMaybe I'll take the first one, Ed. So, we obviously know what we're spending, but at this point, we are not prepared to disclose. So, maybe someday, but not at this time.\n\nJamey Mock\n\n[inaudible] - Yes. On the expansion indication, look, it is a joint decision, our partnership with Merck has been really strong. We've been building this out. We do like to review those strategically and then bring them forward once we've started them. And so, I don't want to get ahead of that because those are our private strategic competition with Merck. But we are not done yet. We will keep adding in the years ahead.\n\nEdward Tenthoff\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nVery exciting. Look forward to seeing you in Chicago.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Stephane for any closing remarks.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, everybody, for joining in today for a great session. We look forward to seeing you at the latest ASCO. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

Welcome to the Moderna Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question, you'll need to press *11 on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press *11 again. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the investor section of our website. On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a review of 2023. Jamey will then present our financial results. Stephen will then review our late-stage clinical programs, and I will close by sharing our 2024 priorities.\nLet me start with our mission. Moderna's commitment to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines. In 2023, every member of the Moderna team helped to advance our mission, which is a driving force that motivates our team every single day. We impacted more than 100 million people around the world. And we advance our development pipeline across all of our franchises, including infectious disease, oncology, and rare disease.\n2023 was a difficult year as we transitioned from a pandemic to a seasonal endemic market. We reported sales of $6.1 billion for 2023, which was at the low-end of our financial framework range. These sales exclude the recognition of $600 million of deferred revenue from Gavi. In the U.S., the vaccination rate was down year-over-year.\nWe are pleased that our U.S. commercial team drove an increase in our retail market share from 37% to 48%. Outside of the U.S., we were not able to compete in the EU market in the second half of 2023 due to a competitor contract, and our performance led to a low market share in Japan. We did have a strong performance in Israel, Switzerland, and Taiwan.\nWe took several important actions in 2023 that will set our commercial COVID business up for success. We resized our manufacturing footprint, which has been established to support capacity at pandemic levels. We exited contract manufacturing relationships and reduced inventory levels. These initiatives will improve cash flow from our COVID business moving forward.\nWe also flattened the commercial structure. All regions report directly to me now for more targeted self-execution and also better integration with the global teams. We focus our R&D spending and our SG&A expenditures towards near-term growth and higher return on investment projects.\nWhile sales were challenging in 2023, our development team had a great year, with excellent progress across many of our late-stage pipeline programs. In 2023, we advanced our pipeline and now have nine late-stage programs. Let's start with the respiratory vaccine.\nFor RSV, we filed for approvals around the world. We reported positive data from a flu P303 study. And we are fully enrolled in the Phase III studies for our next-gen COVID, mRNA-1283, and the flu-plus-COVID combination vaccine, mRNA-1083. In our latent franchise, we are very excited that our Phase III CMV trial is now fully enroll. In our individualized neoantigen therapy program, or INT, where we partner with Merck, Phase III studies in adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are enrolling. We purchased and are currently building out a manufacturing site in Marlborough, Massachusetts to enable commercialization of our INT program. Already, these therapy programs continue to progress well.\nWe are in dose selection for the registrational study of a propionic acidemia program. In MMA, we are pleased to see improvements in biomarkers and clinical outcomes. In research, we made 6 external investments, including 1 acquisition, which we expect will increase the strategic reach and also the breadth of our mRNA platform.\nNow turning to our 2023 financial summary. We reported GAAP revenue of $6.8 billion, a net loss of $4.7 billion, primarily driven by mostly non-cash charges of $3.7 billion related to resizing of manufacturing, and the tax valuation allowance. We are pleased to end the year with cash and cash investments of $13.3 billion dollars.\nLet me turn to Jamey for more color on the financials.\n\nJamey Mock\n\nThanks, Stéphane. and hello, everyone. Today, I will review our financial performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023. I'll also provide our financial framework for 2024. Let me start with a review of our commercial performance this year. In the first half of 2023, we reported product sales of $2.1 billion with the majority of sales from advanced purchase agreements signed for delivery in 2022 that were deferred into 2023. We do not expect these sales to repeat in 2024.\nIn the second half of 2023, we recorded $4 billion in sales from seasonal endemic demand, and an additional $600 million from deferred revenue related to GAVI. Sales in the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, with $0.8 billion in sales in the U.S., and $0.6 billion in Europe and $1.4 billion in the rest of the world, including the deferred revenue from Gavi. For the full year 2023, product sales were $6.7 billion, comprised of $1.7 billion in sales in the U.S., $1.4 billion in Europe, and $3.6 billion in the rest of the world, again, including deferred revenue from Gavi.\nMoving to side 10. As mentioned, net product sales were $2.8 billion this quarter, a 43% decrease from last year. This was largely attributable to the anticipated reduction in sales volume, which was partially offset by a higher average selling price. This decrease is indicative of the evolving market dynamics as we navigate the transition of the COVID-19 vaccine market towards a more predictable seasonal pattern like traditional flu vaccine.\nCost of sales was $929 million, down from 39% of net product sales in the previous year to 33% this year. This is a demonstration of our strategic efforts in Q3 to resize our manufacturing footprint, which, as expected, led to additional charges in Q4 of $169 million, primarily related to the wind-down of certain contract manufacturing operations. Additionally, cost of sales also includes an inventory write-down of $322 million, reflecting revised demand forecasts.\nR&D expenses increased by 16% to $1.4 billion. This uptick reflects our commitment to advancing our late-stage clinical development program, particularly with our RSV vaccine, CMV vaccine, combination vaccine against flu, and COVID-19, as well as our INT program. The increase also included an upfront payment of $120 million associated with the strategic research and development collaboration with Immatics.\nSG&A expenses were $470 million, up 25% year-over-year. The increase in spending was primarily due to the expansion of our commercial operations, particularly in the U.S. market. Income tax with a benefit of $147 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, largely attributable to the tax benefits as part of finalizing our 2022 U.S. tax return. Net income for the quarter was $217 million compared to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.55 compared to $3.61 in 2022. We closed the quarter with a strong cash position of $13.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the $12.8 billion we had at the end of the prior quarter.\nNow, let's turn to our annual performance on page 11. Net product sales for the full year 2023 were $6.7 billion, a decrease of 64% from the previous year, mainly due to lower sales volume of our COVID-19 vaccine. As mentioned earlier, this includes the recognition of $0.6 billion from deferred revenue related to Gavi. Excluding this item, our sales of $6.1 billion were still in line with the framework we provided for the full year.\nCost of sales for the full year represented 70% of net product sales, a substantial increase from 29% of product sales in 2022. This shift is largely attributable to our strategic efforts to optimize our manufacturing operations, resulting in charges of $1.6 billion and other manufacturing and distribution costs over reduced sales volume. Overall, the cost of sales came in at $4.7 billion, slightly below the $5 billion we provided in our latest framework. Research and development spend was $4.8 billion, and SG&A was $1.5 billion, both in line with our expectations. Our income tax provision was $772 million for the full year 2023.\nDuring our Q3 earnings call, we discussed the requirement under GAAP to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when the current year and cumulative income projection for the next three years is in a lost position. It's important to note that future income from products not yet approved by regulators are excluded from these income projections, which restricts us to just our COVID vaccine, and it does not include expected future launches. This valuation allowance does not impact future cash flows, future cash returns or the company's ability to utilize deferred tax assets in future periods.\nNet loss for the year was $4.7 billion, compared to net income of $8.4 billion last year. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower product sales and higher R&D expenses in 2023. Diluted loss per share was $12.33 compared to diluted earnings per share of $20.12 in 2022.\nSo now let's move to slide 12. We wanted to provide you additional perspective on our full year financial results by presenting them alongside a summarized version that excludes the impact of the GAVI deferred revenue recognition, or resizing charges, and the tax valuation allowance. Our total GAAP net loss for the full year was $4.7 billion. However, when excluding these primarily non-cash items, the net loss is reduced to $1.6 billion.\nNow let's turn to our 2024 financial framework on slide 13, which is mostly in line with what I shared on our Q3 call. We expect net sales for 2024 of approximately $4 billion, which we think will be a low point as we expect to return to growth in 2025. Sales in the first half of the year are expected to be approximately $100 million, reflecting the strong seasonality of respiratory vaccines. We expect a cost of sales of approximately 35% of product sales, in line with our cost of sales framework, which we introduced in our Q3 earnings call last year.\nFor R&D, we expect full-year expenses to be approximately $4.5 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 2023. And for SG&A, we expect full-year expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion, down from $1.5 billion in 2022. We also expect taxes to be negligible in 2024.\nIn our Q3 earnings call, I provided our Moderna operating principles, which largely centered around a very disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our #1 priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the business. In addition to the investment into our pipeline, we expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately $0.9 billion, as we mostly complete the construction of our facilities across the globe. Our teams are laser focused on operational improvements for both expense management and working capital. As a result, we expect to end 2024 with approximately $9 billion in cash.\nI will now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamey. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll do a quick review of our clinical highlights from our late-stage programs in 2023, and then look ahead to anticipated milestones in 2024. While we have over 40 programs in development, they'll focus on our late-stage pipeline, which consists of nine programs across four franchises, all made significant progress in 2023. Four of these programs are in our respiratory vaccine franchise. We hope to launch all of these potential products by the end of 2025. I'll discuss this further in a moment.\nThe other five late-stage programs are spread across latent vaccines, oncology therapeutics and rare disease therapeutics. We hope to begin launching these in 2026, and I'll discuss our progress in these areas as well. In infectious disease vaccines, we've achieved many important clinical milestones in 2023. Within our respiratory vaccine franchise, we filed for RSV vaccine approvals in many countries around the world. We recently presented follow-up data from our Phase III study at the RSVVW meeting that I'll recap in a moment.\nIn our mRNA-1010 flu program, our Phase III P303 study met its primary safety endpoints and hit all eight co-primary Immunogenicity endpoints against all strains of influenza. We're also excited that we fully enrolled the Phase II Immunogenicity and Safety study of our next-gen COVID vaccine and the Phase II Immunogenicity and Safety study of our Flu and COVID combination vaccine. In our latent and other vaccines franchise, we're proud of the great progress our team made to complete enrollment in the Phase III study of our CMV vaccine in 2023. That study is now accruing cases towards its first interim analysis of efficacy.\nOn slide 17, I want to briefly review the primary analysis for our RSV vaccine, which was first shared in January of 2023. The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints, leading the DSMB to recommend Unblinded. Vaccine efficacy was 83.7% against RSV with two or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease at a median follow-up of 3.7 months with a wide range of two weeks to 12 months of total follow-up. The primary analysis also showed 82.4% and 68.4% vaccine efficacy against three or more symptoms and acute respiratory distress, respectively. These data were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December of last year.\nWe've continued to follow the participants in the trial and announced follow-up data at the RSVVW conference earlier this month. And an additional analysis showed sustained vaccine efficacy against RSV, with VE of 63.3% against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, with two or more symptoms, through a median follow-up of 8.6 months and a maximum follow-up of 17.7 months. The vaccine efficacy was 74.6% against RSV lower respiratory tract disease, associated with shortness of breath, which has been shown to be a key driver of seeking higher levels of medical care and the associated burdens and costs.\nSlide 19 summarizes the overall timing of enrollment, primary efficacy analysis, and subsequent analysis overlaid against the epidemiology of RSV over the two seasons that have now contributed to the efficacy in the trial. Our trial enrolled steadily over 13 months between November 2021 and December 2022. As a result, the primary efficacy analysis included cases from both the smaller RSV season of 2021 and 2022 and the much more significant RSV season of 2022 and 2023. Due to enrollment throughout the year, the median follow-up of the primary analysis was 3.7 months. But as I noted, the maximum follow-up was 12 months. The primary analysis met its success criteria leading the study Unblinding.\nWe continue to pre-plan additional analysis on April 30th, 2023. At that analysis, the median follow-up was 8.6 months, with a maximum follow-up of 17.7 months, or put another way, approximately 17,000 participants were between 9 and 18 months of study follow-up at the time of the analysis, with many completing their second RSV season on the study. Per protocol, we are continuing to follow cases through one year, but it is evident from the epidemiology, very few cases would be expected in the six months after the April 30th cutoff date from the last analysis.\nIn summary, we are pleased that the data shows sustained efficacy through two seasons, including the large RSV season of 2022-2023. And we look forward to providing further updates from this ongoing study. We also achieved clinical milestones across our therapeutics franchises in 2023. In oncology, our individualized neoantigen therapy developed in partnership with Merck, began Phase III clinical studies in both adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Both Phase III trials are now actively enrolling.\nOur primary analysis from the Phase II study was recently published in The Lancet, giving greater detail on the two-year follow-up data that we had released in 2022. Now, in December of 2023, we shared top-line follow-up data from that same Phase II study in adjuvant melanoma patients, confirming the durability of the initially reported responses. At a median follow-up of now three years, the recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival remained extremely favorable, with a reduction of the risk of recurrence or death by 49% and a reduction of the risk of distal metastasis or death by 62%. Both results were highly statistically significant at three years.\nAnd in PA and MMA, our most advanced rare disease therapeutic programs, we continue to see positive clinical data in our Phase I/II studies, including improvements in biomarkers and clinical outcomes, such as metabolic decompensations.\nNow returning to slide 21, while we're proud of the progress in 2023. We have much more ahead in 2024. Let me take you through some of the late-stage milestones we anticipate for this year. I'll start with our respiratory franchise, where we are targeting the first approvals for our RSV vaccine beginning in the first half of 2024, with commercial launches shortly thereafter.\nWith our flu vaccine, we're in discussions with regulators about potential submissions for approvals, and we expect to begin filing this year. Phase III data from our next-gen COVID vaccine is expected in the first half of 2024, which will inform the next steps. And we expect Phase III data for our flu and COVID combination vaccine this year. In latent vaccines, we are looking forward to potential efficacy data from our CMV Phase III study. In Oncology, we expect continued progress enrolling our two Phase III studies in INT for adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We also expect to expand into additional tumor types this year.\nAnd finally, in rare diseases, we expect to move into registrational studies for both PA and MMA in 2024. It'll be a very busy year, and we look forward to sharing progress with you as the year progresses.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen and Jamey. For Moderna and the patients we serve, 2024 is all about execution: execution in commercial, execution of all late-stage pipelines, and execution with financial discipline.\nStarting with commercial. First, our COVID vaccine. We will continue to work with health authorities to increase vaccination rates and improve public health by reducing the substantial burden of disease from COVID in this upcoming 2024-2025 season. While I am pleased with the U.S. market share outcome of the current season, I believe we can and must do better on vaccination rates. Our team is actively working on it already. A few weeks ago, the EU published a new mRNA COVID vaccine tender, up to 36 million doses per year for up to four years. Our team is actively working to respond to this tender. We are prioritizing our commercial focus on specific markets around the world to deliver where it matters the most.\nMoving to RSV vaccine candidates, we are very excited about launching the RSV vaccine this year. That will be the launch of our second product our mRNA platform is delivering. The FDA PDUFA date is May 12th. If the outcome is positive, we anticipate that ACIP will include mRNA-1345 on the agenda in late June. In Europe, we expect Germany to launch in 2024. We also expect Australia to launch this year, while other markets will likely launch in 2025.\nIn many markets around the world, we need to secure regulatory approval before we can participate in tenders. As communicated last year, given expected approval outside the U.S., Germany and Australia will anticipate launching early in this market in 2025.\nThe RSV market is estimated to be a $10 billion opportunity, consisting roughly of $6 billion to $8 billion in older adults and $2 billion to $4 billion in the pediatric and maternal set. In 2023, the first-year RSV vaccine launches, consumer awareness of RSV, and demand for the RSV vaccine were strong. The 2023 adult RSV vaccine market was around $2.5 billion. This is quite impressive; even if it was the first year that the vaccines were available, they were not even available for a full year, and the products were not approved in many countries. With the 2023 RSV vaccination rate as a small percentage of the total addressable market, we are quite excited to launch our product into this large and growing market.\nLet me now turn to our RSV vaccine profile. We believe we have the best profile to serve patients and compete in the RSV market, efficacy, safety and ease of use. Our clinical data shows strong vaccine efficacy. We have a well-established safety and tolerability profile that leverages the same mRNA technology that has been delivered in over 1 billion COVID vaccines. Additionally, we have not seen any cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome or GBS in our Phase III trial.\nWe expect to be the only company to offer an RSV vaccine in ready-to-use pre-filled syringes, or PFS. Our one-step administration compares well relative to competitive products and requires multiple preparation steps by pharmacists and clinicians. As you know, whenever a company sells a product requires nine steps of preparation for each consumer needing an RSV vaccine, and the other competitors' products require four steps of preparation.\nWith over 90% of U.S. RSV vaccines given to date in the pharmacy setting, PFS presentations offer ease of use, time saving, and the potential to reduce medical errors. Given the labor shortage in retail pharmacy channels, we anticipate our PFS presentation will be welcome by pharmacists in a very busy respiratory vaccine season where pharmacists need in addition to their regular tasks to administer the flu vaccine, COVID vaccine, and RSV vaccine.\nToday we talked about how much progress we made in the late stage pipeline in 2023. This year, we look forward to continued execution and reporting milestones in each of these programs.\nIf you look at this slide, it is going to be a very busy and very exciting year with multiple Phase III readouts, like the COVID next-gen, also flu plus COVID Phase III data, and potentially CMV Phase III data. But we're also going to be finding products like flu, which will be our third product file and, of course, approvals in many countries around the world for RSV.\nFinally, we are all committed to exercising financial discipline across the business. While we have resized our manufacturing footprint in 2023, we will continue to find ongoing cost improvements in manufacturing. We will reduced operating expenses in R&D and SG&A and prioritized programming R&D with near-term commercial potential in areas of unmet medical needs.\nOverall, our CAPEX will be up mostly--modestly in 2024 compared to 2023, and we'll mostly complete construction of several important plants in Marlborough, Massachusetts for INT and Canada, the U.K. and Australia In 2025, we expect CAPEX to be down significantly. We are also targeting working capital improvement.\nAnd importantly, as you know, we are adopting AI across the business, which we expect to save time, increase productivity, and drive scalability in addition to cost savings. Our use of AI is increasing by the week. And new use cases are exciting to see how teams are embracing this new tool across the business.\nIn summary, 2024 is an important year of execution across our company, one that we set the stage for the next several years. I am very excited by how our company is positioned. I believe 2024 will be a year where many observers of Moderna go from thinking of us as a COVID-19 vaccine company to seeing Moderna as an mRNA platform company with several products approved and more approvals on the way for 2025 and beyond. Over the next few years, our ability to deliver on our mission will increase significantly and be very meaningful for our teams.\nWith that, Operator, we'll be now happy to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press *11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press *11 again. And to accommodate everyone in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We'll pause for a moment while we compile our Q+A roster.\nOur first question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nHi, guys, good morning, and thanks for the question. Focusing on RSV, I know you made a number of nice comments about comparing the data. Maybe you could talk two or three points. One is perhaps how it will work in the commercial market in the U.S. with contracting. Is it contracting season, or do you have to have contracts? And how does that work between the two different other competitors? And secondly, how would that work at the pharmacy level when either patients or doctors are making the selection, given the fact that Pfizer and GSK both have similar sales but different profiles? Maybe talk about those two different things and how you expect that to play out for this year? Thank you.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you Michael. I'm Stéphane. So in terms of contracting, obviously, we cannot start contracting now because our product is not approved, but our medical team has been quite engaged across the board at medical conferences, talking to healthcare professionals, and sharing the great data that was published in December, as you know, for our Phase III in the New England Journal of Medicine. So we have active discussions.\nThere is quite high excitement about the possibility, again, if a product was to be approved, to get a prefilled syringe product. As we discussed in my remarks, as you know, labor shortages are a big issue in pharmacy. For any of us that have gone through a pharmacy in the fall, you could see it was very busy, sometime a bit too hectic. And so the leadership of a big retail pharmacy is very engaged to think about COVID versus RSV and how to simplify the workflow, how to reduce medical errors, which is why those medical discussions that we're having so far give me a significant hope that our products will be meaningful tools for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gena Wang from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you. I have two very quick questions. The first one is regarding the RSV vaccine. What portion of 35,000 to 36,000 participants that completed two seasons? And regarding February 29 ACIP meeting, what additional data you will be presenting? And very quickly on 2024 guidance. Now we have a better understanding of both COVID and RSV market size for 2023 and 2024 seasons. What could be the upside or downside for your 2024 revenue guidance of a $4 billion?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat, thanks, Gina. I'll take the first part of that. So I actually can't--I don't know, off the top of my head, the proportion because there are both Southern and Northern Hemisphere participants that were enrolled in the study. And so counting the two RSV seasons will depend upon that.\nIt is a sizable proportion because, as I said, the maximum follow-up at the additional analysis is about 18 months. Median was 9 months. And so, by definition, about half, as you just said, about 17,000 participants were between it. And we did enroll pretty continuously over 13 months, not exactly evenly, but pretty close to it. So I don't want to give you an inaccurate number, but I would suspect it is a pretty sizable proportion because of that steady, pretty consistent enrollment over the course of 13 months. It's not exactly equal, but it trended that direction.\nAs far as additional data for the ACIP meeting, we will obviously continue to provide updates from any additional analysis we're doing on durability. We obviously have Immunogenicity data as well as data across different subpopulations. And if we're fortunate enough to have the opportunity to present at the ACIP, we will, of course, listen to the committee on anything they would like to see as well on the performance of mRNA-1345 as a vaccine and the performance of vaccines in general in terms of durability as it guides decision making around repeat dosing or boosting on some schedule in the public health.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephen. And Gena, it's Stéphane. On the upside and downside on the sales for this year, I think on the upside, obviously, the COVID in Europe, as I just mentioned, we couldn't participate in the market last fall. The new tender is an opportunity for us to participate. Quite a number of doctors, hospitals, public health leaders have actually complained that the Moderna vaccine, given the higher efficacy reported for reduction of hospitalization, was not available, especially for the elderly, for immunocompromised people. So that's an interesting upside.\nOf course, the vaccination rate in the U.S., as we reported, the vaccination rate in the current ending season was lower than last year. As I said in my remarks, we need to do better to protect more people. And our team is actively already working in a cross-functional matter to address the VCR and increase the vaccination rates. And the other upside could be the RSV both the market growth, as well as our share, how quickly can we get share from the current two solutions available.\nOn the downside, of course, the vaccination rate could be a downside. And the other one is, of course, the timing of the RSV launch, given we rely on regulators for the approval of products and then public health recommendations, like CDC over different ITAGs in different countries, that could, of course, delay launches and, of course, impacting sales. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ellie Merle with UBS. Your line is open. \n\nEllie Merle\n\nHi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just turning to CMV Phase III, can you talk a little bit about what you would view as clinically meaningful or commercially relevant on vaccine efficacy? And if successful, also, how are you thinking about use in seronegative versus seropositive patients? Thanks.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nFor sure. So thank you for the question. So in CMV, you know, obviously, there's currently no vaccine that can prevent an infection against CMV. And as it is a source of devastating birth defects, anything that provides a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection and therefore vertical transmission would be, we think, terrific. Now, the minimum bar that we are powering in our study would support is a vaccine efficacy of approximately 50%, as we've shared previously, anything above that would obviously exceed our expectations and be incredibly exciting for the field.\nWe are in the Phase III study enrolling both seropositive and seronegative participants, and part of the reason for that is that there is currently no broadly used diagnostic. And so we want to demonstrate benefit or safety in both populations because we do believe that the most likely use of the vaccine could be that it's given regardless of sero status to both seronegatives and seropositives. And there are potential benefits for seropositives that could include control of shedding or viremia or other long-term sequelae of CMV, but we would have to prove those.\nAnd again, those are not something we're exploring explicitly in the current Phase III study. So as a practical matter, from a labeling perspective and a launch perspective, our goal is to try and launch the product for both seropositives and seronegatives so that no diagnostic would be needed, and it could be broadly used across populations to try and prevent the devastating effects of CMV on vertical transmission to newborn babies.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nHartaj Singh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you. You indicated that you're going to complete enrollment for CMV this year and maybe have a readout. Can you just walk us through the steps of how that would look like, and maybe just give us some ideas on powering statistical assumptions? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes, of course. Thanks, Hartaj. So we're currently fully enrolled, and we're accruing cases in that study. I think, as we've shared before, we've actually made substantial progress in the number of cases. It is a case-driven endpoint, and we'll need to see approximately 80 cases before we do the first interim analysis for efficacy. That-- 81 cases to be specific. That interim analysis strategy will look a lot like our other vaccine efficacy studies. DSMB will evaluate that data. And if we meet the statistical threshold, which is for early efficacy, meaning we're doing better than our minimum of 49.5% vaccine efficacy, then they will, at that moment tell us to unblind and share the results. And of course, we will share them broadly with the world.\nIf, for whatever reason, we don't quite have the statistical power in that first interim analysis of efficacy, the study has power to continue on and continue to recruit cases towards a final analysis of efficacy. Now, given the rate of the final analysis at 112 cases.\nNow, given the rate of a case accrual that we're currently seeing in the study, we do expect that we will have more than enough cases this year. We are, therefore, pretty confident that we are going to be seeing a readout from the interim analysis, possibly even a final analysis for efficacy in 2024. But again, since it's case and event driven, we just have to bide our time. And ultimately, we will depend upon the DSMB to tell us whether or not we've met that statistical threshold.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe, Stephen, on INT, maybe you could remind us what's your latest thinking in terms of potential for accelerated approval there for melanoma?\nAnd then maybe on the additional tumor types that you guys and Merck are thinking about it, could you just maybe talk about what the tumor types that you're contemplating and whether those tumor types are going to be in the adjuvant settings or in the metastatic settings?\nAnd then maybe on RSV quickly, can you just maybe expand on durability in the context of your competitor? Is there a scenario where ACIP recommends the GSK vaccine for every other year versus your vaccine for every year? Any color there, much appreciated. Thanks so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nQuite a few questions there. I'll try and get them all. I apologize if I forget any one. So, first, on the question of INT and accelerated approval in the adjuvant melanoma setting. So, as we've said before, we continue to be really excited by the data, and are excited to start looking to talk to regulators about it.\nThere have been three things that we've tried to say that had to be true for us to believe it was appropriate to even ask about accelerated approval. The first was we had to see durability. And clearly, the data that we just saw from December, just two months ago, shows that durability and really a clear statistically significant result where the comparator arm, the control arm, looks really just like the labeled data. And so, we're incredibly encouraged by that durability. That was criteria one.\nBut the second and third are still there and really important. The second is that we have to substantially enroll the confirmatory Phase III study for an accelerated approval in this space, we do believe we have to show we've really already done the diligence to allow that confirmatory data to come in so that three or four years from now, that further readout would confirm anything that would happen in accelerated approval context.\nAnd then the third and perhaps, now increasingly important criteria was that we had to establish the commercial manufacturing facility. And so, as we've announced, we've been building a facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It will be a purpose-built, personalized, individualized, neoantigen therapy facility that is ultimately what will be licensed to create this product for the world, whether it's in an accelerated context or in the future with full approval. That facility is coming online. We look forward to hosting many of you and others in tours as we bring it online. But without that facility, there isn't really a product here to talk about.\nAnd so, all three of them are essential. We're making progress on all three. And I think the most exciting thing is what you were just alluding to, which is the durability of the benefit we've been seeing really causes us to now lean into completing-- working hard to complete the enrollment in that confirmatory study criteria 2 and finish the build-out of that Marlborough facility, which is the third criteria.\nNow, on the point of other indications that we're going after, we will--I will defer to our partners, Merck, on the specifics. We will do it together at the right time, opening up additional Phase III and confirmatory studies. We do expect to open multiple this year. Those include some additional adjuvant indications. They also include some potential metastatic indications, and we are looking at monotherapy indications. And that can be either in places where PD-1s, KEYTRUDA, may not be indicated or even earlier lines of therapy. And so all of those are under consideration. And as soon as we start those studies up and begin enrolling, of course, we'll make announcements about them with our partner, Merck.\nNow, lastly, on the question of RSV, we continue to be really enthusiastic about the data that our product has. And I think the durability now shown through these-- through the second large season is quite encouraging. We'll be sharing that data with the ACIP. Well, first, we have to get through the regulatory process and approval in this country. And Stéphane mentioned our PDUFA date in May. And if we have the opportunity, we'll be sharing the data with the ACIP, which includes, in our case, booster data on immunogenicity from ongoing work that has actually already previously been presented publicly at meetings.\nAnd so, just like our competitors, we have shared data of what a second dose looks like in terms of boosting, neutralizing antibody titers back up, both at one year, and we're also going to be looking at two years. And those--all of the data ourselves, as well as that booster-- similar booster data from the competitor products, will likely be brought together to inform the ACIP's recommendation of how they think RSC vaccines should be re-administered, when a booster might be necessary. It really falls to the committee to make that determination, not us.\nYour question was about whether we expect there to be any difference or distinction in terms of how they treat the vaccine. At this point, given the immunogenicity data and booster data that has been shared across all three products, which is remarkably consistent, as well as the consistent picture in terms of efficacy, including some waning efficacy for all products in a second year, we would suspect that they will continue to view the products as more similar than not and therefore continue with consistent recommendations, but it's really up to the committee to make that determination. At least from my perspective, I certainly think the science would support that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nElizabeth Webster\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for taking our questions. This is Elizabeth on for Salveen. Two questions from us. First, can you just remind us of where you stand with evaluating the RSV vaccine in the pediatric population?\nAnd then for the Phase III CMV vaccine, can you walk us through what you've seen on durability to date and how you're thinking about the durability of that vaccine, particularly as it relates to the potential commercial opportunity in a younger adult women/adolescent population? Thank you.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nYes. So I'll take the question. So on RSV pediatrics, we have not started the study yet. We are, of course, considering taking this into a Phase III. It is in the clinic with Phase I/II. We are waiting for the data to be able to move at the right time into the pediatric setting.\nIn terms of CMV, we don't yet have data yet on durability. Again, like we've done for other programs, when we share the data, we share the data, including durability, because it's very important. As you know, the benefit of young women is they have a very strong immune system. As we've shown in our INT programs, our T-cells work very well in terms of the vaccination technology of Moderna. So we really expect to have good durability over time. But again, we have to wait for the data to make such a determination. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nHi, this is Alex Hammond on for Geoff Meacham. Thank you for taking our question. So a great way to equalize vaccine efficacy results is to use a correlative of protection. So for RSV, when do you think we could have a light-- line of sight into this type of metric? And how important could this be for a competitive dynamics? Thank you.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGood morning. It's Stéphane, so...\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nSorry-- small technical snafu. So I'm back. I believe I caught the end of the question, which is, when do we think we'll have a correlate of protection that can inform dynamics, both between products and boosting? If that's correct.\nThe-- we and all the other manufacturers have been sharing publicly their-- our work on a correlate of protection. We do believe that we've identified a strong candidate in neutralizing antibodies, not surprisingly, from our clinical study. We've been sharing that data with regulators, and we've been sharing the preliminary analysis with public health officials, including advisory groups and ITAGs like the ACIP.\nWe will be publishing that data and ultimately submitting that to our regulatory submission as a correlate through this--the balance of this year. And if we, and I think the other competitors, are successful in establishing neutralizing antibodies against RSV as a correlate of protection in RSV, then it really will probably be the primary way that public health officials make determinations about revaccination and boosting, and ultimately how we maintain durable protection against RSV for high-risk populations like older adults.\nFrom a competitive dynamics perspective, once each product has established their correlate, their correlate will relate to them. But we do think there's probably going to be more commonality than not in the correlates of protection, which makes sense, because at the end of the day, we're still talking about the same virus and vaccination against it for all three products.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on your discussions with the FDA for 1010, your seasonal flu vaccine? And what's gating to filing here? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks. So we are speaking to the FDA and regulators around the world about what would be-- what they would like to see from a submission perspective for our first-generation of our influenza program, our mRNA 1010 program, as you referenced.\nI don't have any specific updates right now. We're in those conversations as we speak. I really don't want to get ahead of them. The kinds of things we're talking about are, what's the total submission data package? What's the duration of follow-up in some of these studie? And what additional studies or data might be supportive to the application? Those conversations are ongoing. We will provide updates as and when we have them, but I have nothing further to add right now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJessica Fye\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHi, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. For INT, can you talk about what's driving your confidence to go into metastatic settings? How's enrollment going in the Phase III melanoma trial? And I know you touched on manufacturing being important here. What's the status of that manufacturing scale-up work? And when is that facility going to be ready to go live?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat questions all. So, I'll take the first part of that. So, first on metastatic. So we have not formally decided or announced that we're going into a metastatic indication. We do have data from our Phase I study, our initial Phase I study in metastatic patients, including non-small cell lung cancer. But we have not yet made a determination that we're going into the metastatic indication.\nAnd I think, behind your question is a view that I would agree with, which is to the extent that INT is going to provide a really substantial benefit, we think it is probably in earlier lines of therapy. So not just adjuvant, but perhaps even Stage 1 disease or Stage 2 disease, depending on the indication, because the safety and tolerability profile is, we think, incredibly favorable, and the benefits we're seeing are pretty remarkable from an immune perspective.\nThat said, there is still a really high unmet need in the metastatic space. And, even immunotherapies like the PD-1s, like KEYTRUDA, provide a substantial benefit there. And so at the right time, we may, well, choose to study the metastatic indication, but as I said-- or metastatic indications and settings. But as I said, we have not yet formally decided to do that today. And we're really focused on adjuvant and earlier, and monotherapy principally. On the question on the manufacturing process and enrollment, we have substantially scaled up our ability to enroll patients in those Phase III studies. I can assure you that, with our partner, Merck, we wouldn't have opened a second Phase III study and be talking about the third, if we didn't have confidence in our ability to rapidly meet the demand for--the substantial demand from clinical research sites for INT manufacturing.\nWe haven't specifically put out numbers, but suffice to say, we are rapidly enrolling in those studies, and we would expect to make substantial progress this year and even perhaps getting close to completing enrollment in at least 1 of those studies if it continues the trajectory.\nSo, we're excited about the progress we've made in scaling up the manufacturing for clinical supply. We're excited about the progress we're making right now in enrolling patients and the demand that we're seeing from clinical sites. And we do believe that we've solved a lot of the-- for clinical research, for clinical development, the manufacturing requirements. The question then becomes commercial, and as we alluded to a few minutes ago, the Marlboro site would really become the purpose-built commercial site, which means to not only be able to deliver high-quality products at high volumes, but also do it at a valuable price and cost point.\nAnd all of that work is ongoing. We've made great progress in building that site. Our goal is to establish that site for at least clinical supply this year. But we haven't provided further guidance on when we will have that fully operational for potential commercial use. And ultimately, it depends upon discussions with regulators as well.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Moderna, Inc.\n\nKevin, we'll take our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Our last question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Wang",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks, guys. Two from me. First on RSV, I know there are some additional studies to expand the initial population. Can you comment on when we may see data from the Phase IIIs and 50-plus and the high-risk younger adults and when you could potentially supplement the filing if everything is positive?\nAnd then, you know, I know you commented on Australia. So just, as you were thinking about--or as you've talked about Australia as a proxy for COVID sales in 2023. Now, can you comment on how interpretable Australia will be for your RSV launch and as we look for trends in COVID vaccination rates? Thanks.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGreat. I'll quickly take the first part of that, and then hand it over to Stéphane for the second.\nSo the Additional data on 50-plus we have, obviously immunebridging data and co-administration data. We'll be sharing that at the appropriate time with public health officials and others. It could be as soon as the ACIP, it just depends on when the data comes in, as well as the 18-plus high-risk populations.\nIn your question about getting those in the label, it's important to note that public health officials can recommend use even beyond the label and may choose to do that. But our responsibility would be to get it in the label. And we will need to complete the initial BLA before then we could submit the SBLA to get that data in the label. And so, obviously, it would follow shortly after our hopefully successful PDUFA outcome in May.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephen. And on Australia, so a few things. First, I mean, our team has delivered a strong performance on COVID in Australia. We've been helping the government since the beginning of the pandemic, as you recall, we have announced a long-term 10-year partnership with the Australian government, and we are currently building a plant in Melbourne that is advancing quite successfully. And we are in active discussions with regulators around Australia for RSV approval.\nThe point I will make is that Australia, as you know, is a quite different market commercially to the U.S. It's really mostly driven by the government, so I will compare Australia more to a European market than to the U.S. market. I don't think we can draw any positive or negative correlation in terms of what happened in Australia, COVID or RSV, it's what will happen in the U.S. in the fall '24, winter '25. \nThank you so much for the questions today. Thank you for taking the time to be with us. We look forward to talking and seeing many of you in the coming days and weeks. I hope that you all have on March 27th, Annual Vaccine Day in your calendar. We will start the presentation at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. So have a great day, and thank you for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

And welcome to Moderna's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the formal remarks, we'll open the call up for your questions. To ask a question during the session, you need to press Star One One on your telephone. You'll then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdrawl your question, please press Star One One again. Please be advised, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna. Please proceed.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's third quarter 2023 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website. On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn it over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will start with a quick review of our business for third quarter. Arpa will then give you an update of our commercial progress and plans. Jamey will present our financial results and will explain in detail the one-time charges we announced this morning in our press release. Stephen will then review our clinical programs.\nAnd I will share our key priorities for 2024 and 2025 to return Moderna to sales growth and profitability. We delivered US$1.8 billion in Spikevax sales of COVID vaccine in the third quarter. Based on trend we are seeing in the U.S COVID market in recent weeks, we expect our sales for 2023 to be at least US$6 billion.\nWe have been preparing for the 2023 fall COVID launch throughout the year, because the U.S market was pivoting from a pandemic government purchase market to a commercial market. I am very pleased to report that according to IQVIA market data, we have a market share in the U.S of 45% season to date, compared to 36% for 2022. [inaudible] will show you, we even achieved 51% market share last week in the U.S.\nThis commercial performance in the U.S market shows that Moderna can compete commercially with large established players, that will prove important as we launch RSV 2024 and combo of flu-COVID in 2025. On the cost side of the company, we informed you at R&D Day that it was important for us to resize our manufacturing footprint, as the world has moved from a pandemic to an endemic setting.\nI am pleased that our manufacturing and finance team were able to move fast and resize our manufacturing, so that we can go back to 75% to 80% gross margin levels. This resizing resulted in a charge of US$1.6 billion, which Jamey will explain in detail in his section. Now let me turn over to Arpa to walk you through our progress in the U.S market.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Stéphane, and good morning or good afternoon to everyone. Today, I will provide an update on our third quarter performance, our U.S commercial launch progress and our preparation for our RSV launch next year. Our total sales in the third quarter came in at US$1.8 billion, which includes approximately US$800 million in international sales and US$900 million in U.S sales. Total sales for the first three quarters of the year were US$3.9 billion. Turning now to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook. In our international business, we expect an additional US$1.1 billion in sales. These sales are based on government contracts and once vaccine doses are shipped and accepted by the customer, they are not returnable.\nMore than half of these sales have already shipped in the fourth quarter. In the U.S, we expect at least US$1 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, which would bring U.S sales to approximately US$2 billion for the second half of 2023. This assumes approximately 50 million doses administered in the U.S, which would be similar to the fall season of 2022.\nWith US$3.9 billion in sales recorded as of the end of the third quarter, expected fourth quarter sales of US$1.1 billion internationally and at least US$1 billion in the U.S, our updated sales outlook for 2023 is at least US$6 billion. Now turning to the U.S launch. The data shown here are from IQVIA. As a reminder, IQVIA data only captures the retail channel in the U.S, which includes retail pharmacies and long-term care.\nI'm first going to share what our weekly market share trends look like and then discuss our cumulative share since launch and how it compares to last year. On the fifth week post launch, for the week ending October 20th, what you can see on the slide here is that Moderna's market share is 51%. As we look over the season to date, Moderna's cumulative market share for this season is now 45%, which is higher than the 36% market share we had in 2022.\nAs Stéphane mentioned, this progress demonstrates our ability to compete effectively in the commercial endemic market. Turning now to Slide 8, which shows cumulative vaccinations in the U.S retail pharmacy channel. This year, COVID vaccines were launched two weeks later than in 2022. As a result, we analyzed the data on a launch-adjusted basis, as shown in the graph on the slide.\nTo do this, we look at the data based on the number of weeks post launch, rather than simply on a calendar basis. This helps us compare vaccines uptake in 2023 versus 2022. On the graph, the blue line represents cumulative vaccinations post launch in '22 and the red line represents cumulative vaccination post launch this year. And on a launch-adjusted basis, the total market is tracking ahead of last year's vaccination levels, both on a weekly basis but also on a cumulative basis.\nAs a reminder, the retail channel is typically the largest segment, so these trends in the first five weeks are encouraging, given the later launch and slightly shorter season in 2023. Let's now turn to look at the channel mix in the market on Slide 9. In 2023, we expect retail and non-retail mix to evolve as the season progresses.\nThe non-retail segment includes independent networks, health systems, U.S government entities, clinics, and other providers. Last year, this non-retail segment made up approximately 16 million doses in the season, or 33% of the total market. The gray line on the graph charts CDC-reported vaccinations, which capture both retail and non-retail channels in 2022.\nThe blue line is vaccinations at retail pharmacies, as reported by IQVIA, in 2022. The difference between these two lines represents the non-retail segment. Looking at the data on the graph, you can see that the retail channel captures the majority of vaccinations early in the season. This can be seen in the narrow spread between the CDC and IQVIA data represented by the gray and blue lines, respectively.\nNow, if you look in the seventh week of launch in 2022, the current week that we are in, in '23, you can see that the slope of the non-retail channel is increasing. We know that distributors this year have recently increased shipments to the non-retail channel and, as such, we expect non-retail as a percentage of market to grow between now and year-end. Importantly, we expect our market share to be consistent across channels and higher in 2023 than in 2022.\nWe are committed to focus on public health efforts to increase vaccination rates. In the United States, we are taking a multi-pronged approach to educate all stakeholders and increase the urgency to get vaccinated. Across the medical community, pharmacies and clinics, and advocacy groups, we are providing patient education resources to help our partners encourage their patients to get their COVID vaccine this fall.\nEarlier this week, we also launched our branded direct-to-consumer campaign, both on TV, as well as across digital channels. For the remainder of the year, we will be amplifying education on the need for vaccination prior to gatherings, particularly with at-risk populations, such as families, and traveling during the holiday season. We are also launching a focused education effort for consumers who are infected with COVID this summer on the importance of getting vaccinated in November and December.\nTo summarize our COVID outlook, we expect at least US$6 billion of sales this year based on the U.S vaccination trends that signal a market of at least 50 million doses. Moderna's share, both in retail and non-retail, is expected to be consistent across channels and higher than in 2022.\nVaccine administrations in the retail channel are tracking ahead of last year on a launch-adjusted basis, signaling strong early consumer demand. Last year, only about 55% of COVID vaccinations were given by the end of October, with an additional 23 million vaccinations given in November and December. We expect the non-retail channel to increase as a percentage of the market, which will provide additional sites of vaccination for consumers to allow for a strong November and December. This year, given the later launch of vaccines, the non-retail channels are just now beginning their vaccination campaigns. To continue the momentum from our launch and supplement our customers' efforts, we will be amplifying our marketing campaigns in November and December.\nLet me now turn to the upcoming RSV launch in 2024. We believe we have a best-in-class product profile that can make a difference both to patients but also to our customers. Our clinical profile shows strong vaccine efficacy. We have a well-established safety and tolerability profile that leverages the same mRNA technology that has been delivered in over 1 billion COVID vaccines.\nAdditionally, we have not seen any cases of GBS in our phase III trials. An important differentiator for our customers is that we will be the only company with ready-to-use, pre-filled syringes, which are preferred by pharmacists and by clinicians. We continue to expect a 2024 launch of our RSV vaccine in the U.S, and are also preparing for launches in several international markets.\nWe're encouraged by the recent RSV launches in the market this year, beating expectations due to robust consumer awareness and demand. And we believe that we are well positioned for our launch in 2024. Our strong clinical profile and ready-to-use pre-filled syringes are key competitive differentiators. My team and I are particularly excited about our ready-to-use pre-filled syringes given the robust demand for our COVID pre-filled syringes this fall.\nThe majority of RSV vaccines in the U.S will be given in the pharmacy setting. And given the ongoing pharmacy labor shortages, our ready-to-use presentation will save time and also reduce administration errors. We will be the only company with a one-step administration compared to competitive products, which require multiple preparation steps by pharmacists and clinicians.\nWe are very excited for the launch of our RSV vaccine given the strong product profile. And the commercial team is well positioned to bring our RSV vaccine, our second respiratory vaccine, to market. I will now turn it over to Jamey to provide an update on our financials.\n\nJames Mock\n\nThanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone. Today, I will review our financial performance for the third quarter and provide an updated framework for our full year 2023 financial outlook. Additionally, given we know it's top of mind for investors, we wanted to provide our early thoughts on 2024 and how we're approaching the next couple years. Starting on Slide 15.\nTotal net product sales for the quarter were US$1.8 billion, down 44% year-over-year, driven by lower sales volume, and partially offset by a higher average selling price. Product sales were almost evenly distributed between the U.S market and the rest of the world. We initiated product shipments to customers in mid-September for the fall booster season, following the authorization of our updated COVID-19 vaccine.\nCost of sales for the third quarter of 2023 was US$2.2 billion compared to US$1.1 billion in the prior year. I will provide detailed commentary on the following slides. Research and development expenses were US$1.2 billion, which increased by 41% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by our expanded and maturing development pipeline with six products now in Phase III studies or pending approval.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were US$442 million, reflecting an increase of 59% year-over-year. The growth in spending was primarily driven by the buildout of our commercial activities and, in particular, our launch in the U.S commercial market. The income tax provision in Q3 was US$1.7 billion, as we reported evaluation allowance against deferred tax assets of US$1.7 billion.\nWhich restricts us to just our Covid vaccine and it does not include expected future launches. In combination with our updated and demick Covid forecast, we determined it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance did not impact cashflows, nor future returns northern company's ability to utilize deferred tax assets in future periods. Net loss for the period was $3.6 billion compared to net income with $1 billion last year.\nUnder GAAP accounting rules, we are required to take a reserve, also referred to as evaluation allowance, for deferred tax assets when the current year and cumulative income projection for the next three years is in a loss position. These losses indicate our deferred tax assets may not be fully realized. It's important to note, future income from products not yet approved by regulators are excluded from these income projections, which restricts us to adjust our COVID vaccine, and it does not include expected future launches.\nIn combination with our updated endemic COVID forecast, we determined it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance did not impact cash flows, nor future returns, nor the company's ability to utilize deferred tax assets in future periods.\nNet loss for the period was US$3.6 billion compared to net income of US$1 billion last year. Diluted loss per share was US$9.53 compared to diluted earnings per share of US$2.53 in 2022. Finally, we ended the third quarter with US$12.8 billion in cash and investments. The decline versus prior quarter was driven by our operating loss and sales to be collected in Q4. Now, let me come back to cost of sales on Slide 16.\nWe now expect full year cost of sales of US$5 billion, driven by US$1.5 billion of unit-driven expenses, which also includes royalties, and US$3.5 billion of inventory write-downs and charges related to CMO purchase commitments, cancellation fees, and wind-down costs. As Stéphane previously highlighted, in our pursuit to optimize the cost structure of our COVID-19 franchise, we undertook a strategic initiative in the third quarter to restructure our manufacturing footprint, which was built for the pandemic.\nAs part of this initiative, we reduced our capacity and commitments with several third-party vendors, we reevaluated our raw material inventory levels, and cut back on our purchase commitments for raw materials not anticipated to be consumed before expiration. As a result, we are recording charges of US$1.6 billion, US$1.4 billion of which are in Q3 and an expected US$0.2 billion in Q4.\nThe US$1.4 billion charge in Q3 consists of inventory write-downs of US$0.9 billion and CMO wind-down costs and cancellation fees of US$0.5 billion. The Q4 charge is related to CMO wind-down costs. Despite the immediate financial impact, we are confident that this strategic move will improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and establish a strong foundation for improved margins going forward.\nAs part of the US$1.6 billion in total restructuring charges I just mentioned, only the CMO-related costs and cancellation fees are cash restructuring costs. We project this approximately US$0.7 billion charge will have a payback in less than two years and a net cash benefit of approximately US$1 billion through 2029. As I mentioned, our full year forecast for cost of sales in 2023 is now US$5 billion. Before resizing charges of US$1.6 billion, our cost of sales for the full year is expected to be at the low end of our previous guidance of US$3.5 billion to US$4 billion.\nSo, now coming back to my commentary on Q3. In addition to unit-driven manufacturing costs and the cost from this initiative, we also incurred approximately US$0.4 billion of inventory charges for excess and obsolete material, demand-related write-downs of our latest Spikevax product, and unutilized manufacturing capacity charges.\nMoving to Slide 17. In summary, we made substantial progress to resize our COVID cost structure and accelerated our path towards our longer-term target of 20% to 25% of sales. We expect our cost of sales to not only be at a lower level, but also be more predictable in the future. In recent quarters, our cost of sales were highly impacted by write-offs and charges as we just addressed today and in previous calls. Year-to-date write-offs and charges for inventory CMO and supplier-related commitments are 74% of sales.\nStarting in 2024, we expect those to be less than 10% of sales on an annualized basis. Our capacity is now better positioned to scale with volume. At a US$4 billion sales level, we expect cost of sales of approximately 35%, reducing to approximately 30% at US$6 billion of sales, and 20% to 25% at even higher sales levels.\nIn other words, with our resized manufacturing footprint, we now expect to achieve significant volume leverage moving forward. Let's now move to Slide 18. While we intend to continue to focus on GAAP results, we wanted to give you a view of our financial results in Q3 with and without the resizing and tax valuation allowance charges. While our total GAAP net loss in the third quarter was US$3.6 billion, our loss excluding these charges would have been US$0.5 billion. Now, let's turn to our updated 2023 financial framework on Slide 19.\nAs Arpa mentioned earlier, we now expect product sales for 2023 of at least US$6 billion for the full year, which is comprised of US$3.9 billion of sales through the third quarter, an additional US$1.1 billion of international sales in Q4, and at least US$1 billion of Q4 sales from the U.S. As explained earlier, we now expect cost of sales for the full year of approximately US$5 billion, which includes resizing charges of US$1.6 billion.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we now expect full year expenses to be approximately US$6.3 billion, with approximately US$4.8 billion in research and development. Our R&D spend is slightly higher than the US$4.5 billion previously forecasted, which is mainly driven by business development activities as well as additional investments in our late-stage clinical trials. Our forecast for SG&A expenses remain consistent at approximately US$1.5 billion.\nWe now expect a full year tax expense of approximately US$0.8 billion to US$1 billion, driven by the US$1.7 billion increase in the deferred tax allowance I referenced earlier. And finally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately US$0.9 billion, down from our previous guidance of US$1 billion. Before I get into the specifics on 2024 and 2025, I wanted to share with you our principles on how we are operating the company today and our plans over the next three years.\nWe are laser-focused on making our COVID franchise profitable in 2024 and beyond. We look at our Spikevax product profitability, excluding research and development costs, for our future pipeline, and we believe our recent resizing efforts will ensure that our COVID franchise is a continuous and increasing source of income and cash generation. At the same time, we also recognize the significant and unique opportunity for organic sales growth ahead of us with our late-stage pipeline.\nWe will be disciplined in our investment approach and adjust R&D and SG&A, based upon the sales performance of our product lines, which in 2024 is still mostly COVID, but we expect it to also include RSV. We expect this investment in our late-stage pipeline will result in a loss over the next two years, but help us to breakeven starting in 2026.\nWe believe our current balance sheet is more than sufficient to fund our plans without the need to raise equity. We are also not planning to repurchase shares in the intermediate term. Stepping back, we believe this is an unparalleled opportunity to impact the lives of patients, while creating shareholder value at the same time.\nMoving to Slide 21, let's start with our view on sales over the next couple of years. We're expecting sales to hit a low point in 2024 at approximately US$4 billion. The biggest change year-over-year is related to our signed APAs. We currently have US$1 billion of COVID-related APAs for delivery in 2024. Recall that our first half sales in 2023 of US$2.1 billion were mostly deferrals from our 2022 existing contracts. So, we expect minimal sales in the first half of 2024.\nFor the U.S, we expect 2024 to be at least US$2 billion and believe it will grow over time. Lastly, we expect approximately US$1 billion from RSV and other international COVID sales. And finally, in 2025, we expect a return to growth. Let me finish by giving you a more fulsome view on 2024 and our thinking on 2025. Starting with 2024, as I just explained, we expect sales to be approximately US$4 billion.\nCost of sales are expected to be approximately 35% of sales. R&D expenses of approximately US$4.5 billion in 2024, would be down 6%. In 2024, the majority of our R&D expenses are for registration trials, which are now mostly committed. I will speak to our view on 2025 R&D expenses in a moment. SG&A expenses of approximately US$1.3 billion in 2024 would be down 13%.\nWe expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be similar to 2023 at US$0.9 billion. In summary for 2024, Spikevax will generate nearly US$1 billion of income. When we combine that with our estimated investments in R&D and capital expenditures, our cash balance is projected to be approximately US$9 billion at the end of 2024. Now for our preliminary thoughts on 2025.\nAs mentioned earlier, sales will return to growth. Cost of sales will improve with the increased sales growth. R&D will be flat to down, and we have much greater flexibility for reduction, given that only approximately half of our current R&D spending levels for registrational trials are committed for 2025. SG&A will be flat to down. Taxes will continue to be negligible.\nAnd capital expenditures will be materially lower after the completion of our facilities in the U.K, Canada and Australia in the first half of 2025. In summary, our COVID operating income will grow and our investments will remain flat or lower, leading us to an estimated ending cash balance of approximately US$6 billion to US$7 billion in 2025. Finally, during this period, we expect to launch five new products to help us breakeven in 2026. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nGood morning or good afternoon. Today I'll do a quick review of our clinical programs. Many of the details from these programs were shared at our R&D Day in September. I will also review the phase III trial designs for our combination flu and COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083 and the phase III trial design for our INT in non-small cell lung cancer.\nDuring R&D Day, we shared the significant progress we've made through the year in advancing our late-stage pipeline, creating the opportunity to have up to 15 product launches in the next five years. Through 2025, and subject to regulatory review and approvals, we anticipate launches for our RSV vaccine, our flu vaccine, a next-generation COVID vaccine, and our combination flu and COVID vaccine.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nLooking beyond 2025, we have a diverse pipeline of other vaccines, cancer therapies, and rare metabolic disease medicines. We're very excited by the potential benefits these medicines offer across a diverse range of therapeutic areas. Slide 25 is an overview of our respiratory vaccines pipeline. Our leading pipeline includes commercial and phase III programs against COVID, RSV, and flu, as well as earlier-stage next-generation programs in COVID and flu and multiple [inaudible].\nWe recently shared positive topline phase I II data from our combination flu and COVID vaccine, mRNA-1083. And on the heels of this success, we've started and are rapidly enrolling a phase III study for mRNA-1083 in adults 50 and older. Slide 26 shows the phase III design for mRNA-1083.\nThe phase III study is a randomized, stratified, observer-blind, active-control study evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of 1083 compared to co-administered flu and COVID vaccines. The study will enroll 8,000 participants overall, with two cohorts of 4,000 participants stratified by age 65 years and older and 50 to 64 years of age.\nBoth cohorts will receive mRNA-1083, or in the control arm, an age-recommended licensed quadrivalent flu vaccine plus our approved COVID vaccine. Study participants will be followed for six months. The next, on Slide 27, is an overview of our latent and other vaccines pipeline. As previously announced, our phase III study evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety of our CMV vaccine in women of childbearing age is now fully enrolled, including the adolescent cohort.\nThe study is accruing cases and we look forward to vaccine efficacy data when it becomes available. Earlier-stage clinical programs against EBV, HIV, VZV, HSV, and against the Norovirus and Lyme disease continue to progress. Slide 28 is an overview of our therapeutics pipeline. We're proud of the progress across cancer, rare diseases, and other areas. Many of the details of these programs were highlighted at our recent R&D Day, and I refer you to that presentation on our website. Notable since R&D Day is the continued rapid enrollment of the INT phase III adjuvant melanoma study, which has seen a great deal of interest from investigators and patients since presentation of the phase II data at ASCO earlier this year.\nAs previously announced, before the end of the year, we will conduct another analysis of the phase II study with longer follow-up time at approximately three years, and we are looking forward to sharing that data. INT is also moving forward in other types of cancer with the initiation of a second phase III study in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer.\nThe phase III design for adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer is shown on Slide 29. It is a randomized placebo-blind - double-blind placebo and active comparator controlled study of a combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA versus placebo plus KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The study will enroll approximately 900 patients with stage II to III-B tumors who were resected and previously treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.\nEach patient will receive up to nine doses of INT administered intramuscularly every three weeks with KEYTRUDA administered every six weeks in the active arm, or nine doses of a placebo injection administered every three weeks and KEYTRUDA every six weeks in the comparator arm. The primary endpoint of the study is disease-free survival.\nKey secondary endpoints include overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and patient-reported outcomes. This study marks an important milestone in our collaboration with our partner, Merck, and our shared commitment to rapidly bring INT to patients. With that, I'll turn it over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stephen, Jamey and Arpa. Our focus is to return Moderna to sales growth and profitability. To achieve that, we have three priorities. Priority number one, commercial execution. Our market share in the U.S demonstrates we can compete. We are focused on launching RSV in 2024. We believe we have best-in-class profile for RSV vaccine, high-efficiency, good safety profile, and the easiest to use in pharmacies or doctor's offices.\nAs you all know, pharmacy chains are having challenges given the workload, especially in the fall season. The two other vaccines on the market today are very complicated to prepare before injection; one is nine steps, and one is four steps. Now we launched pre-filled syringe and, as Arpa said, we are very excited about that.\nAnd from the discussions I had with the leadership of pharmacies, I believe that this will be an important differentiation. Our COVID plus flu combo vaccine should launch in 2025. And as you know, flu is a higher volume market than COVID. In the U.S, for example, flu is around 3 times the number of doses compared to the COVID market. With these new product launches in '24 and '25, and the combination of COVID sales in the endemic setting, we believe Moderna will be in sales growth again in 2025.\nPriority number two, discipline investments. We'll be disciplined in our investments and cycle them based on our sales performance. As you saw, we have taken bold actions to resize our manufacturing footprint in the third quarter. The team is not done and there are many continuous improvement projects to drive a reduction in cost of manufacturing.\nWe'll also look at our R&D costs and will consider partnering some programs, if needed, to allow us to be responsible and disciplined about our costs. For SG&A, as Jamey mentioned, we are currently going through our 2024 budget and our goal is to have a lower spend in SG&A in 2024 than we had in 2023. We still plan to keep SG&A flat in 2025 versus 2024. We're launching respiratory products in 2024 and 2025, and we anticipate the same teams [inaudible] productivity gains as we improve our commercial operations.\nAs Jamey mentioned, we expect to breakeven in 2026. Priority number three, executing on our late-stage pipeline to drive sales growth. As you all know, we have an exciting late-stage pipeline with six Phase 3 assets. For respiratory program, RSV, flu, next-gen COVID, mRNA-1283, and COVID plus flu combo that Stephen just talked about.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nOne latent program, CMV, which is fully enrolled in phase III and accruing cases. One oncology program, INT in melanoma, and as Stephen mentioned, in lung cancer. We look forward to having and sharing three years of INT data from our melanoma study before the end of this year. If the data are strong, we believe it could be the basis for regulatory discussions for potential accelerated approval.\nWe have been investing in building a factory in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will enable the commercial launch for INT. Thanks to the mRNA platform we built, we have an exciting pipeline, with up to 15 launches in the next five years. We have the largest late-stage pipeline of any mRNA company in the world and will continue to focus to deliver the greatest possible impact to people for mRNA medicine.\nI've never been more excited about the potential we have to deliver for patients. The actions we are taking help us to execute on that vision. With this, operator, we'll be happy to take questions now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen. If you have a question or a comment at this time, please press Star One One on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press Star One One again. We will pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you for taking my questions. I have two questions regarding the commercial questions. First, you did mention 2026, you’re looking to have a breakeven. And when we take a quick look based on your 2024 and 2025 outlook, it seems the total cost could be in the US$8 billion to US$9 billion, that range. Could you give us a sense what could be the additional sales if we’re using 2024 guidance as a base point? And the second very quickly regarding the manufacturing resizing. After resizing, what is the full capacity regarding doses and what percentage of the manufacturing will be internal in 2024 and 2025?\n\nJames Mock\n\nMaybe I’ll take the first one, first part of the question. So, in terms of 2026, Gena and thanks for the question, let’s talk to you about how we’re thinking about it. So, we mentioned US$4 billion in 2024, approximately US$4 billion. And this is all about our late-stage pipeline coming to fruition. So, in 2024, we’ll launch RSV, but it’s mostly kind of in the second half year sales, and then we’ll have a full year in 2025, so that’ll provide growth.\nWe will also come to market with flu in 2025. We’ll also come to market with a combination of flu and COVID in 2025. Again, depends on timing, but by 2026, we should have a full portfolio. So, we’re not going to say what the exact sales numbers are, but you mentioned US$8 billion to US$9 billion in costs.\nI’m not exactly sure where you’d get there unless you’re assuming a certain sales line on that, but let me go back to what we tried to lay out here. If you assume, for instance, US$6 billion in sales, we should have 30% of cost, or US$8 billion in sales, we should have 25% of cost. And then, we’ve said historically in our R&D Day that we need US$25 billion overall to make this investment, which should average US$5 billion a year.\nSo, hopefully, we’re giving you enough pieces without officially guiding any kind of numbers in 2026. But here’s what’s also important is, if those sales don’t come to fruition, we are telling you that we will adjust our expenditures in our investment. So, that’s — we hope that they will, we are confident in our pipeline, but should it not happen, then we were prepared to adjust our investment. I missed the second part of the question.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nCapacity.\n\nJames Mock\n\nGena, can you maybe repeat the second part of your question? I apologize. I missed it.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nSure. Basically, after manufacturing resizing, what is the full capacity regarding doses, and what percentage will be internal?\n\nJames Mock\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. As we try to lay out here and are showing you, this capacity is built for volume leverage. So, we at least put US$10 billion of sales on that page, and it will require no additional capacity. We will complete, of course, over the next year and a half the U.K facility, the Canada facility and Australia facility, but for the respiratory framework, we need no more, at least the US$10 billion. I won’t project beyond that, but that should answer that question. INT is a little bit different and we are building that and getting that ready for commercial purposes, but we’re built for volume leverage moving forward.\n\nGena Wang\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two from me here. One is, you provided guidance of about US$4 billion between COVID and RSV on the forward here for 2024. Could you just speak to the contribution from each and how you’re thinking about flu monotherapy? And the second question is that your financial framework for 2025 includes the ability to flex R&D and SG&A. Are there any parameters you can share on the range of this flexibility and how you would prioritize R&D programs and development? Thank you.\n\nJames Mock\n\nYeah, thanks, Salveen. I appreciate the question. So, on the US$4 billion, we’re not going to break out the US$1 billion that we attributed to RSV and COVID. All we can say is we’ve talked about our PDUFA date and that we filed in certain amount of countries across the globe. I will also say, as Arpa mentioned in her prepared remarks that we’re super confident in the product profile.\nWe are encouraged by the market and how it’s already started from an uptake perspective, and we think we will compete very well in 2024 and beyond. As it pertains to the flexing on our spending for 2025, obviously, I don’t know, 80% of our expenses or investments are in R&D, so US$4.5 billion for R&D and US$1.3 billion for S&A. So that, as I mentioned, 50% of the current spending levels is not committed.\nSo, we have time to make decisions and watch the market to be able to say what amount of registrational trials and what amount of R&D are we going to spend in 2025. So, hopefully that gives you a sense for how much is still the ability to flex. We also have other levers that we can pull, et cetera. SG&A, we also have some flexibility, probably not to the same magnitude, but there is still some amount of flexibility to bring that down from a variable expense perspective.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nAnd Salveen, this is Stéphane. Maybe just to add to Jamey’s point on the R&D, as I mentioned in my remarks, if we have to, we will be open, of course, to partnership some of those programs, which is an important way we could flex the R&D number based on where the sales are, as Jamey mentioned, which is if the sales are according to our plan, then we’re going to be okay. If the sales are below, we will be very open to partnering. As you know, we’ve done that in the past. The team knows how to do it. But we will be disciplined about our investments in the business based on where the sales line is.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, this is Sarah on for Ellie. Thanks so much for taking our question. First, I guess, can you talk about in 2024 again on that US$1 billion RSV international sales number? Are you expecting any contribution from flu in ’24, and maybe how you’re thinking about it into ’25? And then, on CMV, can you talk about where you are in cases and how they’re tracking versus R&D Day where I think you said a fourth of them were currently tracked? That would be great. Thanks so much.\n\nJames Mock\n\nSo, thanks, Sarah. I’ll take the first part and then hand it over to Stephen on CMV. So, there is no flu contribution in our 2024 sales outlook of approximately US$4 billion. So, in that US$1 billion, that is solely RSV and other COVID international sales. We do, as I mentioned in my — to answering Salveen’s question, we do expect to launch flu in our combination products sometime in 2025, and we’ll see what we’ve projected that time.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nAnd on the CMV question, thanks for that. So yes, we did update that we’re about a quarter of the way through the case accrual back in R&D Day. I think the next — we continue to accrue cases at a steady pace. I do think the next update will provide is likely our Vaccines Day in the spring.\n\nUnknown\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. I know GSK has provided an estimate in terms of size of the RSV market, about £5 billion, and Pfizer has given some metrics as well. Given what we’re seeing now with these early launches, can you provide us with your assessment of total market size here? And then given some of your comments on competing with larger companies, as you’re doing in COVID now, where ultimately do you see your market share shaking out in the RSV space? Thank you.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you for the question. In terms of the total RSV market, as I mentioned earlier, we’re excited by the uptake and the consumer awareness of the market overall. And our projections are similar to what both GSK and Pfizer have already guided. In terms of our market share with RSV, we have not yet provided or are ready to provide any forward-looking projections on share, but we are very excited about our strong product profile, both in terms of efficacy, safety, and, as I mentioned, our ready to use pre-filled syringes. So, we will be leveraging the learnings and the success from our COVID commercial launch this year and applying them to RSV next year.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nYes. Just to add to Arpa, Terence, it’s Stéphane, the point that Arpa and I made about the market share of COVID is what I think is very important. I think some people believe that because we’re a new company in commercials we’re not able to compete and I think the market share data that Arpa has shared really show that our U.S team is able to compete and we will continue to improve things that we are doing, because we are not done improving the [inaudible] culture as you know us. But the share already moving from 36% last year to 45% cumulative so far in the season, I think it’s already a demonstration of what the team is able to achieve. And the season is not over, so that’s 51%. So, let’s see where this one finish when the season is over.\nBut basically, the differences we have, as I mentioned, I’ve been speaking to pharmacist leadership. And they are all, I think, have a very big workload issue, as you know. There’s even strikes in some pharmacy chains in the U.S as we speak. And you think about the season there, [inaudible] business for the pharmacy for preparations, and then the flu, and then the COVID. And then, as I mentioned, those two other products, if you just download the label of those products from the FDA website and you look at how many steps they have, it’s very complicated.\nAnd when you talk to a pharmacy leadership, they don’t know how they’re going to deal with that type of workload. And so, coming with pre-filled syringe is a tremendous differentiator. We have very good efficacy. We have very good safety profile. We really believe that we have the best in-class product in the market. And [inaudible], it’s going to translate, I think, into a very good effect.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJessica Macomber Fye\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nHey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple coming back around to one that I think some others were trying to get at, but maybe a little differently. When we think about breakeven in 2026, what are you contemplating in that sales number embedded in your assumption? Does it reflect just respiratory vaccines? Or are you considering INT could be on the market then?\nAnd then second, I know you said the percentage of non-retail jobs would grow as the season progresses from where it has been so far this season. Do you believe that the proportion of COVID shots running through the retail channel has shifted at all, bigger picture in 2023 relative to 2022, or should we think of that proportion as remaining similar year-over-year? Thank you.\n\nJames Mock\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jess, for the question. Again, without getting into too much detail on 2026 in terms of how we think about it, I mean, the best way to keep going back to that late-stage pipeline that we’ve been talking to you about, RSV, flu, our combination, our next-gen COVID product as well, will all be very much there for the year 2026. And we are confident in all those product profiles and how we will compete.\nAs I mentioned, at 6%, our cost of sales — at US$6 billion, sorry, our cost of sales would be 30%. At US$8 billion, our cost of sales would be 25%. And of course, we’ll try to improve on that. And that will give us the envelope for how much we can continue to invest in the future products, which we said we’ll launch 15 by 2028.\nThat’ll be all of our latent product portfolio, that’ll be our INT portfolio, that’ll be our rare disease portfolio. So, I think that’s as much as we can say right now. I just want everybody to know that we are very committed to breaking even in that year, and we have a lot of flexibility, both from a growth standpoint and a discipline investment standpoint.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nGreat. And I can take the second question on the percentage of non-retail. So, as expected, in 2023, the retailers have been the majority of the market, with more than 90% of the volume during the first few weeks. However, we’re now beginning to see a shift towards more non-retail channels, as I had mentioned. We are seeing increased shipments to IDNs, to clinics, to pediatricians, as of the recent weeks. And as I think about full year 2023, I believe the retail mix will be stronger than in 2022 and could land at about 70% to 80% of total vaccinations, whereas in 2022, we saw that the retail channel was only about two-thirds of the mass.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nOh, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe circling back on the P&L, I appreciate all the effort on resizing manufacturing and the focus on gross margin, but how should we think about OpEx plus CapEx? As COVID numbers continue to come down, we’ve seen the BioNTech and Pfizer materially realigning OpEx plus CapEx to their top-line.\nI believe BioNTech lowered by US$600 million this year and Pfizer by US$1 billion this year and US$2.5 billion next year. However, your OpEx plus CapEx is not materially changed this year and you anticipate that the next year it’s going to be generally flat to down. So, can you just maybe comment on why you think that’s the right strategic decision for the organization? And then maybe second question on RSV.\nObviously, impressive initial launch by GSK and Pfizer and appreciate the differentiations of your product. But what’s the latest thinking on whether the vaccine is needed every year or less frequently than that? Is there a scenario where Pfizer and GSK penetrate the market pretty aggressively this year and then you face an uphill battle next year as it turns out that we need a vaccine maybe every other year and not every year? Any thoughts there much appreciated. Thanks so much.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nMaybe I’ll take the second part of that question and then hand it over to Jamey for the first. So, on RSV and the need for it, obviously, we’re continuing to follow the public health situation in terms of the rate of occurrence of the RSV epidemic this year. At this point, I think we don’t have data yet on whether or not it will ultimately be an annual or something less than annual, say every two or three year vaccination regime.\nI think like everybody else, we’ll be looking to our data, the other manufacturers’ data, as well as the public health, the epidemiologic data to guide that decision. There are plenty of vaccines for which there is an approach, flu as an example, where there’s a seasonal vaccination approach, both because of the benefit offered by the vaccine, but also because of the convenience of just making sure that every season, every year, people are reminded to get that vaccine.\nSo, the ultimate decision on whether this is going to be recommended is not ours, the manufacturer, it will fall to public health officials based on a number of factors, which will include the FDA and the data we provide, but other factors as well. And we’ll work to make sure they have the data they need to make that decision.\n\nJames Mock\n\nAnd I’ll take the first part. Thanks, Luca, for the question. I think the short answer is the opportunity set ahead of us, and we are acting. So, you referenced some of our competitors, so I just want to break that down. I mean, we are super encouraged by the opportunity for additional growth and our ability to impact patients. And we have this 15 products that we think will launch by 2028 or by 2025.\nWe think that’s the right thing to do. We have to grow out of our, we have to grow this company and to be able to afford the investment to be able to capture the unparalleled opportunity for this. And I think we are acting, I believe we are acting, and I mentioned everything that we’re doing from a cost of sales perspective.\nAnd so, I think that’s very much in line and sized appropriately to have volume leverage when it comes, because it will come. And we are saying in 2024, we can adjust both R&D and SG&A down to a good level, down 6% R&D, down 13%, so, on SG&A. We are largely committed to our registrational trials for 2024.\nBut as I mentioned, we don’t have as much flexibility in that particular year, but by 2025, we have even more flexibility. So we’re prepared to take action should we need to, but we’re very optimistic about the price line that’s coming. And hopefully this will just come through growth, and we’ll still be able to afford much of this investment.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director",
    "content2": "It’s Stéphane. Just maybe adding to Jamey, who said it super well. As you know, we have a platform company. And the public opinion success of those programs we feel very good about. If you just look at with COVID and phase III RSV — sorry, and phase III for RSV and phase III for flu, we have three out of three positive phase III. This is not your industry average.\nSo, we think we can create value and create return on capital for shareholders by investing that capital to high-priority projects that are in late-stage pipeline. As I said, we have the largest late-stage pipeline of any mRNA company. We have six programs right now. And as soon as we launch [inaudible], which is very, very soon, there’s going to be seven programs. We believe the best way to create returns for shareholders is to invest that capital to drive sales growth and profitability.\n\nLuca Issi\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Yee would draft for each of your line is open.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question. This is Dina on for Mike. I just wanted to get a sense of your assumptions for Q4 COVID jabs and what are you seeing in Q4 right now? How much of that is actually jabs and actual injections versus channel fill? And just to follow-up on that. Now that you’ve seen sort of half of the 2023 fall season play out, what are your assumptions for 2024 and 2025 for COVID? Are you essentially assuming that the same people who got vaccinated this year will continue to get COVID vaccine every year? Thanks so much.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you for the question. In terms of the fourth quarter ’23 jabs, what we saw in 2022 is there was a significant portion, about 45% of the total COVID vaccinations happening in November and December. This year, we’re expecting a similar split, likely larger, given that we launched two weeks later into the season in 2023 than we did last year.\nAnd what we are hearing from our different non-retail customers, as well as our retail pharmacy partners, is they are planning vaccination campaigns and marketing efforts to really capture on the November and December months. So, in total, we do anticipate getting to at least 50 million doses this year, and we do believe that November and December will be strong months for us.\nIn terms of 2024, our assumption is everyone who has gotten their booster in 2023 will at least get their booster also in 2024 and beyond. Now, given the higher burden of disease with COVID, as consumers become more understanding of the annual recommendations and as the convenience of getting both flu and COVID becomes more normalized, we do believe over time we’ll start to see some increase in the overall COVID market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nHartaj Singh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you for my question. I just got a question on the combination programs. And just to give a little bit of - frame the question, in other therapeutic areas, aside from vaccines for infectious diseases, for example, oncology, monotherapy treatments generally tend to be minority of treatments, 10%, 15%, 20%. Currently, monotherapy vaccines dominate the market in COVID-19 flu.\nSo, when you get the combination vaccines going, do you imagine - does your market research tend to suggest that you would, again, probably a combination approach might dominate that versus a monotherapy approach, singular vaccines going forward? And then secondly, will the cost of goods sold be any different for the combination versus the monotherapy products? Thank you.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nGreat. Thank you for the question. So, we do anticipate that our combination vaccine will take a substantial share of the monotherapy vaccines that are available. We have seen in the pediatric vaccine market that upon availability of combinations, you see very strong uptake and conversion from monos to combinations, and we expect a similar trend in the adult market. From our market research, we have heard consistently from consumers that they prefer one shot over multiple shots.\nFrom a customer perspective, we are hearing, as Stéphane had mentioned, just with workload issues, one shot saves a lot of time and also helps them to get more patients protective. And from a broader healthcare system and government and payer perspective, we are hearing an increased need to help get greater uptake and compliance in adult vaccinations.\nAnd our healthcare authorities believe that combinations can help actually boost the vaccination rate. So, we are very excited about our combination products in the future and think this could really be an inflection point for our mandatory vaccines.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nYes, it’s Stéphane. Just to add to Arpa’s comments, during COVID, we’ve been discussing to a lot of - with healthcare ministers, and the topic of vaccination combination has come a lot. And as you think, especially outside the U.S, where you have a lot of [inaudible] taking care of people from birth to death, basically, we are very, very interested in combinations. Because they know that if a participant of a country got the vaccine, they got protection against several viruses, which prevent hospitalization.\nAs you know, we’ve done partnership with some countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia. And through those negotiations, the concept of combination was critical in their decision-making. Because as they see their population getting older, they worry that the number of hospitalizations will just go up over time and the ability to prevent that when you see shortages of healthcare workers and as you project those shortages in the future is a key determination of a decision.\nSo, I only think in integrated healthcare system, the drive the [inaudible] will move even faster than actually in commercial markets like the U.S market.\n\nJames Mock\n\nAnd, Hartaj, maybe I’ll take the cost of sales question. Thank you for it. So, this provides a substantial margin expansion opportunity. So, if you think about it, our cost of sales, the smallest portion is our drug substance, so it’s our actual mMRA, and that’s a very small portion of our overall cost of sales. Everything from drug product in terms of the cost to finish the product and the presentation type, whether it’s PFS or a vial or whatever, that now gets cut in half. So, when we sell two, it’s a very limited amount of cost increase versus a single presentation. So, it does provide a significant margin expansion opportunity. So, thank you for the question.\n\nHa\n\nThank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Wang\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking the question. Appreciate you guys sharing early thoughts on ’24 and beyond. For ’24 specifically, you talked about some of the contribution from COVID and RSV in terms of split. It sounds like you plan to hit the ground running there in RSV. With international, how are you thinking about the longer-term contribution from COVID as competitor agreements expire? And with flu, with the comments on marketing in ’25, wondering if you’ve had any recent conversations with the regulators there, in terms of potential approval. Thanks.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\n[inaudible]. Thank you for the question. In terms of our expectations in 2024, we have put about US$1 billion across international COVID and RSV. We do anticipate a strong launch in the second half of the year with RSV. And on the international side for COVID, we are continuing to pursue multiple options across a number of countries. In Japan, we will be in a fully commercial market, is our expectation, where we will be competing for the Japanese business.\nIn the EU, we continue to work with countries on agreements to secure our COVID-19 vaccine. As publicly disclosed, the EU has renegotiated their contract with Pfizer earlier this year. So, the EU demand has been substantially satisfied in many markets, but we are hearing from individual member states that they are looking for a second supplier for vaccines.  And we are in those discussions right now, both at a country level, but also at a European Commission level to see if a joint procurement agreement can be established in 2024.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nAnd thank you for the flu question. So, as you referenced, we had really strong data out of our P303 phase III study for flu that we released at R&D Day. We’re excited about that. We are engaging right now with multiple regulators about the pathway to licensure. I don’t have an update about all those conversations because they’re happening as we speak, but we will, once we have clarity across all markets on the pathway licensure, provide an update.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today’s conference — end of the call itself. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

Welcome to Moderna's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's Second Quarter 2023 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning, or good afternoon. Today, I will start with a business review of our second quarter. Stephen will then review our clinical programs before Arpa gives an update on our commercial progress and plans. Jamey will present our financial results, and I will come back to share some final thoughts.\nIn Q2, we reported revenues of approximately $300 million, reflecting the seasonal nature of endemic respiratory vaccines. Given our investments in our 4 infectious disease vaccine programs, which are in Phase III and our oncology program also in Phase III, this off-season quarter sales resulted in a GAAP net loss of $1.4 billion, GAAP diluted loss per share of $3.62. We ended the quarter with a cash and investment balance of $14.6 billion.\nWe continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, prioritizing organic growth of our platform with investments in our business. In Q2, we invested $1.1 billion in R&D, continuing investments in late-stage clinical programs and progressing our pipeline. SG&A costs were approximately $300 million. Capital investments were approximately $200 million.\nYear-to-date, our external investments were all strategic collaborations with the exception of OriCiro in Japan, which was an acquisition. OriCiro was renamed Moderna Enzymatics and is being integrated into Moderna manufacturing process development organization.\nFrom a capital return perspective, we repurchased 4.4 million shares in Q2 for a total of $628 million.\nNow turning to commercial and late-stage clinical updates in the quarter. With the submission of our XBB updated COVID-19 vaccine applications to regulators globally, we are now awaiting approval to start fall of 2023 sales. As you will hear from Arpa shortly, we're updating for COVID-19 sales expectation for 2023 to a range between $6 billion and $8 billion. This range reflects additional contracts in the U.S. commercial market and other countries. This range is wide given the uncertainty on the U.S. vaccination rate.\nOur commercial team is also preparing for the 2024 launch of RSV, our next respiratory commercial product. Regulatory applications have been submitted in major markets around the world. We've also started to manufacture mRNA-1345 in preparation for the launch. As a reminder, at launch, this product will be in a pre-filled syringe presentation, which combined with a strong efficacy profile, we position very well on product to health care professionals.\nIn oncology, for mRNA-4157, or Individualized Neoantigen Therapy or INT, we are continuing to scale up manufacturing to support clinical development and commercial markets. We are very pleased to report our Phase III study in adjuvant melanoma has begun enrolling patients in July.\nWe will plan, on Slide 6, our updated company profile. The breadth of our late-stage pipeline means we could see multiple launches in '24, '25 and '26.\nTurning now to Slide 7. I am proud to share that Moderna has been named as one of the world's most innovative companies in 2023 for pioneering AI-driven innovation by the Boston Consulting Group. As many of you know, AI has been part of the foundation of Moderna's research and development programs for several years. We have built our own AI models for protein and mRNA engineering, data analysis, regulatory interactions and many more other use cases.\nAs we continue to be an AI leader in biopharma, one of our key modular mindset is that we digitize everything possible as we recognize that this will be central to the impact we have with AI. As of 2023, AI training is required for all Moderna's team members and will facilitate this training at the corporate level through our AI Academy. We have challenged everyone across all of our business functions at Moderna to incorporate AI into their everyday's workflow.\nI'm happy to share our AI implementation is accelerating throughout Moderna. Our secure large language model is called mChat. As you can see on the graph, our mChat usage has grown rapidly amongst our employees since its introduction on May 18. Around 50% of our employees use it already only 60 days after launch.\nWith that, I will now toss to Stephen for an update on development programs.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Stéphane. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress of our key clinical programs in Moderna, and I'll start with our respiratory vaccines.\nOn the left-hand side of the slide, we have our commercial and late-stage clinical pipeline program against 3 important respiratory viruses, COVID-19, flu and RSV. I'll share some updates on these programs in a moment. Our next-generation programs have made substantial progress over the first half of this year, including mRNA-1283, which is enrolling participants in a Phase III study and our next-generation influenza vaccines, which are both in Phase II. We currently have 6 combination vaccine programs addressing adult and pediatric populations. Our combination vaccines are designed to address the largest health care burdens caused by respiratory infections while providing multiple advantages such as increasing compliance and reducing administration costs.\nTurning to our COVID program. We have submitted our applications for approval and authorization of mRNA-1273.815, our updated monovalent COVID-19 vaccine targeting the XBB.1.5 variant. Recall that the June VRBPAC meeting, the committee recommended an XBB-targeted monovalent vaccine with a preference for the XBB.1.5 strain. This recommendation was adopted by the FDA and is in concordance with the EMA and WHO guidance. In the U.S., the CDC ACIP is expected to publish recommendations and guidelines for the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines following approval and authorization this fall.\nOn Slide 11 are the clinical data our team presented during the June VRBPAC meeting. Data from a subset of our Phase II/III study with mRNA-1273.815 demonstrated potent neutralization against XBB.1.5 and other variants of the XBB lineage. We're proud that Moderna was the only company that presented clinical data with an XBB.1.5 candidate in advance of the season, which we believe may help uptake of this important vaccine.\nMoving to RSV. As Stéphane mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be on track for regulatory approvals in 2024. Earlier this month, we announced a rolling submission to the FDA, and we plan to use a priority voucher to accelerate that review. We also filed additional regulatory applications in Europe, Switzerland, Australia and the U.K. We're incredibly encouraged by the profile of mRNA-1345 and look forward to the expected commercial launch next year.\nNext, on the seasonal influenza program. I'm pleased to announce that our P303 study is fully enrolled, and we look forward to sharing an update this quarter. P303 is testing an update to mRNA-1010 that is designed to increase the HAI neutralizing titers against the B antigens. This is a safety and immunogenicity Phase III study that we believe will support accelerated approval of the updated mRNA-1010 candidate.\nNow turning to our latent vaccines on Slide 14. Our Phase III CMV vaccine study in women of child-bearing age is ongoing and I'm pleased to share that the trial has enrolled more than 80% of participants. We look forward to full enrollment of that study soon.\nIn our early clinical programs, EBV, HIV and VZV vaccine trials are ongoing and our HSV program is in pre-clinical.\nNow let's look at our mRNA therapeutics portfolio on the next slide, and I'll highlight a few programs. We are excited to announce that our Phase III melanoma study with INT is now enrolling. And I'll share the Phase III design in a moment. Our rare disease programs addressing major unmet medical needs in propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia and GSD1a are ongoing, and we will look forward to sharing updates when the data are mature.\nIndeed, during the quarter, we presented an update on some of our PA program data at ASGCT. The dose confirmation part of the propionic acidemia study is currently ongoing. And lastly, our collaborators at Vertex are continuing to enroll in dose cystic fibrosis patients in the single ascending dose portion of that Phase I study.\nNow on my last slide today, I want to take a moment to share the exciting Phase III trial design for our Individualized Neoantigen Therapy, or INT. This Phase III study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of the combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA against placebo plus KEYTRUDA in patients with resected melanoma at high risk of recurrence. The study will enroll approximately 1,089 resected melanoma patients, Stage IIB through IV with a 1:1 randomization. Each patient will receive up to 9 doses of INT every 3 weeks and KEYTRUDA every 6 weeks in the active arm or 9 doses of placebo every 3 weeks and KEYTRUDA every 6 weeks in the comparator arm. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoints include Distant Metastasis-Free Survival and Overall Survival.\nI'm incredibly impressed with the collaboration between the Moderna and Merck scientific and clinical teams to rapidly stand up and begin enrolling this Phase III study.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Arpa.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good day to everyone. I'll start with a review of sales in the quarter and the first half of 2023.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we reported approximately $300 million of COVID vaccine sales, which was in line with our expectations given the seasonal nature of endemic respiratory vaccine businesses. Sales of $2.1 billion for the first half of 2023 met our expectations. As a reminder, the sales in the first half were predominantly from mRNA-1273.222, which is our COVID vaccine targeting the BA.4, BA.5 variant. As you heard earlier from Stephen, regulators and health authorities around the world have selected the XBB.1.5 variant for the fall 2023 season. We have submitted applications to regulators globally for our updated vaccine and we are now awaiting approvals and authorizations. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect additional sales in the second half of 2023, primarily from mRNA-1273.815.\nTurning now to the 2023 COVID sales outlook. We are updating our COVID sales expectation for 2023 to be in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion with the key variable being vaccination rates from the United States. Our 2023 sales mix consists of $2.1 billion in sales already recorded in the first half of this year, another $2 billion in sales from previously signed advanced purchase agreements for the second half delivery from several countries, including those listed in the middle column on this slide.\nRecent discussions with customers around the world have resulted in confirmed contracts of $2 billion for delivery in the second half of this year, updated from the originally expected $3 billion. Approximately $1 billion of the original $3 billion are now expected to be deferred to 2024. Also now included in the total expected 2023 COVID sales range of $6 billion to $8 billion is an additional $2 billion to $4 billion in sales expected from signed and anticipated commercial contracts in the U.S. as well as other markets such as Japan and the EU. The U.S. commercial contracts are a sizable portion of additional new sales expected in the second half of this year, so let me provide some color on that market in particular.\nAs you are aware, the COVID vaccine market in the U.S. has shifted to a commercial market with the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase. In the U.S., the commercial vaccines market is made up of many different customer segments, including retail pharmacies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks, health systems, government entities, employers and other providers. Today, I am happy to report that we have signed contracts in each of these customer segments and continue to work on additional contracts. We are ready with ample supply to be shipped upon regulatory approval.\nOur science contracts give us visibility into the expected U.S. launch in the coming weeks and confidence in the additional sales we expect in the second half of 2023 from new orders.\nLet me now turn to Slide 21 to help frame the fall of 2023 U.S. COVID market. As I mentioned earlier, a key determinant for the market size in the U.S. will be vaccine uptake or shots and arms during the upcoming September to December time frame. As I've mentioned before, our expected 2023 sales range of $6 billion to $8 billion will be primarily driven by vaccination rates in the U.S. market. Earlier in the year, we provided parameters that informed our U.S. fall volume forecast for 2023, which included the roughly 50 million doses administered in the U.S. in the fall of 2022, 82 million Americans in the high-risk category for those who are over 50 with a comorbidity or those over the age of 65 and an average of 150 million doses of flu vaccines given in the U.S. every year for the last 9 years, which we believe is a reasonable proxy for a seasonal respiratory vaccine especially given the higher burden of disease with COVID.\nThese parameters supported a volume forecast of 100 million doses for the U.S. market for fall 2023, but the fact of the matter is, in this first transition year to a commercial endemic market, it is difficult to accurately predict market volumes and predict how many Americans will come in this fall for their shots. As such, we look to Southern Hemisphere countries where the COVID season occurs during their fall/winter months to inform potential vaccination uptake in the U.S. as well. Specifically in Australia, where they are just completing their 2023 COVID season, the vaccination rate was 19% and populations where the booster vaccine was recommended. The Australian data, combined with prior year comparisons indicate U.S. market volumes for fall of 2023 to be in the range of 50 million to 100 million doses and this supports our U.S. sales expectations for the second half of the year.\nMoving to Slide 22. I'm excited to share the fall vaccination campaigns for the updated COVID vaccine launch. Moderna's fall vaccine campaigns are two-pronged and are focused on: first, increasing the market size through disease awareness programs and secondly, on solidifying Moderna's market share with branded promotion. With our disease awareness campaigns, we are aiming to educate on disease burden, clarify the latest recommendations from ACIP and connect COVID-19 with seasonal flu vaccines with the goal to drive consumers to get vaccinated this fall. Branded promotion campaigns will focus on driving brand preference from Moderna's vaccine running direct-to-consumer campaigns across major media channels and conducting promotions with health care providers. The commercial team is highly energized for the launch of the updated COVID vaccine.\nMoving on to Slide 23. We are continuing to prepare for a potential 2024 launch of our RSV vaccine and are excited about the opportunity in front of us. We believe our vaccine has the best-in-class profile. This includes consistent high efficacy across vulnerable and older populations, as shown in the strong clinical data that we have shared. Additionally, our safety profile is well established. We now have administered more than 1 billion COVID vaccine doses using the same mRNA technology as our RSV vaccine.\nIn our Phase III study, most solicited adverse events were mild to moderate. An mRNA-1345 in our Phase III RSV trial has not had any reported cases of GBS events as of the April 30 cutoff date. And finally, one important differentiator for us and for our customers at launch will be the presentation of the product, which will be exclusively in ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. This packaging allows health care professionals to conveniently dose consumers with a ready-to-use formulation. We believe this will save time and reduce errors in comparison to the reconstituted drug products on the market.\nWe continue to invest in pre-launch activities and are prepared for next year's potential launch. Our commercial team is active globally, and our manufacturing organization is well prepared to deliver the vaccine.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jamey.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone. This morning, I will cover our second quarter financial performance and provide a framework for our full year financial outlook. Starting on Slide 25.\nTotal product sales were $293 million, down 94% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales volume. We continue to expect 2023 to be a transitional year as we move from a pandemic to an endemic commercial market with significant seasonality. In line with our expectations, sales in the second quarter were relatively low, while we came in at the high end of our communicated range. Cost of sales for the second quarter of 2023 was $731 million.\nIn addition to unit-driven manufacturing costs, this includes the following charges: $464 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 product, unutilized manufacturing capacity of $135 million and losses on firm purchase commitments of $75 million. These charges, other than royalties, were primarily driven by a shift in product demand to our latest monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate and an overall lower market size compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nIn order to have ample supply at the beginning of the 2023 fall season, we prepared for various outcomes of the strain selection resulting in additional cost to the P&L. The fact that a monovalent was chosen also meant that we were not able to use previously manufactured semi-finished goods.\nR&D expenses were $1.1 billion, which increased by 62% versus prior year. The increase in R&D continued to be driven by clinical trial-related expenses, particularly with our Phase III studies for RSV, seasonal flu and CMB. The increase in R&D is also attributable to increases in personnel costs due to increased head count to support our research and late-stage development efforts.\nSG&A expenses were $332 million, reflecting an increase of 57% year-over-year. The growth in spending was primarily driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of our digital initiatives, marketed products, related commercialization activities as well as our company expansion.\nIncome tax was a benefit of $369 million for the second quarter, mainly due to a loss from operations. Net loss for the period was $1.4 billion compared to net income of $2.2 billion last year and diluted loss per share was $3.62 compared to diluted earnings per share of $5.24 in 2022.\nWe ended Q2 with cash and investments of $14.6 billion compared to $16.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decrease was driven by our net loss in the period and an approximately $600 million of share buybacks. Cash deposits for future product supply declined during the quarter by approximately $100 million to $1.7 billion by the end of the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations.\nNow turning to Slide 27. I want to give an update on the progress we have made on our capital allocation priorities. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business. R&D spending in the first half of 2023 increased 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, and we remain on track to invest $4.5 billion in R&D for the full year. We are also investing in our digital capabilities, the commercial build-out of the organization as well as expanding our manufacturing footprint. We've accelerated our capital expenditures in 2023 as we expand both our international and U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investments and collaboration opportunities that will enable and complement our platform. We remain disciplined in our approach and are in multiple active discussions.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. In the first half of 2023, we repurchased 8 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion and we had $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining as of June 30, 2023.\nNow let's turn to our updated 2023 financial framework on Slide 28. We would like to share our thinking beyond the advanced purchase agreements. As Arpa mentioned earlier, we now expect product sales for 2023 in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion comprising of approximately $4 billion from existing APAs and approximately $2 billion to $4 billion from additional sales to the U.S., Japan, EU and other countries. As a result of recent discussions with customers around the world, we now expect approximately $1 billion of the original total $5 billion in APAs to be deferred to 2024.\nSecond half sales timing will be dependent on timing of regulatory approvals across the world, and the number of days available in the third quarter to ship. We currently expect a sales split of 30% in Q3 and 70% in Q4.\nWe now expect cost of sales for the full year in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. At this point of the year, our production costs are largely fixed and only a smaller portion is driven by the sales outcome. Therefore, we thought it would be more helpful to provide you an absolute dollar range for your modeling purposes.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $6 billion, with approximately $4.5 billion in research and development. We now anticipate a full year tax benefit in the range of $0.7 billion to $1 billion, driven by an assumed operating loss, R&D credits, international provisions and nonrecurring items. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jamey, Arpa and Stephen.\nModerna has a promising commercial outlook, starting with COVID. While there is uncertainty in vaccination rates as we transition from a pandemic to endemic market, our APAs and U.S. commercial contracts underpin our expected 2023 COVID revenue in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. We believe this first endemic here will provide visibility to recurring revenue stream. I believe we will be selling COVID vaccines for a very long time and we are working to combine COVID and flu into a single vaccine.\nMoving to RSV. RSV vaccine has a strong product profile and a differentiated pre-filled syringe presentation that should work through our advantage in the anticipated 2024 launch. In oncology, we are scaling our IoT manufacturing capacity to be ready for commercialization. The Phase II data are very strong, and we are now in Phase III with melanoma indication.\nWith our partner, Merck, we are working to prioritize indications beyond those already announced, which are melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\nStepping back and looking at the broad portfolio, I'm very excited that we are playing with a high-case scenario of Moderna with positive clinical data in infectious disease vaccine, in oncology, and in rare genetic disease of liver. Over the next 3 years, from '24, '25, '26, we anticipate multiple product launches across our vaccine and therapeutics portfolio that will position the company for strong sales growth. This is an incredibly exciting time at Moderna as we enter a new era with diversified revenue stream and a robust pipeline.\nThe platform is working, and the result will be an unprecedented number of mRNA launches in a very short time.\nWe look forward to updating you further at our upcoming R&D Day on September 13. That event will be live in New York City and, of course, also available online. On December 7, we'll be hosting our second annual ESG Day. This event will be online. The mission of our company is to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through MRNA medicines. This mission is especially relevant now as we approach the launch of multiple new medicines that should extend human lives and alleviate patient suffering. All of our stakeholders are poised to benefit as Moderna continues to deliver on its potential. It is a privilege for all of us to be part of this company.\nWe'll now take questions. Operator?",

Welcome to Moderna's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar. Please go ahead.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's First Quarter 2023 Financial Results and Business Update. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors Section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stephane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamie Mock, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will start with a business review Stephen will then review our clinical programs before Arpa gives an update on our commercial progress and plans. Jamie will present our financial results, and I will come back to close.\nSo in the first quarter, we recorded revenues of $1.9 billion, GAAP net income of $79 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.19. Cash and cash investments of 16.4 billion at the end of the quarter. We continued in Q1, executing on our capital allocation strategy, prioritizing investments in our business. In the third quarter, we invested $1.1 billion in R&D, continuing investment in last stage clinical programs and progressing our entire pipeline.\nSG&A costs were approximately $400 million in the quarter, which include investments in digital and also AI infrastructure and approximately $100 million in capital investments. In 2023, our [indiscernible] team has been very active. This includes the acquisition of OriCiro in Japan, collaboration with CytomX, Life Edit and Generation Bio. All of these investment opportunities further expand the reach of Moderna's mRNA technology.\nWe are growing Moderna and [indiscernible] operating system. Probably less than $6 million were returned to shareholders with share purchase of 3.6 million shares in the quarter. Let me turn to Commercial in the first quarter.\nWe continue to expect $5 billion in COVID vaccine deliveries in 2023 from already signed advanced purchase agreements. With $1.8 billion of COVID we are well on our way to achieve $5 billion in APS. The commercial team is actively negotiating to sign new contracts with customers in major markets to finalize additional orders that will add to the $5 billion. The U.S. team is negotiating with pharmacy chains, hospital networks and other customers.\nAs a reminder, the $5 billion of [indiscernible] does not include any -- 2023 U.S. contracts. So these new U.S. commercial contracts are important to the business as the additional. The team is also making progress in Japan, in Europe and other countries in Asia, Middle East and also Latin America. We recently signed a new contract in Australia for 2023.\nOur commercial organization is also preparing for the launch of RSV in 2024. Our next respiratory commercial products. They're educating the medical community on the health burden of RSV. Our medical team is participating in major infectious disease medical congresses and sharing the new data that shows a strong profile of our [ RSV vaccine ]. To prepare for our RSV vaccine launch, our manufacturing team has already begun producing drug substance, the mRNA molecule for RSV vaccine. The vaccine will be supplied as a prefilled syringe. We believe that will help drive adoption by pharmacists and doctors versus some of our RSV products.\nIn oncology, for mRNA-4157 now called individualized neoantigen therapy, or INT, we are scaling up manufacturing to support clinical development and commercial markets. Our commercial team is also working to prioritize tumor types to select for adjuvant Phase III studies in addition to melanoma and lung.\nTurning to the pipeline. At Vaccine Day, we discuss detailed data from our RSV vaccine that were presented at [indiscernible] medical meetings. We believe the profile of RSV vaccine is potentially best-in-class. We shared top line data on the 2 programs announcing the initiation of Phase II or III, the Phase III study that we intend to use for accelerated approval as well as strategy for our next-generation [indiscernible] programs. We also announced the start of Phase III for next-gen COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283, which should be refrigerator-stable.\nToday, we're also announcing a new program for pandemic readiness for [ Influenza H5 ]. In latent vaccine, our CMV Phase III trial continued progress and is greater than 50% enrolled. I'm also very pleased to announce progress in our early-stage program, EBV and HIV.\nEBV, as you know, has 2 programs. The EBV Phase I trials to prevent mononucleosis with mRNA-1189 are fully enrolled in adults and also in adolescents. Our EBV trial for the treatment of long-term complication for EBV infection has now started enrolling. And for HIV, we shall interim analysis from our Phase I study at vaccine.\nWe also introduced new programs. We are working on vaccines for Norovirus and Lyme Disease. Lyme is the first bacterial pathogen we are targeting with our [indiscernible] vaccine. In [indiscernible], we participated in ASCR making where we presented detailed Phase II data from our [ R&D ] program partnered with Merck. Later on the call, Stephen will take you through the data presented there.\nAlready this pipeline is also making progress. We're excited to announce a new milestone for our [indiscernible] program. The Phase I/II trial in Propionic acidemia, [indiscernible], is now in dose expansion phase. And additional data from this study will be presented at the American Society for Gene and Cell Therapy later this month in May.\nThe company continues to expand at a rapid pace. We have 47 programs underway which now reflects the inclusion of new program also in the quarter and removes programs that are not continuing to develop. The full of -- pipeline can be seen in the appendix of this presentation or obviously on our website. We now have more than 4,000 team members and 17 commercial subsidiaries across Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nIn addition to our commercial subsidiaries, we also announced we're opening a Seattle office as a technology hub, where we're hiring the data scientists and engineers who will help digitize our business and expand our AI capabilities. I'm also happy to announce Modena was officially recognized in March has a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute. Our $16.4 billion of cash at the other quarter is enabling us to scale across our research, development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A.\nWith that introduction, let me now turn to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident\n\nThank you, Stephane. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the clinical progress in R&D at Moderna in the first quarter and highlight select data from the past few months has been presented. The core of our respiratory portfolio is made up of vaccines against COVID-19, flu and RSV, which are either commercial or in Phase III. We're advancing second-generation vaccines, this includes our second-generation refrigerator stable COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1283, which is rapidly enrolling in its Phase III study and 2 next-generation influenza vaccines that are in Phase II. We believe combination vaccines will be the future of our respiratory franchise. And we're pleased that we now have 5 different combination vaccine candidates in early clinical trials, including 2 specifically designed for pediatric populations.\nWith 11 programs in clinical trials, including 4 in Phase III and covering 5 different respiratory viruses, we believe this represents the broadest and most advanced portfolio of respiratory virus vaccine candidates. Now turning specifically to COVID.\nThe FDA recently provided updates on several fronts. Our Omicron-targeting bivalent COVID-19 vaccine targeting the original MBA 45 strains is now our only authorized formulation in the United States with a simplified and streamlined regimen for both children and adults. Individuals, 65 years of age and those with certain kinds of immunocompromise are now also eligible to receive additional doses as needed or recommended by their physicians. As we look to the fall, the strain selection for an updated composition for fall 2023 boosters is now expected to come at the June 15 VRBPAC meeting.\nMoving to RSV. We're pleased by the profile of our vaccine in older adults with high and consistent efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract disease across populations in our large Phase III study. At 2 recent medical meetings, we've shared data showing our vaccine's efficacy was consistently high across all age groups, including in the oldest adult and in participants with preexisting comorbidities that put them at higher risk.\nmRNA-1345 has also shown a favorable tolerability profile with AEs mostly grade 1 or grade 2, mild to moderate. As we shared during Vaccines Day, today, we have not seen any cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome or other severe [indiscernible] events in the trial.\nMoving to flu. Our Phase III efficacy study in the Northern Hemisphere, P302 is ongoing. And last month, we announced that the study did not accrue sufficient cases to declare early success at the interim analysis and that the DSMB recommended that we continue the study. That trial is still accruing cases through the end of this flu season with an update expected this summer. The preliminary immunogenicity data from that P302 study showed that [ HAI neutralizing titers ] were consistent with superiority for both A strains and non-inferior immunogenicity for the B strains when compared to the licensed flu vaccine.\nNow I'm pleased to announce that we've initiated our Phase III P303 flu study with an updated formulation of mRNA-1010. P303 is testing an update that is designed to increase the HAI neutralizing titers against the B antigens. This is an immunogenicity study and is expected to enroll approximately 2,400 adults this spring. We believe this study will support our initial flu filing and the potential for a 2024 launch if approved by regulators.\nNow turning to our latent vaccines. Our CMV vaccine Phase III study in women and childbearing age is ongoing and has enrolled more than 50% of participants. We also have an ongoing Phase I/II adolescent dose-ranging study with this vaccine that will expand potential eligible populations. As Stefan mentioned earlier, we continue to make significant progress against all of our latent vaccines in earlier-stage clinical trials, including candidates against EBV, HIV and [ PCV ]. As Stephane mentioned, our EBV vaccine includes 2 vaccine candidates, our EBV program includes 2 vaccine candidates mRNA-1189 and mRNA-1195 and are in clinical trials for prevention of infectious mononucleosis and for the prevention of longer-term sequela of EBV infection respectively.\nNot Vaccines Day, we are pleased to share interim results of our HIV vaccine, mRNA-1644, which continues to advance. Our pipeline in therapeutics targets unmet needs across immuno-oncology, rare disease, cardiovascular disease and autoimmune diseases. All the trials in these therapeutic areas are ongoing. And today, I'll highlight a few of the recent updates.\nOn Slide 16, are the data shared at AACR from our Phase II study in adjuvant melanoma with a combination of our individualized neoantigen therapy plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone. The Kaplan-Meier curve for relapse-free survival solution here. Overall, there was a 44% reduction in the rate of relapse or death with a combination of INT and KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone. We are encouraged by the continued separation of the 2 curves with a follow-up at 18 months. Note that there are very few participants beyond the 140 week cutoff at the right of this slide, less than 10 participants in total. Thus, as the data continues to mature, with additional follow-up time, we remain cautiously optimistic that this picture will get even better.\nNow on Slide 17, I want to briefly highlight some of the additional data that was shared at AACR. The subgroup analysis confirm the strength of the treatment effect across 2 important markers that are known to predict responses to KEYTRUDA. Again, on this slide, we're looking at the relapse-free survival.\nOn the left side, the results are stratified by high tumor mutational burden in red and low tumor mutational burden in blue. In each case, the solid lines are for the INT combination and the dash line is for KEYTRUDA monotherapy control. If you start by looking and comparing the control arms for KEYTRUDA, you will note that the TMB high participants, the red dash line, have a higher relapse-free survival than the TMB low participants in the blue dash line. This is expected because of what we know about KEYTRUDA, and shows that the controls are performing as we expect.\nNow moving to the INT combination arms, the solid lines and comparing them against the dotted lines of the same color, you can clearly see that the INT combination led to higher relapse-free survival for both TMB high and TMB low patients. This highlights the robustness of the response for INT. It's also quite exciting to note that the improved response rate seen in the blue TMB low population, which historically does not respond well -- as well to KEYTRUDA.\nOn the right, you'll see the result as stratified by PD-L1 status. Now as with the TMB analysis, PD-L1 is known to predict response rates to immunotherapy. As you can see by the dashed lines for KEYTRUDA monotherapy control groups, the relapse-free survival curves look better for PD-L1 positive tumors, these are the red dash lines, and worse for patients unfortunate enough have PD-L1 negative tumors, the blue dashed lines. This isn't surprising as KEYTRUDA monotherapy acts by blocking the PD-1, PD-L1 access.\nAs with TMB on the left, the solid lines on the RFS curves for the combination show the combination of INT, red denotes PD-L1 positive and blue denotes PD-L1 negative. In both cases, there is an increase in the rate of relapse-free survival with the combination treatment. It is encouraging to note again that the response rates are significantly improved for the PD-L1 negative patients. Indeed, the hazard ratio in this subgroup analysis is 0.162.\nNow pulling back, these data highlights that the observed improvement in relapse-free survival seen in the initial analysis of our Phase II study looks broad-based across subgroups with an indication of a potentially important benefit even in patients who have higher risk of progression, whether due to PD-L1 status or tumor mutational burden compared to KEYTRUDA monotherapy alone.\nNow these positive data are just the beginning for this ongoing study. We'll be sharing additional data from the Phase II study at ASCO, including distant metastasis-free survival which was a secondary endpoint in the primary analysis just conducted and the same data cuts that I just shared. We'll also be sharing important additional biomarker data. In addition, this protocol calls for subsequent analysis at 51 events, which is when we will also be updating the Kaplan-Meier curves for [indiscernible] survival with longer follow-up time across the full population, and we eagerly await those updates.\nINT has received breakthrough therapy in the United States and PRIME designation in Europe, which will facilitate frequent dialogue with regulators as we work to quickly advance this treatment for patients. As Stephane mentioned earlier, we plan to initiate our Phase III study in adjuvant melanoma in 2023 and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. We're working closely with our partner, Merck, to explore additional opportunities within KEYTRUDA approved indications and beyond that label. And finally, a quick update on our propionic acidemia program.\nOur Phase I/II study is ongoing and currently enrolling patients in the 0.9 milligrams per kilogram cohort. We have identified a dose for expansion and have moved into that expansion arm in the study. I'm pleased to announce just yesterday that a clinical update through the earlier -- time point earlier this year, including an update on safety and the rate of major metabolic compensations from the higher dose cohorts and including longer-term follow-up from the lower dose cohorts will now be presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy Meeting on May 18.\nThe abstract for that presentation is now available and can be found in the link on this slide. We look forward to sharing a lot more about the progress of this medicine and our other rare disease programs in the months ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arpa.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good day to everyone. I will first start with a review of sales in the quarter. On Slide 22, we summarized the composition of our sales in the first quarter. As you'll see on the chart, our sales to Europe were $0.6 billion and sales to the rest of the world were $1.3 billion. Approximately $1.8 billion of sales from previously announced APAs were delivered in the first quarter of 2023, representing the vast majority of the $2 billion expected in the first half of 2023. As a reminder, U.S. sales for COVID vaccines are expected to begin in the second half of 2023, with updated strain mass vaccine.\nNow as we turn to Slide 23, looking at the 2023 COVID deliveries, Today, we are reiterating a minimum of approximately $5 billion in COVID vaccine deliveries from current advanced purchase agreements. And we continue to expect additional orders from key markets.\nOf the $5 billion in 2023 deliveries from previously announced APAs, $2 billion, as I mentioned earlier, are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2023. We have already delivered $1.8 billion of that $2 billion in the first quarter with substantial fulfillment to Japan and the European Union. We expect to deliver the remaining approximately $3 billion in previously announced APAs in the second half of this year. Additionally, we expect new sales in the U.S., Japan, European Union, Asia and Latin America. I'm happy to announce that the commercial team has signed a contract with the Australian Government for 2023.\nOur discussion with commercial buyers in the U.S. are positive, and I will elaborate on that shortly. In our discussions with commercial customers in the U.S. It is clear that our customers are aware that COVID is still a substantial health urban. Throughout 2022, COVID continued to be a leading cause of hospitalizations.\nData available through September 2022, list COVID as the third leading cost of death in the U.S. only after heart disease and cancer, as shown in the first chart on the left. The chart on the right-hand side of the slide shows the most recent data available for U.S. hospitalizations for COVID, flu and RSV. As you'll see, with current season hospitalizations of over 600,000 per COVID, the hospitalization rate for COVID is almost triple that of flu as well as more than triple that of RSV. There continues to be a clear need to protect against severe COVID infections and our customers recognize that need.\nFor full of 2023, we expect the U.S. market volume to be approximately 100 million doses. As we highlighted earlier in the year, the successful transition of our U.S. COVID business from a government driven to a commercial-driven model is critical. We have made great progress on this front, executing on our action plan to rapidly develop this commercial market. Importantly, the commercial team is in active discussions with customers throughout the U.S. We are contracting with national and regional pharmacies, integrated delivery networks, government health providers, including the VA, the CDC and the Department of Defense, for purchasing, organizations and other providers.\nIn addition, our established national distribution infrastructure and our Moderna Direct e-commerce site is fully operational. Our global supply chain is in place to handle all U.S. customer needs including prefilled syringes and single-dose files at the time of launch. I'm excited to share some of the launch preparation activities for the updated COVID-19 vaccine for fall vaccination campaigns. We believe these activities will drive consumers to get vaccinated.\nFirst, we are taking an omnichannel approach via tailored digital messaging to healthcare providers. This multifaceted approach will allow us to drive broad awareness and continue to emphasize the ongoing need for COVID production. Later this year, we will be disseminating customized content to drive physician demand across immunizing physicians, institutional decision-makers, as well as influencers.\nWe are also partnering with our customer base across the different commercial segments to assist with their fall immunization programs. We believe there's an opportunity to continue to provide education, both to staff as well as to patients. And we believe there is an opportunity to harmonize and simplify the vaccination process for patients who are going in to skip their flu vaccine.\nConsumer promotion will be focused primarily in the fall of this year, driving patients to seek Moderna's COVID vaccine through significant DTC efforts. As I mentioned earlier, we are looking to simplify the experience for our consumers who are already going in together seasonal influenza vaccine this fall. We are energized for this fall season.\nMoving on to Slide 27. I will update you on our second near-term commercial opportunity, which is RSV. We are excited for the expected 2024 launch of our RSV vaccine and the commercial team is undertaking a number of activities to ensure that we develop what we hope will be a large share of that market as quickly as possible. We are already raising awareness of the health and economic burden of RSV by generating and presenting detailed data from our Phase III study at major medical meetings.\nOur medical team has shared additional data showing that vaccine efficacy is consistently high across all tested age groups as well as in participants with preexisting comorbidities. The figures on the right-hand side of the slide, detail efficacy data in these important subgroups. As we share these data at medical congresses, we are encouraged by [indiscernible] and key opinion leader feedback on our data and the application of our mRNA platform to prevent [indiscernible].\nWe're engaging with payers and ITAC to ensure access upon launch. And the commercial team is active in local markets preparing for a commercial launch in 2024. Specifically, we are building our digital capabilities so that we will be able to efficiently educate customers as soon as the vaccine is approved. And as we invest in prelaunch activities, we have already begun manufacturing components of the vaccine and prefilled syringes. We are excited about the profile of the products we will be launching into these large respiratory markets.\nAs we discussed at Vaccines Day, the estimated total addressable markets for our 3 key respiratory vaccines are substantial. With COVID, RSV and flu offering potential addressable markets of $15 billion, $6 billion to $8 billion and $6 billion to $9 billion, respectively. We believe we can take a sizable share of this roughly $30 billion respiratory market.\nThe commercial team is well underway in preparing for RSV and flu launches in 2024. We believe our opportunity in the respiratory market will continue to expand beyond 2024 with our next-gen vaccines and importantly, with future combination vaccines, positioning us to drive share over time.\nNow on to Slide 29, I want to share with you how the commercial team is helping identify eligible patient populations in the Atrovent and Neoadjuvant settings for various tumor types. Along with our partner, Merck, we have already announced that we will start Phase III trials in Adjuvant melanoma and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer. There is an annual population of over 130,000 new patients in the U.S. and Europe in these 2 indications.\nPatient populations for additional potential adjuvant and neoadjuvant tumor types are listed on the right-hand side. Our commercial teams are working closely with our clinical teams to identify the largest unmet need for addressable tumor types for individualized neoantigen therapy. We are excited to be launching into a space where we have 1 medicine for 1 patient in areas of great [indiscernible] in cancer. Given the individualized approach, we are reimagining our commercial model, along with our partner, along with patient care journey, end-to-end.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)\n\nThanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone. This morning, I will cover our Q1 financial performance, review the framework for our 2023 financial outlook and provide a quick recap from our recent Vaccines Day presentation. Moving to our first quarter results, starting on Slide 31.\nTotal product sales decreased 69% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, the decrease in 2023 is consistent with our expectations and mainly driven by lower sales volume compared to the prior year. Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2023 was $792 million, in addition to our unit-driven manufacturing costs, this includes royalties of $86 million and the following charges: $148 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 products; unutilized manufacturing capacity of $135 million; and losses on firm purchase commitments and related cancellation fees of $95 million. These charges, other than royalties, were driven by costs associated with surplus production capacity and an overall lower demand forecast primarily from lower-income countries.\nCost of sales as a percent of product sales was 43% compared to 17% in Q1 2022. The increase was driven by the aforementioned charges over lower product sales compared to the prior year and higher manufacturing costs as we switch to smaller dose vials as well as lower product sales to absorb fixed manufacturing costs.\nResearch and development expenses were $1.1 billion, which increased by 104% versus the prior year. The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by clinical trial-related expenses particularly with our Phase III studies for RSV, seasonal flu and CMV. The increase in R&D was also attributable to increases in personnel-related costs due to increased headcount and our recently announced collaboration agreements with Life Edit and Generation Bio.\nSG&A expenses were $305 million, reflecting an increase of 14% year-over-year. The growth in spending was primarily driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of our marketed products and related commercialization activities as well as our company expansion.\nIncome tax provision was a net benefit of $384 million for the first quarter, driven by our full year outlook, which includes international provisions, R&D credits and nonrecurring items. Net income was $79 million compared to a net income of $3.7 billion last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.19 compared to a diluted earnings per share of $8.58 in Q1 2022.\nWe ended Q1 with cash and investments of $16.4 billion compared to $18.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was driven by a reduction of cash deposits as we delivered products against prepayments and our share buyback activity. Cash deposits for future product supply declined from $2.6 billion at the end of 2022 to $1.8 billion by the end of Q1 2023, in line with our expectations.\nNow turning to Slide 33. I want to give an update on the progress we have made on our capital allocation priorities. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. As mentioned earlier, R&D spending in the first quarter increased 104% year-over-year, and we continue to project R&D investments of approximately $4.5 billion for the full year of 2023.\nAs discussed at our Vaccine Day presentation, the majority of this investment is for our respiratory vaccine franchise, which we expect to generate significant returns in the relatively near term. We are also investing in our digital capabilities. The commercial build-out of the organization as well as expanding our manufacturing footprint. We plan to significantly accelerate our capital expenditures in 2023 as we expand both our international and U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investments and collaboration opportunities that will enable and complement our platform. As previously announced, we successfully closed our acquisition of OriCiro in the first quarter and the integration of the operations are well underway. Additionally, we entered into 2 collaboration agreements during the quarter with Life Edit and Generation Bio. We are in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. In the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 3.6 million shares for $526 million. We had 2.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining as of March 31, 2023.\nNow let's turn to our updated 2023 financial framework on Slide 34. We continue to have advanced purchase agreements for COVID vaccine sales of approximately $5 billion for delivery in 2023. And we are in active negotiations for commercial market and government contracts in the U.S. and additional contracts for Japan, the EU and other key markets. We continue to expect first half sales to be approximately $2 billion.\nDue to the seasonal nature of our respiratory business, we expect sales in Q2 of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion. We continue to expect fiscal year 2023 reported cost of sales to be 35% to 40% of sales which includes 5% royalties. For Q2, we expect cost of sales between $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, we expect our cost of sales in the first half of the year to be above the range of 35% to 40% and then reduce our average through the second half of the year.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $6 billion, with approximately $4.5 billion in research and development. We now anticipate a full year tax benefit of $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion, driven by R&D credits, international provisions and nonrecurring items. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion.\nBefore I turn the call back to Stephan, for those who weren't able to attend or haven't seen the webcast from our Vaccines Day presentation, I wanted to quickly recap the financial takeaways. Given the current significant investment in our respiratory franchise, we wanted to lay out the potential return we envision by the year 2027 for this franchise.\nPicking up where Arpa ended her earlier remarks, we believe the market size for COVID, RSV and flu will be over $30 billion by 2027, and we expect to capture $8 billion to $15 billion of this marketplace. While our cost of goods sold percentage will remain elevated in the short term as we transition from a pandemic to an endemic environment, we believe this should normalize to a 20% to 25% range by 2027.\nWe also laid out a $6 billion to $8 billion cumulative R&D investment required over the next 3 years, which will then normalize to a routine maintenance amount of 10% electoratory vaccines revenue by 2027. Finally, we like the characteristics of the respiratory vaccine franchise, given the highly flexible cost base, low capital intensity, durable future revenue and high potential return, which could lead to $4 billion to $9 billion of free cash flow annually with further room for growth.\nThis concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call back over to Stephane.\n\nStephane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jamie, Arpa and Stephen. Let me share some thoughts before we close into Q&A. Not another promising commercial outlook as several development projects come to fruition. In COVID, we are finalizing discussions with customers. And I believe that we'll see significant additional contracts in the U.S., in Japan and around the world for '23.\nCOVID is not going away and governments are getting ready for vaccination campaign in the fall. I'm pleased that we have begun prelaunch market development and as risk manufacturing for RSV, which we expect to launch in '24. And in oncology, the team is making great progress. We expect to deliver key milestones on our development pipeline in the remaining 8 months of 2023. We expect regulatory authorities to give us direction on COVID strain with the June VRBPAC meeting, and we expect to launch an updated COVID-19 vaccine for fall of '23.\nWe plan to file for approval for RSV vaccine and of Phase II/III to study should be fully enrolled by this summer, and we expect data in Q4. For INT cancer therapy, we expect to make additional Phase II update, launch of our Phase III study in adjuvant melanoma and expand into additional cancer types. And we'll continue to make progress in our revenues portfolio. We present data for [indiscernible] on May 18.\nThis is a very exciting time for us at Moderna, and I would like to thank our teams for all their hard work and their commitment to our mission. Our platform is firing on all cylinders. In Infectious Disease vaccine, look at the data and the portfolio of respiratory, latent and now entering a bacterial vaccine. Very excited by where INT is and is going. And [indiscernible] followed closely by [ MMA ] and [ GSD1a ].\nWe'll give some key updates this year. On September 13, we have our annual R&D there. We will present new development pipeline data and on December 7, we'll be hosting our second annual ESG day. We believe that the incredible progress we have made across all of our modality, positions our company for long-term financial success. But the mission of our company was motivated for our entire team to come to work every day is to deliver the greatest possible impact to people for mRNA medicine.\nWe believe we have a technology to eliminate or greatly reduced human suffering caused by respiratory viruses, latent viruses, bacteria, cancer, regulating disease and a growing list of diseases. We work to bring a number of our more promising technologies to market in the next several years and have paused to continue to fulfill on our mission.\nWith this, we'll take questions. Operator?",

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised this call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna. Please proceed.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results and Business Update. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stephane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamie Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 2022 conference call. Today, I will start with a quick business review of 2022. Stephen will then review our clinical programs before Arpa gives an update on our commercial progress and plans. Jamie will then present our financial results, and I will come back to share some thoughts on where we're heading.\nWe are pleased to report today revenues of $19.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, GAAP net income of $8.4 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $20.12. Cash and investment balances of $18.2 billion at the end of the year.\nWe continued our disciplined capital allocation policy. We're investing first in our company. In 2022, we invested $3.3 billion in R&D, our highest level of R&D investments ever. We invested $1.1 billion in SG&A and $400 million in capital investments. We made investments in Metagenomi for access to new gene editing enzymes and Carisma in oncology. We announced an investment in CytomX and the acquisition of OriCiro in Japan to continue to streamline our manufacturing processes. And just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with LifeEdit. $3.3 billion were returned to shareholders through a buyback of 23 million shares.\nI am proud of the strong results by our team in 2022 as we made history with a number of outstanding accomplishment for patients. In respiratory vaccines, we developed new products with remarkable speed, getting the mRNA-1273.214 against Omicron B1, the strain recommended by WHO, and mRNA-1273.222 against Omicron BA.5, the strain [asked] by the U.S. FDA. We developed 1273.222 in less than 2 months. We're able to protect millions of people from potentially severe disease resulting from new COVID strains.\nOur RSV vaccine went from Phase I start to Phase III data in 24 months, and met its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III trial. In oncology, our Personalized Cancer Vaccine was the first demonstration of positive results from an mRNA cancer treatment in the randomized clinical trial.\nIn rare diseases, our propionic acidemia program showed early positive clinical results in a repeat dose chronic disease setting in reducing metabolic decompensation events in patients. And we announced what we hope will become the first effective inhaled mRNA therapy in humans as our partner, Vertex, entered a Phase I trial using our technology in the therapy for cystic fibrosis patients who lack CFTR protein.\nFinally, we had our first ESG Day and published our first ESG report, providing additional transparency in how we conduct our business.\nI want to take a moment this morning to touch on transition the Moderna Executive Committee. As we announced in late 2022, Marcello Damiani decided to retire as Chief Digital Officer after more than 7 years with the company. Marcello joined Moderna before our first clinical trial, and we are today, a digital-first company, as a big testament of his ability to scale digital resources. I'm grateful to Marcello for his contribution during the early years of Moderna.\nI am excited to have worked already with Brad Miller since early January. Brad brings a wealth of enterprise solution and platform organization experience in several of the top technology companies. This will be instrumental as Moderna scales into a fully-integrated biotechnology company.\nI want to also share with you that Juan Andres, currently President of Strategic Partnership and Enterprise Expansion has informed me of his intention to retire and will be retiring at the end of May. Juan has played a tremendous role since joining Moderna in 2017 from Novartis, where he led all manufacturing for them. Juan served as Moderna's Chief Technology Operations and Quality Officer where he led the manufacturing from an early-stage clinical development company to a commercial company.\nI believe Juan did a historic job with his team in 2020 and 2021 to scale Moderna for global commercial launch during the pandemic. It is literally unbelievable that he led the team from having made across our entire portfolio, less than 100 million doses in 2019 to more than 800 million doses in 2021, all during the pandemic. We, and hundreds of millions of people across the globe who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, owe Juan our gratitude. I believe very few manufacturing leaders would have led such an achievement.\nMost recently, Juan has focused on building out our organization to support Moderna's growing pipeline, leading our efforts in producing of personalized cancer vaccine. Jerh, who used to work for Juan at Novartis, has joined us since early fall and has been leading manufacturing since then. I am thankful to Juan, who has ensured a very smooth transition, helping Jerh every step of the way. Upon his retirement at the end of May, Juan's responsibility will transition to Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna, to integrate PCV across all functions, with Jerh leading the manufacturing of PCV for multiple Phase IIIs, and of course, for getting commercial ready.\nOn behalf of the entire Moderna team, I want to thank Juan for his continued leadership and wish him and his wife, Marina, the best of a well-deserved retirement. I am deeply thankful to have counted him for so many years as a partner at Moderna, and more importantly, for more than 20 years as a friend and a mentor. We will miss him.\nThe company continues to expand at a rapid pace. We now have 3 commercial COVID-19 vaccine products. We have 4 development programs in Phase III. We have to expand our commercial portfolio very soon. Overall, we have 48 programs underway with a team of 3,900 team members, and now present on the ground in 16 commercial subsidiary across Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our $18 billion of cash balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, clinical development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A.\nWith that, let me now talk to Stephen.\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephane. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our progress against our key clinical programs.\nI'll start with our respiratory vaccines. We have approved our Phase III development programs against the big 3 respiratory viruses, COVID-19, RSV and influenza. I'll share some additional data on these in a moment, including some presented this morning on our older adult RSV Phase III trial. We're also advancing a portfolio of next-generation programs against these viruses, including mRNA-1283, which is a next-generation COVID-19 booster that is referred to as rather stable. We also have multiple next-generation flu programs. We seek to increase the breadth of coverage against influenza by adding additional antigens that are not present in currently-available flu vaccines. Lastly, our respiratory portfolio includes a large number of combination vaccines to provide protection against multiple respiratory pathogens which has advantages for many stakeholders, including health care providers, payers and consumers. These include combinations of COVID, flu and RSV, as well as 2 pediatric vaccines that include additional viruses that are important in children, including hMPV and PIV3.\nAs we prepare for endemic COVID in 2023 and beyond, we wanted to briefly recap the recent VRBPAC committee discussions and recommendations. At the January VRBPAC meeting, the committee voted to harmonize the primary series and booster dose vaccines, which is an important step to simplify future guidance. The FDA also indicated that it expects to convene VRBPAC to determine vaccine strain composition for the '23-'24 season in the second quarter of this year. We believe that our mRNA platform has demonstrated its ability to deliver variant match vaccines on accelerated time horizons, and we believe we are therefore well positioned to deliver whatever composition of the FDA and other public health agencies recommend.\nNow, moving to RSV. As you know, we shared the topline results from our Phase III RSV study in older adults earlier this year. And today, we shared additional data that was presented this morning at RSVVW. The top line results we've seen are incredibly encouraging, and we're grateful to the FDA for breakthrough therapy designation for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need.\nIn the top line data presented in January, the mRNA-1345 demonstrated 83.7% vaccine efficacy and the primary endpoint of lower respiratory tract disease with 2 or more symptoms. 1345 was found to be generally well tolerated, and there were no safety concerns identified by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.\nIn the data presented today at RSVVW, we confirmed that 1345 was well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile. Solicited adverse reactions were mostly Grade 1 or Grade 2, and to date, most solicited adverse reactions were mild to moderate, with the most common adverse reactions being injection site pain, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. Vaccine efficacy was consistently high across all age groups and in participants with pre-existing comorbidities that are at highest risk.\nPlease refer to the scientific and medical meetings section of the Moderna Investor Relations website to see the full RSVVW presentation. And we're very encouraged by these data, and look forward to file a Biologics License Application with the FDA in the first half of 2023, as things proceed. With the option of using a priority review voucher, we might see regulatory action on this filing in late 2023 or early 2024.\nNow moving to flu. Last week, we shared with you data from our Phase III Immunogenicity and Safety study in the Southern Hemisphere, study P301. In this study, our first-generation vaccine, mRNA-1010, demonstrated superiority on 0 conversion rates for influenza A/H3 and H1 and superiority on geometric mean titers for H3 and non-inferiority on geometric mean titers for H1. MRNA-1010 did not meet non-inferiority on 0 conversion or titers for the 2 influenza B strains.\nOur separate Phase III efficacy study in the Northern Hemisphere, study P302, has now accrued over 200 confirmed cases of influenza-like illness, almost all of which are influenza A. Which is expected -- this was expected as the overwhelming majority of influenza burden in older adults is caused by influenza A, including over 95% of hospitalization in the most recent season.\nNow based on the case accrual in P302, we now expect the independent DSMB will review the first interim analysis of efficacy in that study in the first quarter of this year.\nNow let's take a look at our latent vaccines on Slide 14. Our CMV vaccine is in an ongoing Phase III study, and we've begun dosing participants in the Phase I/II adolescent dose-ranging study. Our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis is in Phase I, while our EBV vaccine to prevent long-term sequelae of EBV is in pre-clinical development. We have 2 HIV Phase I trials ongoing, and our HSV vaccine is in preclinical.\nAnd finally, our VZV program has begun dosing in participants in a Phase I/II study, which I will discuss further on the next slide. The VZV study is a Phase I/II randomized safety and immunogenicity study evaluating mRNA-1468 against Shingrix. This is a relatively large study, enrolling 500 0 negative older adults in multiple doses and dosing intervals, and a 12-month study follow-up. Over 35% of participants will be 70 years and older, which is in line with the largest disease burden of shingles.\nNow, let's take a look at our therapeutics portfolio on Slide 16, and I'll highlight a few of the programs. We recently reported strong top line data for our personalized cancer vaccine, which I will talk to in a moment. In Immuno-oncology, we are working to address disease burden beyond PCV with our checkpoint and triplet programs, both of which are in Phase I trials in various tumor types.\nIn rare diseases, our Phase I/II PA program continues to enroll patients and we are looking forward to selecting a dose of the expansion arm. I'll provide a brief update on that in just a moment.\nEarlier this year, our partner, Vertex, announced an initiation of a Phase I trial in cystic fibrosis patients, which is our first inhaled pulmonary mRNA therapeutic program. And in Cardiovascular, we announced Relaxin has initiated dosing in the Phase I study. Both of these study initiations represent important milestones for Moderna as we expand our modalities in therapeutic areas.\nNow in December, we shared exciting top line data from our Phase II personalized cancer vaccine program, testing the combination of PCV and KEYTRUDA against KEYTRUDA alone in the setting of adjuvant melanoma. KEYTRUDA is the standard of care in that setting.\nIn this study, we showed the addition of our personalized cancer vaccine treatment mRNA-4157 to KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 44% compared to KEYTRUDA alone. This was the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA cancer treatment in a randomized clinical trial, and we are pleased to announce that 4157 has received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Along with our partner, Merck, we are excited about these results and expect to launch multiple late-stage confirmatory studies for PCV in 2023, starting with melanoma and then moving to non-small cell lung cancer.\nWe are planning to explore additional indications for 4157, where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for immune-stimulating approaches. These include early-stage and metastatic settings and will include indications where KEYTRUDA is not yet approved.\nFinally, we expect to release full data from our Phase II study at an oncology meeting this spring and in an upcoming publication.\nNow moving to PA. Since our update with our -- at our R&D Day, the PA Paramount study has made good progress. Our fourth cohort is now fully enrolled, and we're currently enrolling patients in our fifth cohort which doses at 0.9 milligrams per kilogram every 2 weeks. We are encouraged that to date, we have not observed any dose-limiting toxicities. And we're also encouraged that all patients and families have opted to continue treatment electively in our Open-Label Expansion study across all prior dose cohorts.\nNow, the next step in this trial will be to review available data and determine a dose for expansion.\nI'll now hand the call over to Arpa Garay, who will provide an update on our commercial activities. Arpa?\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good day to everyone. I will start with a review of sales on Slide 20.\nIn the fourth quarter, total product sales were $4.9 billion. In the U.S., our sales were $1 billion, sales in Europe approximated $2.2 billion, and sales in the rest of the world were $1.6 billion. We ended the full year strong, with total product sales for 2022 of $18.4 billion. Sales in the U.S. for the full year were $4.4 million, sales in Europe were $6.7 million, and in the rest of the world were $7.3 billion. We are reiterating approximately $5 billion in COVID sales for delivery in 2023 from our currently-signed advanced purchase agreements and deferrals. And we do expect additional sales from key markets such as the U.S., EU and Japan.\nSlide 21 summarizes the current composition of sales for 2023. We have advanced purchase agreements from Canada, Kuwait, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We expect these sales to be recognized upon delivery of vaccines in the second half of 2023. Additionally, we expect further sales from deferrals from 2022 contracts. These deferrals are from the countries listed on the slide, and are expected to be mainly recognized from deliveries in the first half of 2023. Together, these advanced purchase agreements and deferrals totaled approximately $5 billion in sales for 2023.\nWe do expect additional sales from key markets, including the United States, EU and Japan, as well as Australia and other countries in Asia and Latin America. In the U.S., contracting discussions with commercial customers are ongoing, and we will provide visibility into expected U.S. sales at a future date after we complete these discussions.\nIn our discussions with commercial customers in the U.S., it is clear to us that our customers recognize that COVID is still a substantial health burden. Throughout 2022, COVID continued to be a leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths.\nIf you look to the chart on the left-hand side, what you'll see here is data available through September of 2022, COVID was the third leading cause of death in the United States only after heart disease and cancer.\nAnd if you look to the right-hand side, (technical difficulty) four months for the fall and winter season from October 1, 2022, (technical difficulty) 2023, hospitalizations from COVID in the U.S. are nearly 450,000, more than double from flu and nearly 3x higher than RSV in that same 4-month period. There continues to be a clear need to protect against severe COVID infections and our customers recognize that.\nGiven this need, we estimate the U.S. fall 2023 COVID market volume to be approximately 100 million doses. We base this assumption after looking at 2022 vaccination rates, and including potential recommendation for 2-dose booster series for high-risk individuals. Taken together, the doses administered represent roughly 30% of the U.S. population.\nA few factors that can impact this volume include viral evolution, regulatory recommendations as well as vaccine understanding and uptake by consumers. Moderna's commercial organization is prepared for the transition to a commercial market in the U.S.\nLet me now take you through how we have been preparing to go to market. First and foremost, we are committed to access, which I will explain in greater detail in just a moment. To ensure coverage of our vaccine, we are engaged in discussions with private customers as well as public entities such as the VA, CDC and the Department of Defense. We are increasing awareness and educating consumers as well as healthcare providers about the benefits of booster vaccinations in alignment with public health agencies such as CDC and ACIP. We are reaching healthcare providers and consumers through innovative digital outreach programs. We have built the infrastructure needed to fulfill customer orders and shipments, and our commercial and medical organizations have been scaling to execute on this plan, and we are ready for the transition to a commercial market in the United States.\nVery importantly, as we enter the commercial phase of the endemic COVID market, we want to emphasize our commitment to vaccines access for everyone in the United States regardless of their ability to pay. For all insured individuals in the United States, consistent with preventative health services requirements, current reimbursement rules will be sustained. As an ACIP-recommended vaccine, Moderna's COVID vaccine will continue to be available for 0 out-of-pocket costs for individuals with insurance. And we are proud to say that for uninsured or underinsured people in the United States, Moderna will be launching a patient assistance program that will provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost.\nLet me now summarize our COVID vaccine outlook. In 2023, we expect COVID sales of approximately $5 billion. In addition, we are expecting sales from U.S. commercial market orders, EU, Japan and other countries. We will provide visibility into these sales after we complete ongoing discussions with governments and with customers.\nWe recognize COVID continues to be a burden to healthcare systems, and this continues to be an important point as we discuss the value of booster vaccinations with our customers. In the U.S., we expect commercial market volumes to be approximately 100 million doses in 2023, and Moderna's commercial organization is prepared for the transition to a commercial endemic market. Last but not least, we are committed to patient access in the United States.\nI now want to turn to another launch in the respiratory vaccine space that the commercial team is preparing for, our RSV vaccine in 2024. As you heard from both Stephane and Stephen earlier, we are very pleased by our Phase III RSV vaccine results. Stephen's organization will be filing for the approval soon, and we expect we may be approved in late 2023 or early 2024. With the potential approval fast approaching, I'm very excited for the RSV vaccine launch, and I want to provide additional color into the launch plans.\nThe RSV launch will leverage the existing commercial infrastructure that is already in place for COVID and we will continue to invest to support it, ensuring strong execution. Both COVID and RSV markets overlap considerably as we look at our target customers as well as potential target patients and audiences, and we will leverage this overlap between the 2 markets. We will ensure awareness of RSV disease and the associated economic burden of RSV in older adults across key stakeholders such as healthcare providers and payers. Upon approval of our RSV vaccine, we will educate consumers on key attributes of our vaccine. These planned activities will be initiated in 2023 and in full force upon approval. We have the added benefit of an in-place commercial infrastructure built for COVID. Many of these resources can be leveraged for flu as well into the future.\nI look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout this year. And with that, I will turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nCFO, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone. This morning, I will cover our 2022 financial performance and provide a framework for our 2023 financial outlook.\nMoving to our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 29. Total product sales decreased by 30% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. The decrease in 2022 was mainly driven by lower sales volume compared to overall higher demand in the prior year. Cost of sales was 39% of product sales compared to 14% of product sales in 2021. The key driver of the increase in cost of sales as a percent of product sales was a catch-up royalty payment to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, of $400 million, representing 8% of product sales in the fourth quarter.\nIn December 2022, we entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and institute or center of the NIH to license certain patent rights concerning stabilizing prefusion coronavirus spike proteins and the resulting stabilized proteins for the use in COVID-19 vaccine products or 2P technology. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to pay low single-digit royalties on future net sales of our COVID-19 vaccines.\nOur cost of sales also includes a charge of $297 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 products, an expense for unutilized manufacturing capacity, and CMO wind-down costs and related charges of $376 million, and a loss on firm purchase commitments and related cancellation fees of $281 million. These charges other than royalties are driven by costs associated with surplus production capacity, overall lower demand and a shift to our most recent Omicron BA.4/5 targeting COVID-19 bivalent booster.\nResearch and development expenses were $1.2 billion, which increased by 87% versus prior year. The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by our clinical trial expenses, particularly with our Phase III studies for RSV, seasonal flu and CMV. The increase in R&D was also driven by the acquisition of a Priority Review Voucher and an increase in personnel-related costs due to increased headcount.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $375 million, also reflecting an increase of 87% year-over-year. The growth in spending was primarily driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of our marketed products and company build-up.\nThe effective tax rate was 11% compared to 10% last year. After-tax net income decreased by 70% to $1.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share in Q4 decreased by 68% to $3.61.\nNow turning to our full year 2022 financial results on Slide 30. Total product sales for the full year 2022 were $18.4 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. The growth was mainly attributable to customer mix and a higher average selling price in 2022 in certain markets. Cost of sales was 29% of product sales compared to 15% of product sales last year. The increase was driven by higher write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory related to our COVID-19 vaccines, unutilized manufacturing capacity and losses related to future purchase commitments for raw materials. The key drivers for these charges are similar to the drivers in Q4. Costs associated with surplus production capacity, overall lower demand for the year, in particular from low-income countries, and rapid product advance shift from our original vaccine to Omicron targeting COVID-19 bivalent boosters. The previously-mentioned catch-up royalty payment NIH of $400 million is also a driver of the increase year-over-year.\nThe effective tax rate was 13% compared to 8% last year. As a reminder, we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020, which resulted in a non-recurring benefit to the reported tax rate in 2021. After-tax net income of $8.4 billion decreased 31% versus prior year. The decrease of net income was primarily due to higher cost of sales, higher other operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted EPS decreased 29% to $20.12.\nNow turning to cash and cash deposits on Slide 31. We ended 2022 with cash and investments of $18.2 billion, compared to $17 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was driven by our commercial activity. Cash deposits for future product supply reduced from $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter to $2.6 billion by the end of the year.\nNow turning to Slide 32. I wanted to give an update on the progress we have made on our capital allocation priorities. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in our base business across multiple areas.\nResearch and development spending increased 65% year-over-year from $2 billion in 2021 to $3.3 billion in 2022, and we are projecting an additional increase to approximately $4.5 billion in 2023. The clinical data from our PCV, RSV and flu trials were encouraging and further validates the potential of our mRNA technology. We are also investing in our digital capabilities, the commercial build-out of the organization as well as expanding our manufacturing footprint. We plan to significantly accelerate our capital expenditures in 2023 as we expand both our international and U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investments and collaboration opportunities that will enable and complement our platform. We've recently announced several new transactions, and I'm happy to report that we have successfully closed our acquisition of OriCiro Genomics in the first quarter of 2023. OriCiro is a great example of the companies we are evaluating to enable our mRNA platform. It will create substantial value from both the speed and cost viewpoint and impact our pre-clinical, clinical and commercial pipeline for years to come.\nOur collaboration with LifeEdit, which we announced yesterday, is another example for an attractive external investment opportunity. We believe the combination of Moderna's mRNA platform with LifeEdit's proprietary gene editing technologies, including base editing capabilities, has the opportunity to advance potentially life transformative or curative therapies for some of the most challenging genetic diseases.\nWe are in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities, and we will be disciplined in our approach.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. In 2022, we repurchased 23 million shares for $3.3 billion at an average price of $143 per share. And we have $2.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.\nNow, let's turn to our 2023 financial framework on Slide 33. As Arpa mentioned earlier, we currently have COVID vaccine sales of $5 billion contracted for delivery in 2023. Also, we are actively working on preparing for the private market and government contracts in the U.S. and additional contracts for Europe, Japan and other key markets.\nTo help you with your modeling purposes, we expect first half '23 sales to be approximately $2 billion. Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties, as well as logistics and warehousing costs. We expect full year 2023 reported cost of sales to be 35% to 40% of sales. This includes royalties of approximately 5% of sales, which are payable to UPenn and CellScript for modified chemistry licenses, and to NIAID and NIH for the 2P license that I mentioned earlier. The increase in cost of sales as a percent of product sales compared to 2022 is primarily driven by presentation mix change as we move from a pandemic to endemic setting, with single-dose application significantly increasing in volume.\nLonger term, as the endemic market normalizes and we add additional respiratory and other products, we expect our cost of sales as a percent of sales will significantly decrease in the rates we're experiencing in 2023.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we expect full year expenses to be approximately $6 billion, with approximately $4.5 billion in R&D. The increase is driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scale up of our company. We expect a negligible provision for income tax in 2023. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. The increase is primarily due to investments in expanding our manufacturing footprint.\nThis concludes my remarks concerning our financial performance, and I will turn the call back over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, Arpa and Stephen. Let me now share some thoughts about where we're heading.\nI'm really excited to see our mRNA platform and the investments we have made in science over the last 11 years lead to such a promising pipeline. We anticipate a number of important developments.\nLet me start with our first franchise, respiratory vaccines. In COVID boosters, we are working for the switch to U.S. commercial market, and we anticipate being able to quickly meet the full 2023 market needs for updated vaccines after VRBPAC and the FDA make this transaction in the spring of 2023. We plan to submit RSV vaccine for regulatory approval in the first half of 2023, and as you heard from Arpa, we'll be ready to launch the RSV vaccine in late '23 or early '24.\nIn flu vaccine, for Northern Hemisphere, mRNA-1010 Phase III trial, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board is expected to complete its interim efficacy analysis in the first quarter of 2023. Our second franchise Latent virus vaccine. It's progressing very well with a broad spectrum of programs. In our large CMV Phase III study, we look to complete the enrollment. For EBV, HIV and VZV programs, our next milestone will be Phase I data.\nTurning to Slide 37, let me review the milestone for mRNA therapeutics programs. For personalized cancer treatment, we expect to start our Phase III study in partnership with Merck in adjuvant melanoma, and we expect to rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Full Phase II data will be presented at an upcoming oncology meeting and published in a top quality medical job.\nIn PA, we plan to select those and begin the expansion arm of our Phase I/II study.\nMMA, we will have Phase I/II data. The next milestone for heart failure for Relaxin will be Phase I data in patients. In Inhaled therapeutics, our partner Vertex expects to complete its single ascending dose study and initiate a multiple ascending dose study.\nTo continue to build the best version of Moderna, we have established 7 priorities for 2023. Priority number one, execute the operational and sales plan for COVID booster for fall of '23. Priority #2, build an unrivaled seasonal respiratory vaccine franchise. Priority #three, execute a bold campaign of cancer vaccine studies. Priority #4, advance rare metabolic disease programs. Priority #5, drive rapid advancement and growth of our latent vaccine portfolio. Priority #6, deliver the next-generation pipeline and platform. As we said before, this is just the beginning. And Priority #7, build a culture of perpetual learning and strengthen our processes and digital system as we want to scale the company to another level.\nOn Slide 39, some key dates for 2023 Moderna Investor Days. April 11 will be our Annual Vaccine Day. September 13 will be Annual R&D Day, where we'll present development pipeline key updates. And December 7 will be our second ESG Day.\nNow that we have delivered on the promise of mRNA science with our first product launched, our mission has evolved. Our mission is to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicine. We are passionate about our ability to have a profound impact on humanity. We believe we have the technology to eliminate or greatly reduce human suffering caused by respiratory viruses, latent viruses, many cancers, (inaudible) diseases and the growing list of other diseases. We believe we can have an impact on these treatments with our therapeutic first and then with our clean editing programs. This is just the beginning. With that, the team and I are happy to now take your questions. Operator.",

My name is Kevin, and welcome to Moderna's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised, this call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna. Please proceed.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results and Business Updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamie Mock, our Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will take your questions through 9:15 a.m. this morning.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our Q3 2022 conference call. Today, I will start with a quick business review of the quarter before Stephen reviews our clinical programs. Arpa will then take you through commercial dynamics, and Jamie will present financials. I will then come back to close before we take your questions.\nIn the quarter, we reported $3.4 billion in revenues. We reported net income of $1 billion and cash investments totaling $17 billion. We now expect deliveries under advanced purchase agreements in the range of $18 billion to $19 billion in 2022 due to delayed deliveries from our Fill/Finish contract manufacturers, resulting in $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue deferrals into 2023.\nIn Q3, we had to deal with a lot of complexity, launching 2 products, 1273.214 and 1273.222 at the same time and also moving products from 10-dose vials to 5-dose vials. Q3 was actually our greater delivery amount in terms of vials produced and was up about 20%, the average of the previous 3 quarters. Arpa will share more thoughts on 2023 in a moment.\nIn the third quarter, we repurchased over 7 million shares. The $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in February 2022 was completed. Since the start of our first share repurchase program in 2021 through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased more than 23 million shares. Our first share repurchase program announced in August 2022 for an additional $3 billion in repurchase is ongoing.\nLet me now review the pipeline highlights and advances since our last update. I am very pleased with the important progress the Moderna team has made on advancing the pipeline closer to product launches, and at the same time, increasing the breadth of the pipeline. We continue to progress with COVID booster programs and have received authorization around the world for both of COVID 1273.214 program which target Omicron BA.1 and 1273.222, which target BA.4/5.\nWe have, as you know, two respiratory vaccines in Phase III trials as we speak that continue to progress quickly.\nFor flu vaccine, at R&D in September, we announced the first Phase III immunogenicity study was fully enrolled. We expect now data in the first quarter of 2023. As a reminder, we plan to pursue an accelerated approval pathway for seasonal flu vaccine. We also started a Phase III efficacy study with a flu vaccine, and that trial is enrolling quickly.\nFor Phase III [allergy] vaccine, we are on track for data readout this winter season. We were pleased to announce that Merck exercised their option to develop and commercialize our personal cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, paying more than $250 million in Q4. We and Merck will share costs and profit 50-50 for this program moving forward. We continue to expect data from our Phase II study for PCV in Q4 this year.\nIn rare diseases, we are pleased to share at the R&D Day that we saw encouraging early signs of clinical benefit from both PA and GSD1a and announced a new development candidate for OTC.\nOn Slide 6, you see our usual snapshot of Moderna in November 2022, showing the breadth of the pipeline, with now 48 programs in development across vaccines and therapeutics. The company continues to grow and we are now at more than 3,700 Moderna team members.\nLast week, we are very pleased to announce as a top employer by science for the eighth consecutive year. We have now 15 commercial subsidiaries globally and a strong balance sheet of $17 billion to fund our continued growth. With this, I will now turn over to Stephen to review the pipeline. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stéphane. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. This morning, I'll review our clinical progress. We've launched 2 vaccine boosters for the current fall/winter season to meet different market demands and have received authorizations or approvals worldwide for these vaccines. We previously shared that 1273.214, which targets Omicron BA.1 induced significantly higher titers than 1273 against the BA.1 and BA.4/5 sublineages in the clinical trial. And mRNA-1273.214 is now authorized in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, European Union, Japan and other countries.\nFor mRNA-1273.222, which targets the Omicron BA.4/5 variants, the Phase II/III study is ongoing, and we expect data later this quarter. MRNA-1273.222 is authorized in the United States and now also in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan and other countries.\nNow moving to Slide 9. I'll review our respiratory vaccines pipeline. I will cover the Phase III studies in detail on the next slide. Here, I want to highlight the progress in the earlier-stage studies with our respiratory vaccines. MRNA-1020, 10.30 for seasonal influenza is in a Phase I/II study and is now fully enrolled. MRNA 1345 for RSV in the pediatric population is now fully enrolled in a Phase I study.\nMoving now to our combination respiratory pipeline, where we have made meaningful progress, mRNA-1073, our combination vaccine for COVID and flu, is in Phase I/II and is fully enrolled. I'm very pleased to announce that our combination COVID, flu and RSV vaccine, or mRNA-1230, has also started enrolling in its Phase I/II study. We announced a new development candidate, mRNA-1045, this one targeting combination of RSV and influenza, and that has started in its Phase I/II study.\nAnd lastly, in our combination vaccine pipeline, we also have a pediatric vaccine covering hMPV and PIV3 that study is ongoing in the fully enrolled Phase Ib study.\nFinally, our endemic human coronavirus vaccine is in preclinical development, along with our pediatric RSV, HMPV combination vaccine.\nNow to review our Phase III flu and RSV programs on Slide 10. For flu, our Phase III immunogenicity study in the Southern Hemisphere is fully enrolled with 6,000 participants with the data readout expected in the first quarter of 2023. As we've previously noted, regulators have indicated support for an accelerated approval pathway for our seasonal flu vaccine candidate, pending the study -- the results from this study. We've also started enrolling our Phase III efficacy study in the Northern Hemisphere and have now enrolled more than 10,000 participants. Timing of this confirmatory Phase III efficacy readout will be driven by flu case accruals in the study and could come as early as this winter.\nLooking to RSV. Our pivotal Phase III efficacy study in older adults has now enrolled more than 35,000 participants. As we previously mentioned, our primary endpoints in this study are safety and vaccine efficacy. Timing of the Phase III efficacy readout will be driven by RSV case accruals in that study. As we're now in the midst of a very strong RSV season, we continue to expect that the result will be available this winter season.\nMoving on to our latent and public health vaccine portfolio. Our CMV vaccine is ongoing in a Phase III study. Our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis is in a Phase I study, while our EBV vaccine to prevent longer-term sequelae such as cancer and multiple sclerosis is in preclinical.\nWe have 2 HIV Phase I trials ongoing, and our HSV and VZV vaccines are in ongoing preclinical studies. Finally, our public health vaccine for Zika is ongoing in a Phase II trial and our Nipah vaccine is ongoing in a Phase I study.\nNow let's take a look at our therapeutics pipeline on Slide 12. First, I want to note that AstraZeneca notified us that after a portfolio review, they are returning the rights to the IL-12 program to us. They are concluding the Phase I study, and we will then evaluate next steps for the program for ourselves.\nSecond, we're excited that our checkpoint vaccine has started dosing its first patient in a Phase I study. And finally, our partner, Vertex, expects to submit an IND for our mRNA cystic fibrosis program by the end of this year. We recently shared updates on our personalized cancer vaccine, PA and GSD1a programs at our latest R&D day and I will talk to those in more detail in the upcoming slides.\nNow recall at R&D Day that we shared data from 2 rare disease programs. The first is in our propionic acidemia program, which is a multi-dose study. And as of September, we had accrued 6 patient years of experience on the drug and administered well over 100 doses. It has generally been well tolerated, which is encouraging. We've also seen an encouraging trend in the reduction of biomarkers and been observing a numerical decrease in the frequency of metabolic decompensation events, which is also really encouraging given the severity of these events for propionic acidemia patients.\nIn the GSD1a program, we shared an early set of data from the first 2 patients in the first cohort. The study is a single ascending dose study that runs a fasting challenge in a controlled and safe environment in patients with GSD1a who are unable to normally fast or go without food for long periods of time without becoming hypoglycemic. Both patients in the first cohort have demonstrated that mRNA-3745 was well tolerated and showed an extension of fast duration and normalization of key biomarkers, including glucose, which we think is very encouraging signal of activity.\nTo close, I wanted to remind everyone that we expect our Phase II results from our personalized cancer therapeutic by the end of the year. The randomized study comparing PCV plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone enrolled approximately 150 resected melanoma patients with a high risk of recurrence. The primary endpoint is to prevent is recurrence-free survival.\nAs Stéphane mentioned earlier, our partner, Merck exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize mRNA-4157, and we look forward to sharing that data this quarter. With that, I will hand it over to Arpa.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good day to everyone. I will start with a review of sales on Slide 16. Sales to the U.S. were $1 billion in the third quarter and were mainly from deliveries of mRNA-1273.222, our bivalent booster targeting Omicron BA.4/5. Sales to Europe of mRNA-1273.214 were also $1 billion and the rest of the world totaled $1.1 billion. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, U.S. sales were $3.4 billion, sales to Europe were $4.5 billion and sales to the rest of the world accounted for $5.7 billion.\nIn both the 3- and 9-month periods, we saw geographical diversification of sales across these key regions.\nWe recognize there are questions regarding the 2023 market and long-term COVID booster potential and we wanted to walk you through how we are thinking about it. As we transition into an endemic market, there are important factors we considered in our commercial outlook. These include the ongoing medical need for COVID boosters and the potential size of the annual booster market. We use the seasonal flu market to frame the opportunity, and I will take you through our thinking on that in the next couple of slides. I will also detail some of the factors underlying the transition to the commercial market in the U.S. in 2023. I'll then wrap up the COVID section with an overview of our currently signed contracts and our outlook for additional expected contracts in 2023. Finally, I'll close with a reminder of what's coming in 2023 from our respiratory vaccine franchise a potential launch timings that we shared recently at our R&D Day in September.\nSo starting with the medical need for COVID boosters, the chart on Slide 18 compares hospitalizations and deaths associated with the seasonal flu and COVID over a relevant time period. For flu, we looked back at the past 10 influenza seasons in the U.S. before COVID-related interventions disrupted the typical flu season. And for COVID, we looked at hospitalizations and deaths from October 2021 to September 2022, which covers the period of widespread immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants either through vaccination or infection. We believe this period is a close proxy to what population immunity to COVID could be in an endemic season.\nAs you can see here on the chart, hospitalizations due to COVID during the past 12 months are 3x higher than the 2017, 2018 flu season, which represents the year with the highest medical burden within the 10-year period included in the analysis. And the deaths due to COVID are even higher, coming in at a rate of 7x higher than the same severe flu season. This comparison shows the higher medical burden of COVID in a period that we believe more closely approximates an endemic season and underscores the need for boosters in the endemic phase. It also helps frame the potential endemic annual COVID market, which I want to take you through on the next slide.\nTo size the endemic COVID booster market, we start with the flu market volumes. Volume in the annual flu market is approximately 500 million to 600 million doses around the world. The size of the market is highly dependent on the number of doses as well as global price as shown in the sensitivity table on the left-hand side of the slide. The prices shown here are purely illustrative to demonstrate a range of outcomes on global pricing. Ultimately, global price for COVID boosters will reflect sales mix and differential pricing across markets.\nOur endemic pricing will be focused on the value that the vaccine brings to health care systems around the world.\nAs we move to an endemic market in 2023, key factors that will impact our volume in the year include the medical need, ongoing viral evolution, recommendations from public health authorities and consumer motivation to vaccinate. So while we believe that volumes in the global endemic COVID market should approximate to at least 600 million doses over time, we believe it is too early to reliably predict the variables impacting the volume of doses in 2023.\nTurning to Slide 20 and specifically addressing the transition to the commercial market in the U.S. We anticipate a more fragmented customer base, including private payers, health plans, pharmacy chains, individual pharmacies and physician offices. We also anticipate reduced predictability in orders, seasonality of deliveries similar to flu vaccine deliveries, a shift to full distribution costs assumed by Moderna as well as other major factors in the U.S. such as shifting to a single dose presentation and continued innovation and product differentiation.\nMoving on to Slide 21, we summarize the contracts that have been signed so far for 2023. We had advanced purchase agreements for the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Taiwan and Kuwait, totaling $2.5 billion. Additionally, we expect deferrals of $2 billion to $3 billion from 2022. These deferrals are from the countries listed on the slide. Together, these advanced purchase agreements and deferrals totaled $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in sales for 2023.\nFinally and very importantly, we have a number of countries where we expect additional 2023 contracts to be signed. We are working to secure 23 orders in the U.S., EU, Japan, Australia, Asia, Latin America and COVAX. And we expect to have visibility into these orders as contracting season begins later this quarter and continuing into next year.\nSo to summarize the COVID outlook on Slide 22, with the continued higher medical burden of COVID relative to flu, we expect the endemic COVID vaccine market could be as large or larger than flu market volumes over time. The U.S. market is transitioning to a commercial market and we believe we are well-positioned to serve its evolving needs. And finally, we have established a base of confirmed contracts of $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in 2023, to which we anticipate adding a number of important orders in the months ahead from key markets, including the U.S., EU, Japan and others.\nNow before I close, I'm excited to review the formation of our respiratory vaccine franchise that we highlighted during our R&D Day in September. As early as next year, we could be expanding into flu and RSV. And as we look at flu and RSV, combined with COVID, they lead to more deaths annually than Alzheimer's, stroke or diabetes in developed markets. As Stephen highlighted, depending on case accruals and vaccine efficacy, we could see data from our flu and RSV Phase III trials this winter. We are actively preparing for the commercial launches for these additional respiratory vaccines and will leverage the COVID commercial infrastructure that we are currently building. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie.\n\nJames M. Mock\n\nCFO, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Arpa, and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. After 2 months at Moderna, I am even more excited about our company's future and the role we are playing in bringing a new generation of medicines to patients. For those of you whom I haven't had the pleasure of meeting yet, I look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead.\nToday, I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and capital allocation priorities and finish with the view on the key drivers on our remaining 2022 financial performance.\nTurning now to Slide 25. Total product sales in the quarter of $3.1 billion decreased 35% year-over-year. The decrease was driven by lower sales volumes due to the timing of market authorizations, for our updated COVID-19 booster vaccines and the related manufacturing ramp-up with our CMO partners. As a reminder, we received the marketing authorization for the U.S. on August 31, for the European Union on September 2, and Japan on September 12.\nWe anticipate that product sales will be higher in the fourth quarter of 2022 than in the third quarter as we continue to deliver against our supply contracts for booster vaccines. Cost of sales was 35% of product sales compared to 15% of product sales last year. This includes a charge of $333 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 products and expense for unutilized manufacturing capacity of $209 million and a loss on firm purchase commitments and related cancellation charges of $102 million. These charges are driven by a shift in product demand to our Omicron-targeting COVID-19 bivalent boosters and costs associated with surplus production capacity.\nResearch and development expenses were $820 million, an increase of 57% versus the prior year. The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by our increasing and maturing pipeline, including Phase III studies for RSV, flu, CMV and COVID boosters.\nSelling, general and administration expenses of $278 million increased by 65% year-over-year. The growth in spending was driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated commercial and overall company build-out.\nThe effective tax rate of 14% compared to 6% last year. As a reminder, we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020, which resulted in a nonrecurring benefit to the reported tax rate in 2021.\nAfter-tax net income decreased by 69% to $1 billion. Diluted EPS in Q3 2022 decreased by 67% to $2.53. As a result of our share buyback activities, the diluted weighted average share count reduced by 22 million shares to 412 million shares as of the end of Q3 2022 compared to 434 million shares the prior year.\nTurning now to the year-to-date financial results on Slide 26. Total product sales for the first 9 months of 2022 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year. The growth was mainly attributable to a favorable customer mix and higher manufacturing capacity to fulfill customer demand for the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. Cost of sales was 26% of product sales compared to 16% of product sales last year. The increase was driven by substantial demand reduction from COVAX, as mentioned in our Q2 earnings call, a shift in demand to our Omicron-targeting COVID-19 bivalent boosters and costs associated with surplus production capacity.\nAfter-tax net income was $6.9 billion, a decrease of 6% versus prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher cost of sales, higher other operating expenses and a higher tax rate. Diluted EPS decreased by 3% to $16.46.\nTurning to cash and cash deposits on Slide 27. We ended Q3 2022 with cash and investments of $17 billion compared to $18.1 billion at the end of the second quarter. The decrease reflects the share buyback in Q3 of $1 billion and a federal tax payment of $0.8 billion. The ending balance of cash deposits for future product supply at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion.\nNow turning to Slide 28. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. R&D spending was $2.1 billion in the year-to-date September period, a 55% year-over-year increase. We continue to be excited about our mRNA platform and now have 48 development programs with multiple ongoing studies now in Phase III.\nWe increased our year-to-date capital expenditures by 88% year-over-year to $308 million as we expand our manufacturing footprint. We also continue to invest in our commercial and digital capabilities, as well as the overall company build-out. Our second investment priority is to seek attractive external investments and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technologies and capabilities.\nWe are considering attractive opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments. We are in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities.\nThen after evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional usage of cash. In the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased 7 million shares for $1 billion. Year-to-date through September 30, we repurchased 20 million shares for $2.9 billion. In October, we completed the $3 billion authorization approved in February 2022 and began to utilize the additional $3 billion August authorization.\nNow let's turn to our 2022 updated financial framework on Slide 29. We now expect delivery in 2022 against signed advanced purchase agreements of $18 billion to $19 billion, reflecting deferrals of $2 billion to $3 billion into 2023 due to short-term supply chain constraints. This total includes expected negative foreign exchange impacts compared to the contract value at signing, which we estimate to be approximately 1.5% of sales for the full-year 2022, assuming current exchange rates remain through the year-end. Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. We now expect our full-year 2022 reported cost of sales to be in the 26 to 28 percentage range, driven by the previously mentioned cost incurred year-to-date, a range on our Q4 volume and potentially further charges due to product updates.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we continue to expect full-year expenses to be approximately $4 billion, driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scale-up of our company. Based on current tax laws, we continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens as a result of benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income driven by our international business mix and stock-based compensation deduction.\nFinally, regarding capital expenditures, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $0.5 billion, slightly below the previous range of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion driven by the timing of project completion. This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I will turn the call back over to Stéphane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamie, Arpa and Stephen for this update. Before opening to Q&A, I just want to review some of the key priorities as we close out this year and look into 2023. For the remainder of the year, we'll continue to focus on delivering our updated Omicron boosters and drive 2022 sales. We're already working on 2023 sales contract in Europe, Japan and U.S. from afar around the world. Arpa and our team are also setting up with the U.S. team and scaling it so that we can go private in the U.S. market in 2023.\nWe continue to execute on our pipeline. We look forward to be able to present when we have it, the Phase II data of PCV expected before the end of the year. The team has done a great job to continue to enroll our Phase III study for flu and RSV and CMV and I'm excited to see the advancement of our rare disease programs.\nLooking to next year, Arpa and the team and the entire organization, including manufacturing, is preparing for multiple vaccine launches in the year including commercial COVID market as well as potential for our therapic programs to move very quickly in Phase III.\nAnd finally, we hope that many of you can join us next week for our first ESG Day on November 10. The virtual event will be available from our webcast. With this, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?",

Welcome to Moderna's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that this call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations at Moderna. Please proceed.\n\nLavina Talukdar\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's second quarter 2022 financial results and business update. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.\nOn today's call are Stephane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Paul Burton, our Chief Medical Officer; and Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2022 conference call. Today, I will start with a quick business review before Paul walks you through some new real-world evidence data on Spikevax. And then Stephen will review our clinical programs. Arpa will take you through commercial dynamics, and David will present financials. I will then come back to close, share some thoughts about where we're heading.\nIn the quarter, we continued strong financial performance. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion and net income of $2.2 billion. We were pleased with the Q2 sales. The decrease in net income is driven by higher cost of sales in the quarter, mostly driven by our COVAX contract, David will call that in the financials; a strong increase in R&D investments to fund our future, including the 4 Phase III programs; and the higher tax rate than Q2 2021.\nThrough our share repurchase program, we reduced our share count by 9 million shares in Q2. Since the start of our first share repurchase program in 2021 through yesterday, we have repurchased around 18 million shares. We continue to have signed advanced purchase agreement for expected delivery in 2022 in the amount of approximately $21 billion.\nBased on our commercial momentum and our balance sheet, today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a new share buyback program for an additional $3 billion.\nLet me now review the business and pipeline update since our last review. I am pleased with the important progress the Moderna team has made on advancing the pipeline closer to product launches and increasing the breadth of the pipeline.\nOn the commercial side, we recently signed a new agreement with the U.S. government for an initial 66 million doses for bivalent booster vaccine against Omicron. The agreement also includes options to purchase an additional 234 million doses, putting the total sales potentially up 400 million doses. The U.S. government has already exercised option for an additional 4 million doses since the contract was signed and announced. So the current total is actually 70 million doses contracted for the fall of 2022 with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, both Canada and the U.K. had exercised options for their current agreements for additional deliveries in 2022.\nOn the regulatory front, I am very happy to have Spikevax authorized for pediatric and adolescent population in the U.S. This (inaudible) efforts with regulatory clinical teams at Moderna and the U.S. FDA allows the protection of the young in the U.S. population as they head back to school.\nHealth Canada and Australia have also authorized the use of vaccine for children 6 months to 5 years old.\nOur research and clinical team continued the momentum in our pipeline. We have 4 programs in Phase III development with COVID bivalent booster, flu, RSV and CMV trials ongoing. Importantly, our Phase I study with mRNA-1020/1030 of 2 vaccines targeting the traditional flu antigen as well as the novel antigen is now fully enrolled. And our combination flu plus COVID vaccine is also fully enrolled for its Phase I/II. We look forward to this readout on safety and immunogenecity for our programs.\nIn properties, we now have an open IND with our checkpoint vaccine in oncology, and we dosed our first patients with our GSDA1 rare disease program.\nFinally, we are very pleased to be on track and look forward to sharing data for our proof-of-concept studies this year for 2 operative programs. The Phase I/II for a rare disease program, propionic acidemia or PA and our Phase II data with our personalized cancer vaccine in combination to KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy.\nSlide 6 is our usual snapshot of Moderna in August 2022, showing the breadth of the pipeline with 46 program development across vaccine but also therapeutics. The company has a strong foundation. We run a 3,400 teams and growing, 11 commercial subsidiary and a strong balance sheet with around $18 billion of cash to fuel our growth.\nI will now hand it over to Paul.\n\nPaul Burton\n\nChief Medical Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephane, and good day, everyone. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the SARS-CoV-2 virus keeps undergoing significant evolutionary change, the subject top of mind for many people is boosting, when to get boosted and what to get boosted with. In the next few slides, I want to show you how the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine is performing clinically in the booster setting and how antibody levels are performing in the real-world setting in individuals primed and boosted with mRNA vaccines.\nHere in this next slide, you see the rates of COVID-19 infection in over 3 million individuals in a Spanish National Registry. The first point this data make is that boosting is highly effective, reducing the risk of infection. The second point the authors make is that mRNA-1273, the Moderna vaccine, is more effective than BNT162b2 and that the effect size increases over time.\nIn the second example, I'm showing you data from the U.S. VA system in over 450,000 individuals boosted with either mRNA-1273 shown here in green or BNT162b2 shown in red. Again, in terms of infection or hospitalization prevention, the authors conclude that mRNA-1273 is more effective than the alternate mRNA vaccine.\nFinally, here are data from over 3 million individuals in the NHS England database, again, showing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 infection and hospitalization with mRNA-1273 boosting compared to BNT162b2 during the Omicron period of infection.\nI want to turn now to data from an innovative, decentralized, pragmatic, real-world study we have recently conducted within the Moderna community, a collaborative platform with Evidation of over 100,000 participants here in the United States. The study is called disCOVEries, and it enrolled approximately 850 of these people into a real-world assessment of antibody levels, following primary vaccination and boosting with either Moderna-Moderna-Moderna, that's the MMM group, or Pfizer-Pfizer-Pfizer, that's the PPP group. Importantly, the study population has an average age of 44. Approximately 60% of the participants are female, and it's ethnically very diverse. Participants were enrolled into the study, consented and received a home self-administered microneedle blood collection kit from your buyer.\nAs you can see here across an array of SARS-CoV-2 variance of concern, higher and more durable antibody levels shown here on a logarithmic Y-axis scale were observed in those individuals primed and boosted with the Moderna vaccine in red relative to the Pfizer vaccine in blue from 8 weeks through 32 weeks following their first booster. Many of the comparisons were highly statistically significantly different. It's true, even for antibody levels against the Omicron BA.1 variant of concern, where an approximately 12-week duration advantage is seen in Moderna prime and boosted individuals compared to those receiving the Pfizer vaccine.\nSo taken together, these data demonstrate the strong performance of the Moderna vaccine in a real-world clinical boosting setting, which could be explained by higher enduring antibody levels against a wide variety of variants of concern.\nI will now turn the call over to Dr. Stephen Hoge to provide comments regarding the composition of the 4 COVID-19 booster vaccines as well as other pipeline updates. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I will quickly review some of the recent updates around our Omicron-containing COVID booster for the upcoming fall season, and then review the rest of our pipeline before handing it to Arpa.\nWe are advancing 2 bivalent candidates for the fall/winter season of 2022 to meet different market demands. MRNA-1273.214 is our Omicron BA.1-containing bivalent vaccine. Clinical data previously presented from our Phase II/III study showed that 214 significantly increased neutralizing titers against BA.4, BA.5 compared to the currently authorized booster. Following regulatory discussions, we have submitted application for authorization for 214 in the EU, Australia, U.K., Canada and Switzerland. We have also started a rolling submission in Japan.\nmRNA-1273.222 is our bivalent vaccine candidate that combines an Omicron-containing vaccine based on the BA.4, BA.5 subvariant and our original mRNA-1273. The FDA has asked us to submit for authorization for 222 based on the demonstrated strength of our bivalent platform against variants of concern, including data from our Phase II/III studies with 214 and 211 bivalent boosters. FDA has also advised manufacturers to initiate clinical trials with 222 as these data will serve useful as the pandemic continues to evolve. We expect to start this trial in August.\nNow to review our respiratory vaccine pipeline on Slide 16. I just went over our Omicron-containing COVID boosters. We were happy to announce that our flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, launched an immunogenicity study in the Southern Hemisphere in June. And we are also preparing to launch an efficacy study for mRNA-1010 this upcoming fall, which will either serve as a post-approval efficacy study or, if we are not eligible for accelerated approval, will support our application. Our next-generation flu vaccines, which have 8 mRNAs across HA and NA antigens, our mRNA-1020 and 1030, also completed enrollment in their Phase I/II study. Our RSV program is ongoing, including a Phase III in older adults and a Phase I in pediatrics.\nImportantly, we also started and completed enrollment for the Phase I/II study of our COVID + flu vaccine this quarter. We look forward to sharing that data when we have it.\nOur combination COVID + flu + RSV vaccine also expects to enter the clinic this year. Our endemic human coronavirus vaccine is in preclinical, along with our pediatric RSV + hMPV combination vaccine. And the pediatric hMPV + PIV3 vaccine Phase Ib is now fully enrolled.\nMoving on to our latent and public health vaccine portfolio. our CMV vaccine is ongoing in a Phase III. Our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis is in a Phase I study. And our EBV vaccine to prevent long-term sequelae from the virus is in preclinical. We have 2 HIV Phase I trials and a Phase II Zika vaccine trial that are all ongoing. Our phase -- our HSV and VZV vaccines are in preclinical. And finally, we dosed the first participants in our Phase I study of our Nipah vaccine, which is being conducted in partnership with the NIH.\nAnd to close on our therapeutics pipeline on Slide 18. Stephane already mentioned that we expect data from our proof-of-concept studies in our PCV and PA programs later this year. A few other important updates to highlight on this slide. First, we were happy to dose our first patient in our GSD1a trial and open an IND for our checkpoint cancer vaccine. Second, AstraZeneca notified us that after a portfolio review, they are returning the VEGF program and we are currently evaluating the next steps for that asset. Finally, based on a review of early clinical data from our IL-2 program for autoimmune disease and the evolving competitive landscape, we've decided to discontinue further development of our program and we'll remove it from our pipeline.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Arpa.\n\nArpa Garay\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephen. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. As the newest member of Moderna's Executive Committee, I'm excited to see the impact that we've had in COVID as well as the commercial opportunities ahead for us in COVID as well as future vaccines and therapeutics in the long run leveraging our mRNA technology.\nTurning now to Slide 20, where you will see the regional sales mix in second quarter and in the first half of 2022. In the quarter, North American sales were $1.6 billion. These sales were driven by 1273 booster deliveries to the United States as we continue to fulfill our first U.S. government order, with the vast majority now delivered through the end of second quarter this year. In the quarter, we also delivered primary series doses for the pediatric group 5 years and younger as the authorization for this group came through in this quarter.\nSales to EMEA were $1.5 billion, and sales to Asia Pacific were $1.1 billion. As you can see across the first 2 quarters of the year, North American sales were $2.7 billion, sales to EMEA were $3.9 billion and sales to Asia Pacific region were $3 billion. Of note, for both the 3- and 6-month periods, we saw a geographic diversification of sales across these key regions. This diversification is a reflection of how quickly we built out and executed within our global commercial organization.\nNow turning to Slide 21. We're also happy to see that as we continue to scale globally around the world that Spikevax's market share in the booster market, defined as a third or fourth booster dose, continues to show substantial market share.\nAs Stephane has already mentioned, we see on Slide 22 our new U.S. government contracts for the fall of 2022. Specifically, the agreement initially was for 66 million doses of our bivalent COVID booster to be delivered in 2022. Earlier this week, the U.S. government informed us that they exercised an option for 4 million doses for the pediatric age group. This brings the total contract value to approximately $1.8 billion. Our U.S. government order includes options to purchase an additional 230 million doses, bringing the total to 300 million doses if all options are exercised. As you heard from Stephen earlier, as per FDA guidance, the U.S. fall booster product will be the mRNa-1273.222, which consists of 1273 and the Omicron BA.4/5 subvariant.\nI'd like to now spend some time on the evolution of the pandemic and the resulting impact on the commercial outlook. Early in the pandemic, we anticipated several factors, including the virus' evolution, population immunity at any given time and seasonal trends, would result in a shift to the endemic setting. And we've shared this illustrative graph before. These same factors have and will continue to influence the commercial outlook.\nWith the emergence and then dominance of multiple variants at different time points, we have been able to develop boosters to address these variants, which includes our bivalent boosters against the Omicron variant. We are currently advancing 2 bivalent booster candidates for the fall of 2022 based on different market needs. The 2 bivalent booster candidates we're advancing are the mRNA-1273.214 and mRNa-1273.222. Both contain 25 micrograms of the currently authorized booster 1273 and 25 micrograms of an Omicron subvariant, either BA.1 or BA.4/5. Deliveries for these boosters will start in September this year and will be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter as we ramp manufacturing and obtain regulatory authorizations around the world.\nAnd to close, as we look to 2023, we are prepared for a shift to the commercial market in the U.S. for COVID boosters where the market will be more fragmented than it was during the pandemic where the U.S. government was the sole purchaser of vaccines. The commercial organization has already engaged with commercial payers and the channel, both channel distributors as well as key pharmacies, in anticipation of this shift. Internationally, we expect public health authorities to remain key purchasers of vaccines, but we are also identifying markets where there may be a private commercial market as well. All in all, we are well prepped for the transition as we have invested in building our commercial infrastructure, both in the U.S. and globally.\nWith that, I will turn it over to David.\n\nDavid W. Meline\n\nCFO, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Arpa. Today, we're providing the analysis of actual 2022 second quarter results along with a view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Overall, we continue to progress well, and I'm very pleased with our operational and commercial performance.\nTurning now to Slide 25, starting with an overview of our financial performance in the second quarter. Total product sales for the second quarter of 2022 of $4.5 billion increased by $334 million or 8% compared to the prior period. The total product sales growth in 2022 was primarily driven by higher average sale price of our COVID-19 vaccine due to changing customer mix. Total revenue was $4.7 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $395 million compared to Q2 of last year, driven by the increase of sales of our COVID-19 vaccine.\nCost of sales was $1.4 billion or 30% of product sales in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 18% of product sales for the same period in 2021. This includes a charge of $499 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 products, a loss on firm purchase commitments of $184 million and an expense for unutilized external manufacturing capacity of $131 million. These charges are driven by a substantial reduction of our expected deliveries to COVAX as indicated as a potential variable impacting our advanced purchase agreements in our last call and, to a lesser extent, by deferral of deliveries to other customers, particularly to the European Union in light of the expected upcoming launch of our updated bivalent vaccines.\nResearch and development expenses were $710 million for the second quarter of 2022, an increase by $289 million or 69% compared to the year ago period. The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by clinical trial expenses, particularly with our COVID-19 and RSV programs as well as personnel-related costs for our expanding and maturing development portfolio.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $211 million for the second quarter of 2022, increased by $90 million or 74% compared to the year ago period. The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out.\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was 11% compared to 9% for the same period in 2021. Let me remind you of the fact that we have a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020, which resulted in a nonrecurring benefit to the reported tax rate last year.\nAfter-tax net income in Q2 2022 decreased by $583 million or 21% to $2.2 billion compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to higher cost of sales and other operating expenses in the current period.\nDiluted EPS in Q2 2022 decreased by $1.22 or 19% to $5.24 a share, which is compared to the same period in 2021.\nTurning now to year-to-date financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 26. Total product sales for the first 6 months of 2022 were $10.5 billion, increased by $4.5 billion or 76% compared to the prior year period. The total sales growth in 2022 was mainly attributable to our manufacturing capacity ramp-up and, to a smaller extent, to a favorable customer mix resulting in increased average selling price.\nTotal revenue was $10.8 billion for the first 6 months of 2022 compared to $6.3 billion in the same period in 2021. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by the increase of sales of our COVID-19 vaccine outside of the U.S.\nCost of sales was $2.4 billion or 23% of product sales for the first 6 months of 2022. This compares to 16% of product sales in the prior year period on a reported basis or 19% adjusted for prelaunch inventory costs, which were expensed in 2020. The increase in cost of sales as a percent of product sales was mainly due to higher write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory expense and expenses related to future purchase commitments and unutilized external manufacturing capacity and, to a lesser extent, the lack of prelaunch inventory benefit that was realized in the first quarter of 2021.\nResearch and development expenses were $1.3 billion for the first 6 months of 2022, an increase of $442 million or 54% compared to the prior year. The increase in R&D spend continues to be driven by clinical trial expenses, personnel-related costs and outside services for expanding and maturing development portfolio including the development of our COVID-19 bivalent boosters.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $479 million for the first 6 months of 2022 increased by $281 million or 142% compared to the year ago period. The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally and support of the accelerated company build-out, including substantial investments in digital. Additionally, in Q1 2022, there was an initial upfront endowment of $50 million for the newly established Moderna Foundation.\nThe effective tax rate for the first 6 months was 13% compared to 7% for the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the benefit recorded in 2021 related to the release of the valuation allowance on the majority of our deferred tax assets.\nAfter-tax net income increased by $1.9 billion or 46% to $5.9 billion for the first 6 months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in net income was driven by the growth of our product sales.\nDiluted EPS for the first 6 months of 2022 increased by $4.55 or 49% to $13.85 compared with the same period in 2021.\nTurning now to cash and cash deposits on Slide 27. We ended Q2 2022 with cash and investments of $18.1 billion compared to $19.3 billion at the end of Q1 of this year. The decrease reflects the share repurchase activities in Q2 of $1.3 billion. The ending balance of cash deposits for future product supply was $4.1 billion compared to $5.3 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The reduction quarter-over-quarter is driven by product deliveries against customer deposits.\nNow turning to Slide 28. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. As previously stated, R&D spending was $1.3 billion in the first half of 2022, a 54% increase on a year-over-year basis. We remain on track with our full year R&D forecast of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technology and capabilities. We are considering attractive opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments. We're in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. In the second quarter of 2022, we repurchased 9 million shares for $1.3 billion. Since inception of our repurchase activities last year up until August 2, we have purchased 18 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding diluted shares for $3 billion in total.\nAs a reminder, we announced a share repurchase program for $3 billion in February of this year and currently have approximately $1 billion of remaining capacity from that authorization. As part of today's press release, we announced that the Board has authorized an additional share buyback program of $3 billion with no expiry.\nNow let's turn to our 2022 updated financial framework on Page 29. We continue to have signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2022 in the amount of approximately $21 billion. This includes expected sales from the recently announced new agreement with the U.S. government. And an adjustment for doses that remain unallocated by COVAX due to lack of demand, we indicated this was a possibility on our last call.\nFurthermore, this total includes expected negative foreign exchange impacts compared to the contract value at signing, which we estimate to be approximately 1.5% of sales for the full year 2022, assuming current rates remain through year-end. We anticipate that for sales in the second half of 2022, sales will be greater in the fourth quarter than the third quarter driven by the timing of anticipated approval of our updated COVID-19 vaccines and the related manufacturing ramp-up of the new products.\nOur total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufacturer, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. We now expect our full year 2022 reported cost of sales to be in the mid-20% range, driven by the previously mentioned costs related to a reduction of doses to COVAX and deferral of doses to other customers. Cost of sales could increase to the high 20 percentage range in the event of further charges due to product updates.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4 billion, driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scaleup of the company. Based on current tax laws, we now expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teen range as a result of the benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income driven by our international business mix as well as stock-based compensation reductions.\nFinally, regarding capital expenditures, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion as we further build out our manufacturing and general company infrastructure globally.\nThis concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I turn the call back over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, Arpa, Stephen and Paul, for those updates.\nIn 2022, we set out to execute on 5 key priorities: First, to execute on delivering vaccine against $21 billion of signed advanced purchase agreement. With half of the year behind us and the signed deals for the fall of 2022 and our strong manufacturing team, we are on target.\nWe have continued the momentum in our late-stage clinical trials with our Phase III trials now in flu, RSV and CMV, and I thank our team for delivering on such aggressive time lines.\nWe are on track to share data from proof-of-concept studies from 2 therapeutic applications of our technology with data for our PA and PCV trial in second half. We have continued to make progress with new development candidates in vaccine and therapeutics. Some have already been announced and more will come in the second half of the year.\nAnd finally, the recent announcement of our inhaled LNP with our partner Vertex, we've expanded our mRNA platform to target preliminary disease.\nAs we grow, we are committed to doing the right things in the right way for patients and our stakeholders. As a company led by a founding team, we are thinking in 5-, 10-, 20-year increments.\nTo that end, this year, we'll publish our very first ESG report, which highlights the key pillars of our corporate responsibility framework, medicine for patients, our employees, the environment, our community and, of course, governance. I'm proud of what we are doing initially at this pillar and so proud of the ambitious goals we set for ourselves. I believe that the first steps to achieving those ambitious goal is to set them, to create and foster a purpose-driven culture and governance framework to meet those goals.\nAs an example, our goal of a net zero carbon emission globally by 2030, we put Moderna among the global leaders in promoting long-term sustainable growth for our planet and our organization. We will share more detail on our ESG journey at our ESG Day on November 10. But first, we look forward to hosting you at our Annual Day of September 8.\nModerna's mission to deliver on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of transformative medicine for patients has always been our North Star. Despite the challenges in the financial market with concern on inflation and ensuing increase in interest rates and the cost of capital, Moderna is in a very fortunate position.\nWe have a unique mRNA platform, enabling the generation at unprecedented speed of innovative medicine. We have a strong team of 3,400 mission-driven employees. We have $18 billion of cash on our balance sheet and with a strong commercial momentum. We have no intention of slowing down our growth. We are putting our head down and doing the work. I have never been as excited about the future of Moderna. Now is not the time to slow down, patients are waiting for innovative medicine.\nThank you for listening, and now we'll be happy to take questions. Operator?",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's first quarter 2022 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website. On today's call are Stephane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; and Paul Burton, our Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nI will now turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lavina. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 2022 conference call. Today, I will start by a quick business review of the quarter before Paul walks you through an update on Spikevax real-world evidence, and then Stephen reviews our clinical programs. David will then present the key financials, and I will then come back to conclude before we take your questions.\nI'm happy to share that the team delivered strong financial results this quarter. Revenues of $6.1 billion, GAAP net income of $3.7 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $8.58. We ended Q1 with a cash balance of $19.3 billion. For our share buyback program, we continue to retire shares in Q1 like we already did in Q4. David will share some numbers on share count in a few minutes.\nFor 2022, we are reiterating $21 billion in signed advanced purchase agreements. We have previously shared market share increases seen in the OECD countries with Spikevax when supply was no longer limited and when real-world publications highlighted differentiating data amongst the market vaccine. I'm happy to share that our market share has increased or still consistent across OECD countries.\nWhile a subset of our team is focused on delivering on the $21 billion signed APAs for fiscal year 2022, another subset of our team is focused on preparing the next wave of product launches. With our flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, plans to start a Phase III study in Q2 in the Southern Hemisphere, Moderna will have very soon 4 vaccine candidates in Phase III. An Omicron containing bivalent COVID booster, a flu booster, an RSV booster and the CMV vaccine.\nStarting with our Omicron containing bivalent COVID booster, mRNA-1273.214, we could see up to 3 respiratory vaccine launches from the fall of 2022 over the next 2 to 3 years. We believe each of these 4 vaccine candidates in Phase III could have multibillion-dollar annual peak sales. And because they all use the exact same mRNA technology as our approved vaccine, Spikevax, we believe this pro-vaccine candidate in late-stage clinical trials have a high probability of success.\nIn addition to our 4 late-stage vaccine, we continue to expand the applications of mRNA technology beyond vaccines. We should have important proof-of-concept data in patients in 2 of our therapeutic modalities later this year. Propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia in our rare genetic business portfolio, and the personalized cancer vaccine.\nSlide 7 shows the continued growth of Moderna. We now have 46 development programs in the pipeline. The organization has continued to grow to 3,200 team members.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Paul to review real-world evidence studies of our COVID booster. Paul?\n\nPaul Burton\n\nChief Medical Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephane, and hello, everyone. While there continues to be many studies posted and published on our mRNA vaccine, I would like to highlight some data today on vaccine boosting. But first, it's important to understand why booster vaccines are so critical as we transition through the COVID-19 pandemic and the understanding that we need to have about the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nOn Slide 9, we can see the change in COVID-19 cases over time, with the massive rise we observed due to Omicron in the last weeks of 2021 in the early part of 2022. The Omicron wave was caused by BA.1. And while that was certainly the dominant version of SARS-CoV-2 at that time, remarkably, BA.1 is now almost extinct here in the United States and around the world having been replaced by new subvariants. This continues to demonstrate the remarkable evolutionary capacity of this virus.\nBA.2 is now the dominant strain in the in the United States, with another subvariant of that BA.2.12.1 increasing rapidly, showing enhanced transmissibility. While BA.2 is dominant today, that increased transmissibility and infectivity of BA.2.12.1 is likely going to ensure it will be the dominant circulating strain very soon as we are seeing in New York and in the Northeast of the United States. Other new subvariants BA.4, BA.5, seen in South Africa, have also been detected in the United States, and we will need to carefully monitor their growth trajectories and pathogenicity.\nThe slowing of booster uptake now means there will be individuals who are undervaccinated and underprotected as we move into late spring and summer when we thought we would have declining case counts and balance, which could now be impacted by BA.2.12.1, BA.4 or BA.5. The speed and breadth of evolution of this virus that we see so clearly again today underpins our prediction for the global need for a varied adapted booster campaign this coming fall.\nThe good news is that a booster of vaccine protects against both BA.1 and BA.2. This is seen clearly when we look at data from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency. This graph looks at vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease for people who received the Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine for their primary vaccination on the left. You can see that against both BA.1, Omicron and BA.2, vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. But a booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines increases vaccine effectiveness and protection, as you can see on the right.\nThese 2 vaccines are combined together in this analysis. But again, even in this setting, there's gradual waning of vaccine effectiveness over time following boosting. This waning of vaccine effectiveness begs the question, will a second booster dose provide clinical utility and help to restore vaccine effectiveness and provide protection against COVID-19?\nWhile there are several examples of studies showing the high clinical effectiveness of additional boosting with the Moderna vaccine, on Slide 11, I want to highlight the results of a recent study from Ontario that looked at exactly this question and measured the effectiveness between a first and second booster vaccine dose in a high-risk population, those people living in long-term care facilities.\nA key finding from this study, which was conducted in over 55,000 individuals, was that indeed, a second boost of vaccination showed increased vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infections, symptomatic disease, and importantly, against severe outcomes in this high-risk setting. In fact, an increase in vaccine effectiveness was seen at 7 days from the second booster vaccination and continued to increase in effectiveness over time.\nTurning now to Slide 12. I would like to provide a perspective on who might gain particular benefit from annual vaccine boosting. There are many health, age-related and environmental occupational risk factors that lead to populations being at higher risk for COVID-19. First, age greater than 50 years. We know that hospitalization and mortality rates begin to increase steeply for those with COVID-19 who are over the age of 50.\nAnd then turning to people over the age of 18 that have other health risk factors, such as people with kidney disease, cancer, autoimmune disease and HIV patients, other health factors that either result in immunocompromise or place people at higher physiological risk for severe disease, if indeed, they are infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nFinally, environmental or occupational risk factors, such as health care workers, first responders, those in high-density housing or living conditions such as college students, military personnel or the incarcerated. We believe it is people in these broad categories who could benefit most from annual boosting for COVID-19.\nAnd so in summary, we've seen as we continue to anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to keep evolving rapidly with multiple new variants and recombinant variants circulating globally. Real-world evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of a booster shot, a third dose of mRNA-1273 against evolving variants of concern. And an additional booster, a fourth dose of mRNA-1273 shows incremental vaccine effectiveness when compared to a third dose against infection, symptomatic infection and severe disease in a high-risk population.\nWe believe people are at high risk due to health, age and environmental or occupational risk factors. And we believe that when taken together with the viral epidemiology and waning of protection, there is an important need for a variant-adapted booster vaccine and for boosting of populations this coming fall.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Stephen to take you through the progress in our clinical development pipeline. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Paul just shared with you the effectiveness of our booster mRNA-1273 against Omicron in the real-world setting. But on Slide 15, I'd like to pivot to our strategic rationale for why we think a seasonal booster will be necessary.\nSo first, we think neutralizing titers will wane similar to the endemic human coronaviruses. And that decline in neutralizing titers will increase their risk of breakthrough infection and hospitalization for those at higher risk, particularly as Paul just described, older adults or those with medical -- immunocompromised. The emergence of new variants of concern like the BA.4, .5 subvariants could accelerate the impact of that waning and broaden the risk of breakthrough across the population. So with that, we do believe a booster will be needed in the fall, and we're working hard to make improvements to our available boosters.\nThe desired features for a Northern Hemisphere fall-winter booster, we think will be that it improves the durability of protective neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and its subvariants beyond 6 months, i.e., the full Northern Hemisphere fall and winter infection season. We'd like to retain high and durable protection against Deltas and ancestral strains, and we'd like to broaden cross-protective immunity to increase the potential for protection against new emerging variants or subvariants that might happen over the coming months.\nSo on Slide 16, I'd like to summarize our work in developing that improved booster. Our primary focus, as you know, has been on developing a bivalent vaccine, and we have taken 3 bivalents into clinical trials. The first mRNA-1273.211 includes 9 of the common mutations and was based on a combination of our prototype wild-type vaccine and Beta. The mRNA-1273.213 bivalent included 11 mutations based on what had emerged from Beta and Delta. And our mRNA-1273.214 booster includes 32 mutations, also now based on the wild-type prototype vaccine and the combination with the Omicron original variant of concern.\nOur latest bivalent, mRNA-1273.214 that includes those 32 mutations that have emerged remains our lead candidate for the fall Northern Hemisphere campaign. The objective of that booster will be to demonstrate superior immunogenicity against variants of concern when it compares to our approved current prototype booster or mRNA-1273 at 50 micrograms. And of course, we want to maintain noninferiority against ancestral strains in case they reemerge.\nNow on Slide 17, I'll summarize the ongoing clinical development work across that portfolio of bivalent boosters. I'll remind you that mRNA-1273 has been authorized or approved in many markets as a third and even a fourth booster. The data for the first bivalent, mRNA 211 has already demonstrated superiority against all variants of concerns tested, including Omicron and Delta, and I'll cover that data in just a moment. But our lead candidate remains, as I said a moment ago, our mRNA-1273.214, which is being evaluated in 2 separate studies, a Phase II/III in the United States and a Phase III P305 study in United Kingdom. Again, both of those are being conducted at a booster dose of 50 micrograms.\nNow on Slide 18, just quickly to update you on the data we have from the 211 first bivalent. Not surprisingly, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the bivalent boosters is consistent with what we saw with mRNA-1273. As you'll see on the chart, both solicited adversary local reactions and systemic reactions are broadly consistent in both frequency and severity. And the frequency and types of unsolicited adverse events were also comparable between the groups with no serious adverse events in the bivalent vaccine group up to 28 days after the booster dose.\nMoving to Slide 19. We have some of the neutralizing antibody data from that study, evaluating again, our mRNA-1273.211 bivalent and comparing that with an approved or authorized mRNA-1273 booster. Looking at neutralizing titers and GMTs, both immediately pre-booster at 1 month or day 29 at 6 months on day 181, across the 3 variants of concern which we tested, higher neutralizing titers were seen for day 29 and day 181 across all the variants of concern with the bivalent booster.\nOn Slide 20, we represent that as a ratio and comparing the performance of the bivalent booster to mRNA-1273 at 1 month and 6 months, and superiority was met for the ancestral and all variants of concern at different time points, as you'll note here. The clinical endpoint for superiority was defined as a geometric mean titer ratio, or GMR, where the lower bound excluded -- the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval excluding one.\nAnd as you'll note, at day 29, a GMR for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus was 1.28; Beta was 1.3; Delta was 1.75; and importantly, Omicron was as high as 2.2. And the 95% confidence interval for Omicron, the lower bound was 1.74, again, demonstrating strong trend towards superiority in this data. Excitingly, at day 181 or 6 months, that superiority was also met for the ancestral virus, Beta and the Omicron variant, which is important because the primary goal we have here is to improve the durability of protection by increasing those titers.\nSo on Slide 21, in conclusion, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the 50-microgram bivalent 211 booster was comparable to the 50-microgram of the authorizer-approved 1273 booster. And we believe that the superiority already demonstrated by the bivalent platform in 211 bodes well for our overall strategy. We continue to believe that bivalent boosters will ensure the broadest immunity across the evolutionary certainty of SARS-CoV-2 and maintain current protection while expanding the breadth and durability of neutralizing antibodies, including, as I just demonstrated a moment ago with 211, out to 6 months. We anticipate the 1 month or day 29 data from our Omicron containing bivalent mRNA-1273.214 in June of 2022.\nNow turning to the rest of our respiratory vaccine pipeline on Slide 23. We announced positive Phase II data from our flu vaccine, mRNA-1010 at our Vaccines Day event. mRNA-1010 is our -- is part of our speed-to-market approach. We plan to start a Phase III immunogenicity study in the second quarter of this year and a Phase III efficacy trial later this year with mRNA-1010. As part of our flu vaccine strategy, we are also advancing in parallel, vaccine candidates that contain both HA antigens and NA antigens. We started a Phase I/II trial of mRNA-1020 and mRNA-1030 last month.\nOur RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345, a Phase III trial in older adults is ongoing, and we are enrolling participants worldwide. We also have an ongoing pediatric RSV trial enrolling as well. In combinations, we plan to start a Phase I trial for both our COVID plus flu and our COVID flu RSV vaccines this year. Our Phase I trial for the hMPV/PIV3 combination vaccine is also now fully enrolled. And our RSV and HMPV combo and our endemic human coronavirus vaccine combo are in preclinical.\nBefore moving from respiratory vaccines, I wanted to take a step back and reflect on the incredible progress over the past 2 years. We have or will have progressed 3 candidates into pivotal Phase III studies within 1 year of an IND being opened. This speed is made possible by our mRNA platform. And we believe our COVID vaccine success has derisked our vaccine pipeline, and we can now move quickly into our RSV and flu pivotal studies. Importantly, in RSV and flu, we are looking at seasonal endpoints or immunogenicity endpoints, which we believe can be -- can allow us to progress faster through Phase III towards its readouts and ultimately to commercialization.\nNow turning to the rest of our pipeline. We have an ongoing Phase III study for our CMV vaccine, mRNA-1647, which is enrolling well and is now enrolling participants globally. Our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis is in Phase I, and our EBV vaccine to prevent long-term sequela such as multiple sclerosis is in preclinical studies. Our HIV vaccines are in Phase I clinical trials with our partners. And the recently announced HSV and VZV vaccines are in preclinical studies.\nWithin public health vaccines, our Zika vaccine continues to enroll in Phase II. And we are pleased to update that our Nipah virus vaccine, IND, was opened, and we look forward to starting that trial soon with our partner.\nNow moving to our therapeutic pipeline on Slide 26. Within oncology, our personalized cancer vaccine is ongoing in a Phase I study and a Phase II study. And we expect the first look at the data from our Phase II study, which is evaluating personalized cancer vaccine plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone, in the fourth quarter of this year. We have 4 other candidates in Phase I or preclinical stages across oncology.\nIn cardiovascular and autoimmune, we have 2 candidates in each area in clinical trials or in the preclinical stage. And within rare diseases, our propionic acidemia program, or PA program for short, which I will give more detail on the next slide, is ongoing in a Phase I/II study. Our MMA program is also ongoing in the Phase I/II study. And our GSD1a program has an open IND and we look forward to enrolling the first participants in that study. We have 3 other candidates in preclinical and rare disease as well.\nNow before I hand it off to David, on Slide 27, I wanted to provide a bit more color on our Phase I/II study in propionic acidemia. As a reminder, PA is a rare metabolic disorder that is characterized by a deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme that's involved in the breakdown of several of the building blocks of proteins called amino acids. As a result, a deficiency in that enzyme, harmful intermediate compounds can build up to toxic levels in the body. This can lead to serious health problems, including recurrent episodes of life-threatening metabolic decompensation events.\nOur therapy for PA encodes for 2 of those proteins that form the deficient enzyme, PCCA and PCCB, and has 1 mRNA for each in the drug. The Phase I/II study is an adaptive trial design, enrolling participants greater than 1 years of age in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Participants received 1 dose of mRNA-3927 every 2 or every 3 weeks for up to 10 doses in that study.\nThe first cohort is fully enrolled, and we are now enrolling patients in the additional cohorts. Five patients have now completed the initial 10-dose course of the study and became eligible for continuing dosing in the open-label extension. And all 5 of those patients have elected to participate in the OLE. A total of 75 doses have now been administered across Phase I/II and the OLE study.\nNow the study is focused on evaluating safety and PK/PD. It is also looking at clinical events, those that are most important, including the metabolic decompensation events I mentioned previously. And of course, we are also evaluating potential biomarkers in the study. We look forward to enrolling more patients and sharing the data this year.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn this over to our financial review from David.\n\nDavid W. Meline\n\nCFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Stephen. We're providing today the analysis of actual 2022 first quarter results, along with a view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Overall, we had a good start to 2022, and I'm very pleased with our operational and commercial performance.\nTurning now to Slide 29, starting with an overview of our sales performance. Total product sales in the first quarter of 2022 were $5.9 billion. This compares to product sales of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. The total sales growth is driven by the fact that we were in an earlier stage of our manufacturing ramp-up in Q1 of last year, with our U.S.-based manufacturing lines roughly 3 months ahead of our international manufacturing capabilities. This also explains the different geographic sales mix. In the first quarter of 2022, sales outside the U.S. were $5 billion, and sales to the U.S. government were $0.9 billion. The majority of sales in Q1 of last year were to the U.S. government.\nTurning to Slide 30 to go into more detail of our Q1 results. Total revenue was $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $1.9 billion in Q1 of last year. The increase of total revenue was driven by the sale of our COVID-19 vaccine. Cost of sales was $1 billion or 17% of the company's product sales in the first quarter. Cost of sales in percent of sales in Q1 of last year was 11% on a reported basis and 22% on adjusted for prelaunch inventory costs, which were expensed in 2020.\nCompared to the prior year adjusted 22%, we are benefiting this quarter from an increased average selling price driven by customer mix, favorable impacts from the scale-up of our manufacturing processes, partially offset by higher write-downs for excess and obsolescence inventory and a current period expense related to future purchase commitments.\nResearch and development expenses were $554 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $401 million in the same period in 2021. The increasing R&D spend continues to be driven by clinical trial expenses for our expanding and maturing development portfolio.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $268 million for Q1 2022 compared to $77 million for the same period in 2021. The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally, with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out. Our Q1 2022 results also include the initial upfront endowment of $50 million for the newly established Moderna Foundation.\nProvision for income taxes was $572 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $39 million in the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14%. Let me remind you of the fact that we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020, which resulted in a nonrecurring benefit to the reported tax rate last year.\nWe recorded after-tax net income of $3.7 billion in Q1 compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share in Q1 2022 were $8.58. As a final point on the quarter and beyond, we currently do not have any commercial activities or R&D activities in the Ukraine or Russia.\nTurning to cash and cash deposits on Slide 31. We ended Q1 2022 with cash and investments of $19.3 billion compared to $17.6 billion at the end of 2021. The increase is driven by our commercial activities. The balance of cash deposits for future product supply was $5.3 billion compared to $6 billion at the end of 2021. The reduction quarter-over-quarter is driven by product deliveries against customer deposits.\nNow turning to Slide 32. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. For R&D, we continue to forecast to spend in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion in order to advance and accelerate our pipeline, both for existing and new programs.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technology and capabilities. We are considering attractive opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments. We're in multiple active discussions regarding additional external collaboration opportunities.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. We completed our initial $1 billion share buyback program in January and announced a new share buyback program of $3 billion in February. Across these 2 authorizations, we repurchased a total of 3.8 million shares for $0.6 billion during the first quarter.\nThe next slide shows a progression of our share count since we initiated our share repurchase program. As a reminder, we received board approval for our initial $1 billion share repurchase program in August 2021 and began repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our quarter-end basic shares outstanding declined from 405 million at the end of September 2021 to 400 million at the end of March 2022.\nWe repurchased 7 million shares, more than offsetting 2 million shares of common stock issued in connection with equity compensation over this period. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding also declined from 434 million in the third quarter of 2021 to 426 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of the share repurchase activity.\nNow let's turn to 2022 financial framework on Page 34. We have signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2022 in the amount of approximately $21 billion. There's a potential downside to this number from timing of COVAX deliveries if COVAX is unable to confirm demand aligned to their contracted volume in the 2022 calendar year. There is also an upside to this number from potential additional contracts for the fall booster dose, including for the U.S. market.\nIn 2022, we believe that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will evolve into an endemic phase with a more seasonal sales pattern. As a result, we continue to expect the timing of sales to be larger in the second half of 2022 than in the first half.\nOur total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. We continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to increase compared to prior year, driven by both a decrease in our average selling price and a forecasted increase in manufacturing cost. The year-on-year decrease in average selling price is due to the higher share of COVAX APAs for delivery this year compared to last year.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves into an endemic phase, we forecast our manufacturing unit costs to increase. This is driven by a move to smaller dose presentations and the cost for adjusting our production and supply chain infrastructure, including future purchase commitments. We continue to expect our full year 2022 reported cost of sales in the low to mid-20% range, which incorporates all the expected adjustments that we've identified for the 2022 calendar year. The cost of sales for Spikevax beyond 2022 will be further impacted by geographic customer mix, the pricing effects of the private market as it develops as well as our initiatives to optimize and improve efficiency.\nFor R&D and SG&A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $4 billion, driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scale up of the company. Based on current tax laws, we continue to expect our 2022 tax rate to be in the mid-teens as a result of the benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income, driven by our international business mix and stock-based compensation deduction. Finally, regarding capital expenditures, we continue to plan for capital expenditures in the range of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion as we further build out our manufacturing and general company infrastructure globally.\nAs this is the last earnings call for me as CFO of Moderna, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome Jorge Gomez, who's well qualified to lead Moderna in the next stage of its development. I would also like to recognize my own team and my colleagues for our success in ramping up a global commercial company and contributing to taming the pandemic. I have great confidence in the company's ability to fully realize the vast potential of its mRNA technology platform against the many remaining unmet medical needs.\nThis concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I would like to turn the call back over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, for that review of the quarter and those kind of words. More importantly, I would like to thank you for agreeing to come out of retirement in the spring of 2020 to help us scale Moderna at an unprecedented speed from an early-stage development U.S.-centric company to a commercial, global company. I am very grateful for you agreeing to come out of retirement to help us. Your work to get us to this point was crucial. You built a strong team and robust business processes. Thank you for also agreeing to stay on as a consultant as we transition to your successor. And so I want to wish you and your wife well in the next phase of your life.\nAs many of you know, we announced that Jorge Gomez will join us as Chief Financial Officer, effective next Monday, May 9. Jorge brings with him experience in the capacity of CFO for global health care organizations, which are Dentsply and Cardinal health. Jorge has the same kind of high-quality finance trading as David as a General Motor finance alumni. He has a broad set of international experiences in addition to having been CFO of publicly-traded companies.\nI would also like to welcome Arpa Garay, who is joining us from Merck at the end of this month as our Chief Commercial Officer. She was a member of Merck Executive Committee where she most recently served as Head of Marketing. Arpa also has a very impressive background and multiple experiences in both sales and marketing. I look forward to partnering with these 2 leaders to continue to scale rapidly Moderna.\nBefore moving to Q&A, I would like to review with you our 2022 priorities. Priority number one, to execute on the $21 billion of signed APAs and to prepare for a successful fall 2022 booster season.\nPriority number two, to execute on our 4 Phase III vaccine programs, an Omicron COVID-19 bivalent booster, flu booster, RSV booster and CMV prime series vaccine, which could lead to 3 respiratory commercial launches over the next 2 to 3 years.\nPriority number three, to expand beyond infectious disease vaccine into therapeutics and share proof-of-concept with for PA, MMA and PCV programs.\nPriority number four, to bring forward more M&A candidates into clinical development.\nAnd last but not least, priority number five, to continue to expand our mRNA platform, so the possibility of mRNA impact to patients continues to increase over time.\nI also wanted to remind people of our upcoming events this year, (inaudible) in just 2 weeks on May 17. We'll also host our typical annual R&D Day in September and first ESG Day in November.\nWhile we have had a profound impact on humanity over the last 2 years, we believe that what is ahead of us to help protect and treat hundreds of millions of people is even more exciting. We'll continue to execute on our mission, and we thank you for your support. This is just the beginning.\nOperator, we'll be happy to take questions now.",

I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading.\nWe are pleased to report today $18.5 billion of revenues for fiscal year 2021 and a GAAP net income of $12.2 billion, translating into a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $28.29 billion, with a cash balance at the end of the year of $17.6 billion. We announced this morning that we have completed our August 2021 $1 billion share buyback plan, which reduced our average share count during the fourth quarter for the first time in the company history.\nI am very proud of our team's ability to advance as well as expand with new programs our development pipeline. In respiratory vaccines, for COVID, as you know, we received full BLA approval from the U.S. FDA for Spivak. With authorization for 12 to 17 years old in key markets globally, we are running a 50-microgram dose study in the U.S. for adolescent following discussions with the FDA. We are pleased to report that we have also started to receive authorization for children aged 6 to 11 years of age, beginning in Australia last week, with more countries expected in the days and weeks to come. Also, those are first participants in our Omicron specific vaccine trial, mRNA-1273.529. And today, we're announcing that we plan to bring mRNA-1273.214 bivalence vaccine, combining the wild-type vaccine mRNA-1273 and the Omicron vaccine mRNA-1273.529 into one single dose booster into the clinic with a total mass of 50 microgram.\nWe are very excited that now RSV is in Phase III. This is our third vaccine starting the Phase III. And for flu, we are waiting the Phase II data for mRNA-1010. As soon as we have them, we will pick a dose and will initiate our Phase III for flu. And we will start our Phase I for COVID test program, mRNA-273. For latent viruses, CMV is enrolling in Phase III, EBV and HIV are now in Phase I, and we're very excited to announce last week that we're adding 2 new latent virus programs to our development pipeline, one vaccine against HSV and one vaccine against. More latent viruses vaccine are in the works in our labs.\nIn Therapeutics, PA and MMA are in the clinic dosing and recruiting more patients. We announced a new checkpoint cancer vaccine, mRNA-4359, and [not] has informed us that they are returning the rights to the vaccine, while evaluating future steps for this program. The company continues to expand at a rapid pace. We now have one approved medicine, 2 in Phase III RSV and CMV, and 5 in Phase II, for a total of 44 programs. We are deploying capital to accelerate and expand the pipeline. The company now has 3 patent team members across the world, with a great culture, and 11 commercial subsidiaries across Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Of $17 billion account balance at the end of the year is enabling us to scale across research, development, manufacturing, commercial and G&A.\nWith this, let me now turn to Paul.\n\nPaul Burton\n\nChief Medical Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephane, and hello, everyone.\nIt is almost exactly 3 months ago that we first heard about the (inaudible) on -- And today, we look back on 3 months that have seen millions of new cases of COVID-19 infection worldwide due to Omicron and a death toll that turned out to be almost 20% higher than that seen during the Delta wave. It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus capable of making very large evolutionary leaps in its structure and function. And while we are hopeful that we are about to enter a period of relative stability in the northern hemisphere, we believe firmly that a vaccine booster dose that will be required for the full of 2022 to provide ongoing protection against this virus.\nWe have seen measures taken by the United Kingdom recently to offer an additional booster dose to those at higher risk. And we believe such measures will become more widespread with governments looking to protect their populations from disease later this year and support their health care systems. As always, a huge note of appreciation to the frontline workers, the health care workers who have continued to immunize us and protect us during this pandemic. Their tireless work has saved millions of lives worldwide.\nI'm going to review some data today that underpins why we believe an additional booster shot will be required certainly by the fall of 2022.\nFirst, let me share with you some data from a study of almost 440,000 individuals in the United States Veterans Administration database, looking at the effectiveness of mRNA-1273 spike used in the primary series vaccination setting. As we know, the mRNA vaccines are extremely safe and effective. And the data here show the exceptional effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in this well-powered and prospectively designed comparative effectiveness study, mRNA-1273 significantly reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization compared to BNT162b2. These data are reassuring and continue to underpin the strong global confidence that governments, health care systems and individuals have in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA-1273.\nIndeed, an example of that is the very recent announcement by the CDC at British Columbia for the preferential use of the Moderna vaccine in anyone over 12 years of age living with immunocompromised.\nA similar pattern of results are seen from real-world effectiveness studies in the United Kingdom. The graphs I'm going to show you here come from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, looking at the effect of either the Pfizer BionTech or Moderna vaccines and their vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization.\nFirst, let me show you the results in people who for their primary vaccination received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and were then boosted with either the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine. We see retained protection against the Delta variant of concern in the field squares, but we see waning of effect in the field circles against Omicron.\nThe same is true though more pronounced on the next part of this graph. And here, you see individuals who received as their primary vaccine the AstraZeneca vaccine. Again, in this very large real-world assessment, we can see that mRNA-1273 provides protection against hospitalization due to both Delta, but to a lesser extent, Omicron infection. Of note, we do see waning of protection over time against hospitalization due to Omicron infection. And this fits with the profound immune invasion we know to be the case with Omicron. But it is also a driver of our. Not only will a booster vaccination be required later in 2022, but also a booster will be required that protects against both the Delta and Omicron variants of concern, as Stephane announced earlier.\nThis is because Delta, as we know, is associated with strong pathogenicity, and Omicron, as we have seen, due to its transmissibility and infectivity, is also associated with substantial morbidity and strain on health care systems through share bulker cases, hence, protection against both Delta and Omicron may well be necessary in the next booster vaccination.\nOn Slide 10, we see data directly explaining the clinical phenomenon I just showed you. These data come from one of our previously conducted clinical studies. Serra from individuals immunized and boosted with mRNA-1273 is able to substantially neutralize the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus, D614G, shown here in black, but to a lesser extent, Omicron, shown in red, and this is particularly true by 6 months following booster administration. Again, it is these data, coupled with the real-world effectiveness data that I just showed you, that leads us to believe an additional booster dose will be needed later in 2022, providing protection against both Delta and Omicron variants of concern.\nYou can see this point made clearly again in Slide 11, where we estimate the duration of protection against either the ancestral D614G strain or against Omicron. With lower starting titers, protection against Omicron wanes and forward to levels that would begin to allow breakthrough infection to occur due to Omicron and around 9 months after boosting.\nAs leaders in mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 disease, we will continue to monitor this carefully along with other emerging variants and continue to do whatever we can to provide people with a safe and highly effective vaccine booster for 2022 and years to come. We announced in January that we were able to go from identification of Omicron to testing of a new vaccine in humans in just 2 months. That is a remarkable testament to the Moderna mRNA platform and its utility.\nSlide 12 will be familiar to many of you as we first presented this slide at our Vaccines Day in April 2021. The graph is an illustration of the different phases of the pandemic to endemic continuum and its effect as measured by morbidity or disease burden over time. The shape of the graph was adopted from what we knew about previous pandemics at the time and what we expected from the current pandemic, taking into consideration the increased levels of immunity that our immune systems collectively became familiarized with the SARS CoV-2 virus, either through infection or vaccination.\nAs the graph shows, and with hindsight, it is easy to recognize that the very first wave of the pandemic when all of the world's population was naive to this virus caused the highest levels of morbidity and mortality. With each subsequent wave in mid-2021 with Delta and in late 2021 and early 2022 with Omicron, the morbidity observed from these waves tended to be less severe, certainly relative to the first wave, as their immune systems became more experienced at fighting the SARS CoV-2 virus. Beyond 2022, there still remains uncertainty. However, given what we know now of other pandemics like the 1918 influenza pandemic and more importantly, what we have observed with the SARS COV-2 pandemic, we do believe that we are transitioning into an endemic phase, marked by a period of stability in case counts, hospitalizations and death, at least in the northern hemisphere. We will continue to carefully monitor the situation in the southern hemisphere as winter approaches there on a background of continuing Delta and Omicron infection pressure. And we will work as quickly as possible to generate new specific booster vaccine data.\nIn the endemic phase, the virus will continue to circulate but at rates that are static and more predictable. We continue to expect morbidity from the virus when it is endemic. And we believe, like other respiratory viruses, we will see a seasonal pattern of disease that emerge. But the good news is, because our immune system is now much more familiar with the virus, either through vaccination, infection or both, we do not expect that the majority of the population will be as susceptible to severe disease in the endemic phase as they were in the pandemic phase. Instead, as with other respiratory viruses, we believe protection from SARS COV-2 will be critical for populations that are likely to be most susceptible to severe disease and high burden of disease. Providing the broadest protection possible will be a focus for us in the endemic phase, and we believe, as Stephane mentioned, multivalent vaccines against SARS COV-2 and its variants will help achieve this.\nAs I alluded to earlier, respiratory viruses cause significant disease annually, and endemic coronaviruses are no exception to this. Slide 13 shows the incidence of community-acquired infections leading to hospitalizations in New York City during the 2018 to 2019 season prior to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic.\nOn the chart, you can see that other endemic human coronaviruses, in fact, cause the highest level of hospitalizations in individuals between 65 and 79 years of age and those 80 years and above, followed by RSV and influenza. Across OECD countries, the estimated impact from endemic human coronaviruses leads to over 1 million outpatient visits, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths in the over 65-year-old population annually. We believe SARS CoV-2 will follow a similar pattern of seasonal disease as other respiratory viruses do and will impact vulnerable populations. Protecting populations against SARS CoV-2 will be critical in the months and years to come. And protecting against combinations of respiratory viruses such as SARS CoV-2, flu and RSV with a single yearly shot will be central to our strategy. Stephen Hoge will shortly provide an update on our robust ongoing strategy to achieve that.\nSo in summary, the available real-world data continue to show the remarkable effectiveness of mRNA-1273. Real world data shows that a 50-microgram booster dose of mRNA-1273 provides protection against hospitalization caused by Omicron, but we note waning of antibody titers by 6 months post boosting. We believe that our full 2022 booster will be needed globally. And as leaders in mRNA vaccines, we believe it is important to develop booster vaccines that will give us an opportunity to protect against Omicron and future variants as we continue our fight to help end this pandemic.\nI will now hand over to Dr. Stephen Hoge to provide further updates on this topic and the Moderna pipeline. Stephen?\n\nStephen Hoge\n\nPresident, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.\nOn Slide 16, I'd like to briefly summarize our COVID-19 booster development strategy for the endemic phase. So as Paul covered, the strategic rationale for a seasonal booster has 3 parts. First, we think neutralizing titers will wane similar to the endemic human coronaviruses, as Paul just described. That decline in neutralizing titers will increase the risk of breakthrough hospitalization in those at higher risk, specifically including older adults and the immune compromised. We think the emergence of new variants of concern will also have the risk of accelerating waning and broadening the risk of breakthroughs to other populations.\nSo the desired features for our Northern Hemisphere fall and winter 2022 booster are described here. First, we'd like to improve the durability of protection for neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and Omicron mutations to at least 6 months that will provide full protection through the Northern Hemisphere fall winter infection season. We'd like to retain the high and durable protection we've been seeing with a prototype vaccine against Delta and the ancestral strains. And third, we'd like to broaden cross-protective immunity to the extent possible to increase the potential for protection against a new emergent variant of concern, which could emerge perhaps from the Southern Hemisphere this midyear.\nSo on Slide 17, I'll quickly summarize our strategy for developing an updated booster for fall 2022. We are currently evaluating 3 different booster strategies in adults age 18 plus. The first, as both Paul and Stephane have mentioned, is a bivalent booster vaccine made up of the prototype mRNA-1273 and an Omicron specific mRNA-1273.529. This bivalent has been called 214. We are also evaluating, as we previously announced, an Omicron-specific booster, mRNA-1273.529. And of course, we will continue to evaluate our prototype booster, mRNA-1273, for which there is a large body of real-world evidence, as Paul just described. We're evaluating these 3 different approaches across 2 studies in the United States and the United Kingdom, the Phase II study in the United States of approximately 750 participants and a 3,000 participant study in the United Kingdom. Both are looking at both bivalent and Omicron-specific boosters. And both will be looking at both third and fourth dose of those boosters. In the U.K. study, we will also be looking at heterologous boosting, including on the background of other mRNA vaccines and non-mRNA vaccines.\nNow I'd like to take a moment on Slide 18 to provide some scientific insight to why we believe the bivalent vaccine booster for the fall of 2022 offers a potential advantage. Slide 18 includes data on some of our prior bivalent boosters. And this data -- this emerging data suggest to us that there may be an opportunity to improve durability against variants of concern while preserving activity against the ancestral variants. This data is based on one of our prior bivalence, mRNA1273.211, or 211 for short. and 211, as you may recall, was based on the 1273 vaccine and the Beta variant of concern, which emerged approximately a year ago.\nWhen we compare over time how the 2 different booster strategies, our prototype booster on the left-hand column here, and our bivalent booster on the right-hand column here, do against the 2 different virus variants that were in the vaccine, you see an emergence of potential improvement in durability.\nSo first, to orient you to the slide. mRNA-1273 was given that 50 micrograms as a booster to those who had previously received 2 doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. And on the top left panel, you'll see how the neutralizing titers or pseudovirus neutralizing titers against the ancestral strain of the virus, the D614G virus, in our validated clinical assays. Underneath there, you'll see how those -- the pseudovirus neutralization titers against the Beta variant of concern in blue. And in the middle column, you'll contrast that with a bivalent 211 booster, which, in this case, included the Beta variant of concern, again, at the same dose level, 50 micrograms. Top right panel is the ancestral variant of concern, ancestral virus, D614G, and and lower right is the Beta variant of concern or the B1.351.\nNow as you'll note, comparing the performance against the ancestral D614G virus, both mRNA-1273 and the bivalent Beta containing booster do a good job boosting neutralizing titers by day 29 after the booster. So one month post booster, neutralizing titers are approximately 1,800 for 1273 and 2,200 for the bivalent. And importantly, as we test the serum 6 months after booster, noted as day 181 here, you'll see that neutralizing titers remain high, approximately 1,000 in both boosters.\nNow the situation against the variant of concern, in this case, Beta, is slightly different. Again, both boosters, increased neutralizing titers by day 29 one month after booster to quite reasonable levels, approximately 1,000 in both cases. However, when you follow out 6 months, there is a difference in the neutralizing titers that emerges. And not surprisingly, the bivalent booster, which includes the Beta variant of concern, starts to see more durable neutralizing titers, 402, as noted here, as opposed to 154 for mRNA-1273. So in summary, 6 months after a 211 bivalent booster, the neutralizing titers against the Beta variant of concern appear to be more durable than with just a prototype booster. And the durability or the rate of decline for the Beta neutralizing titers more closely matches that seen for the ancestral virus following the bivalent 211 booster. Including the Beta variant of concern, therefore, appears to be improving the durability of neutralizing titers against that variant of concern.\nNow on the next slide, Slide 19, we have that same data, but now plotted as a function of time to help you visualize it a little more clearly.\nOn the left-hand side, we're contrasting the mRNA-1273 booster as a black line against a bivalent Beta containing booster in the red line. On the left-hand side, you're again looking at the ancestral D614G neutralizing titers. And as you can see, following a booster approximately 6 months after booster dose 2, neutralizing titers for both of the boosters, both bivalent and the prototype vaccine, increased significantly. And the data we have out to 6 months, if you project that forward as we do with the dotted lines, suggest that we will maintain quite high neutralizing titers, perhaps as long as one year.\nNow the situation on the right-hand side highlights we think the potential for improving durability with a bivalent vaccine. Again, here, the black line is mRNA-1273 and the red line is the bivalent Beta containing booster at the same dose level. Now while both boosters increase neutralizing titers to approximately 1,000 within one month of boosting, what starts to emerge 6 months later is a different degree of durability in those neutralizing titers, with the bivalent vaccine containing the Beta antigen doing slightly better, as you can see with the red line. And if you project that forward, it suggests that the bivalent vaccine neutralizing titers against the Beta variant of concern will remain quite high, perhaps as long as a year, whereas with a prototype vaccine, those neutralizing titers appear to be decaying more quickly, back towards baseline levels or pre-booster levels by approximately 8 to 9 months.\nOn Slide 20, just to quickly summarize therefore where we are in COVID-19 booster development for fall 2022. We believe that a seasonal booster will be necessary to prevent breakthrough diseases, including hospitalization and vulnerable populations. And we believe that the continued evolution of the virus is going to continue to put pressure on pre-existing immunity, whether that's naturally derived or vaccine provided. We think the fall 2022 booster should reflect the diversity of circulating mutations that are out there in order -- and seek to achieve greater than 6 months of neutralizing titer durability to increase the potential for protection throughout the entire fall season, in this case, we think September through February. So Moderna is developing an Omicron-containing bivalent booster based on data that we have from prior bivalent candidates that suggests that incorporating the variant of concern of those mutations from that vein concern has the potential to improve the durability against such variant of concern.\nNow moving to Slide 21, just quickly catching up on other developments in our COVID-19 vaccine. We have made progress in primary series and booster in adolescent and pediatric populations.\nSo in adolescents first, we've received regulatory approvals for spike backs in Europe, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and many other countries. In U.S., we plan to submit an EUA for 100 micrograms of mRNA-1273 in adolescents that are immune compromised or an elevated risk of severe outcomes. And we're also evaluating the potential of a lower dose, 50 micrograms, as a primary series. And lastly, as has been noted previously, we're preparing to submit data for 50 micrograms as a booster dose in adolescents and 50 micrograms as the booster dose in adults as well. And that will include data on heterologous boosting. In pediatrics, or the 6- to 11-year old, we received provisional approval for SpikebaX in Australia and submitted to multiple other international regulatory agencies and expect authorization shortly. The U.S. submission is pending alignment with the United States FDA on the adolescent application. And we will also continue to evaluate lower doses, including a 25-microgram primary series dose. Finally, in the youngest, 6 months to 5-years old pediatric population, we expect data on our 25-microgram 2-dose primary series in the first quarter. And pending that data, we'll plan to submit to regulators. We are also continuing to evaluate lower doses and the potential of a third dose in that population.\nPivoting to the broader respiratory vaccine portfolio on Slide 22. Beyond COVID-19, we continue to make progress across all of our respiratory vaccines. As Stephane mentioned, our flu vaccine is fully enrolled with Phase II. And pending that data, we will prepare to move forward, which we still anticipate doing in 2022 into a Phase III study. We're also preparing to start a combination flu and COVID vaccine, which is currently in preclinical, but we expect to start the Phase I study this year. Our older adult RSV program has started its Phase III study portion, and that pivotal study is ongoing enrolling. We have a pediatric RSV study, which we will move forward in Phase I.\nWe have also 2 different respiratory combination vaccines. First, the human metanumovirusin parvovirus 3 vaccine, which is in Phase Ib and has now fully enrolled, and an RSV plus HMPV vaccine, which remains in preclinical development, and we helped this shortly.\nMoving now to latent and public health vaccines on Slide 23. As discussed, CMV continues to enroll in the Phase III CM VICTORY study. We have also moved forward 2 new latent virus vaccines in the clinical testing, our EBV vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis in Phase I, and our HIV, our first HIV vaccine, mRNA-1644, is also in Phase I. We announced 2 new development candidates, which I'll cover briefly in the next couple of slides, against HSV and VZV. And our public health vaccines against Zika and Nipa continue to progress.\nBriefly on Slide 24, I'd like to introduce our -- the first of our 2 new development candidates in this space. mRNA-1608 is our vaccine against herpes simplex virus 2. HSV 2 primarily infects the genitals and establishes lifelong latent infections within the sensory neurons. There is a significant burden of disease in developed markets, including approximately 18 million people who are HSV-positive, HSV 2 positive positive in the United States. Globally, that represents about 5% of the population. Primary burden of disease is a reduction in quality of life from recurrent lesions. Our mRNA-1608 vaccine encodes antigens on the surface of the HSV virus and has been able to induce very strong immune responses, as illustrated in the figure to the right. Neutralizing titers in mice following an HSV-2 vaccine with mRNA-1608 are significantly above the levels seen in human sero from those who are seropositive. This gives us reason to believe that we will be able to provide a significant benefit with this vaccine in this population.\nThe second development candidate is on the following slide, Slide 25. This is our mRNA-1468 program against herpes zoster or shingles. Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of latent neurocells esostervirus, or BCV for short. It's principally a disease that's seen as a result of declining immunity in older adults, where protection against BCV decline, leading to reactivation of the virus and painful and very itchy lesions. Herpes zoster occurs in about 1 out of 3 adults in their lifetime. And the incidence is increasing as populations age, and particularly increases over the age of 50.\nOn the right-hand side is previously published data in the Journal of Vaccine on our VZV vaccine, in this case, mRNA-1468. Our vaccine in nonhuman primates was compared against the protein and protein plus adjuvant, as they stand in a proxy for the shingles vaccine, which is already approved for this indication. As you note on the right, in nonhuman primates, the mRNA vaccine against GE resulted in significant and elevated neutralizing titers after 2 doses, and we believe will provide the basis for a strong potential clinical benefit with mRNA-1468.\nMoving now to our therapeutic pipeline. We continue to make progress across a range of different programs. On Slide 26, I'll note a few very quickly. First, our PCV program in Phase I is ongoing and the Phase II is fully enrolled. We expect data in the fourth quarter of 2022. We are also going to provide a bit of an update on the checkpoint vaccine and newly announced development candidate in just a minute. Highlighting in other therapeutic areas, our VEGF program continues to move forward in Phase II with AstraZeneca. And in rare diseases, our PA and MMA programs continue to enroll in their Phase I, with a Phase I -- first dose level cohort fully enrolled in PA and continued enrolling of additional cohorts. We also continue to make progress across all of our other preclinical programs in rare diseases, including GSD1a, PKU, CN1 and the cystic fibrosis program with Vertex.\nOn Slide 27, I'd like to briefly cover our latest development candidate, a checkpoint vaccine to promote anti-checkpoint T cell responses in cancer, otherwise known as mRNA-4359. So briefly, the objective of this program is to stimulate effector T cells that target and kill suppressive immune in cancer cells that express high levels of targeted checkpoint antigen. And previously identified that there are pre-existing IDO and PD-L1 specific T cells that have been identified in cancer patients and tumors. IDO and PD-L1 specific T cells can kill and remove the immunosuppressive regulatory immune cells and cancer cells that overexpress these antigens. It's an important counterbalance that helps liberate the immune response against the tumor. Our vaccine can expand IDO and PD-L1 specific T cells in preclinical models. And the vaccine induced direct tumor cell killing can facilitate recognition of tumor-associated antigens by other specific T cells, leading to more broad tumor kill. Systemic blockade with PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies may further amplify this effect. We will initially be developing mRNA-4359 against indications, including first-line cutaneous melanoma Stage IIIb and first-line non-small cell lung cancer.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to David to walk you through the financials.\n\nDavid W. Meline\n\nCFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Stephen.\nWe are providing today the analysis of actual 2021 fourth quarter and full year results along with a view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. 2021 was a transformative year for the company as it marked the transition from an R&D-focused entity to a commercial stage company. I'm very pleased with our performance, and I wanted to thank all of our employees at Moderna for their dedication and response to the many challenges during this unprecedented company scale up.\nTurning now to Slide 29, starting with an overview of our sales performance. Total product sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $6.9 billion, representing 297 million doses delivered to our customers. This compares to sales of $4.8 billion for 208 million doses in Q3 and 199 million doses in Q2.\nWe increased our dose supply in the fourth quarter by 43% compared to Q3 after a relatively stable picture in Q2 and Q3 as we successfully focused on removing bottlenecks in our supply chain network. Sales of our COVID vaccine have shifted in terms of geographic mix over the course of the year, in line with our expectations and the ramp-up of our international manufacturing capabilities.\nSales outside the U.S. to the rest of the world were $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting 252 million doses. And sales to the U.S. government were $0.7 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting 45 million doses sold. For the full year, we sold 807 million doses, resulting in product sales of $17.7 billion. We generated sales of $5.4 billion in the U.S. and $12.3 billion with customers in the rest of the world. Approximately 25% of our delivered doses went to low and middle income countries, either through direct sales or facilitated by no nations from other customers.\nTurning to Slide 30 to go into more detail of our Q4 results. The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech company to a commercial-stage business continues to be apparent when reviewing our financial results. The comparison of the fourth quarter of 2021 to prior year is not very meaningful due to the significant growth, which is why I primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q3 on this slide.\nTotal revenue was $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $5 billion in the third quarter and $0.6 billion in the prior year period. The increase of total revenue was driven by the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine.\nProduct sales in Q4 2021 were $6.9 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 44%. Cost of sales was $952 million or 14% of company's product sales in the fourth quarter compared to $722 million or 15% of product sales in the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter percentage improvement was driven by favorable manufacturing cost as the average selling price remained relatively stable.\nResearch and development expenses were $648 million in the fourth quarter compared to $521 million in the third quarter and $759 million in the same period in 2020. The higher spend versus prior quarter was primarily driven by increased clinical trial expenses from our expanding and maturing development portfolio. The decrease in spending compared to 2020 was mainly due to the fact that the prior year number includes approximately $200 million of prelaunch inventory costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $201 million for Q4 compared to $168 million in the prior quarter and $79 million for the same period in the prior year. The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally, with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out.\nProvision for income taxes was $542 million in the fourth quarter, following $219 million in the third quarter and an insignificant amount in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10%. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by higher earnings. Let me remind you of the fact that we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. In 2021, we released the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, which resulted in a nonrecurring full year benefit to our effective tax rate of about 5 percentage points.\nWe recorded net income of $4.9 billion in Q4 compared to $3.3 billion in Q3, an increase of 46%. This compares to a loss of $0.3 billion in Q4 of last year. Diluted earnings per share for Q4 2021 were $11.29.\nTurning now to full year financial results on Slide 31. Total revenue was $18.5 billion for the full year 2021 compared to $0.8 billion in 2020. The significant growth was driven by the sales of 807 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine, resulting in product sales of $17.7 billion. Cost of sales was $2.6 billion or 15% of the company's product sales in 2021, including third-party royalties of $641 million. A portion of the inventory costs associated with this year's product sales was expensed as prelaunch inventory in 2020. If inventories sold for the full year was valued at cost, our cost of sales for the period would have been $2.8 billion or 16% of product sales.\nResearch and development expenses were $2 billion in 2021 compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was driven by clinical trial expenses for our expanding pipeline and the related organizational build-out. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $0.6 billion for the full year 2021 compared to $0.2 billion in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increases in consulting and outside services, personnel-related costs, marketing expense and distributor fees, primarily attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization-related activities and increased headcount. Provision for income taxes was $1.1 billion for the full year 2021 compared to an insignificant amount in 2020. The effective tax rate in 2021 was 8%. It was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to a nonrecurring benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign derived intangible income deduction as well as benefits related to stock-based compensation. Net income was $12.2 billion for the full year 2021 compared to a net loss of $0.8 billion in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $28.29 for the full year 2021.\nTurning to cash and cash deposits on Slide 32. We ended 2021 with cash and investments of $17.6 billion compared to $15.3 billion at the end of Q3. The increase is driven by our commercial activity. The balance of cash deposits for future product supply was $6 billion at the end of the year compared to $6.7 billion at the end of Q3. The reduction quarter-over-quarter is driven by commercial deliveries against our commitments.\nNow turning to Slide 33. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. For R&D, we have significantly increased our spending in 2021 to approximately $2 billion. And we expect to continue to further increase our spending in this area to advance and accelerate our pipeline, both for existing and new programs. We are also further increasing our investment into our global manufacturing network in digital, automation and AI, as well as scaling up our global commercial operations.\nOur second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technology and capabilities. We are considering attractive opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments. Our announced collaborations with Metagenomi and Karisma Therapeutics fall into this category.\nAfter evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. We announced a $1 billion share buyback program in August of last year, which we completed in January of this year. As part of today's press release, we announced that the Board has authorized a new share buyback program of $3 billion.\nSimilar to last year, we provide you with a financial framework for 2022, which you will find on Page 34. We have signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2022 in the amount of approximately $19 billion and signed option agreements for delivery in 2022 of approximately $3 billion on a probabilitized basis. In 2022, we believe that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will evolve to an endemic phase. And as a result, we expect the timing of sales to be larger in the second half of 2022 than the first half.\nOur total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties, as well as logistics and warehousing costs. For the full year 2022, we expect a cost of sales ratio in the low to mid-20s percent range. The increase compared to prior year is driven by an expected increase in manufacturing costs as well as a decrease in expected average selling price per dose. The forecast increase of manufacturing costs is primarily driven by higher costs for fill/finish activities due to an expected shift from pandemic pack sizes to smaller dose and vial presentations. The decrease in average selling price is driven by the forecast increased deliveries to low-income countries.\nFor R&D and SG&A expenses, we expect full year expenses to be approximately $4 billion, driven by our maturing development portfolio and the global scale up of the company. Based on current tax laws, we expect our 2022 tax rate to be in the mid-teens as a result of the benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, driven by our international business mix and stock-based compensation deductions. Finally, regarding capital expenditures, we are planning for capital expenditures in the range of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion as we further build out our manufacturing and general company infrastructure globally.\nThis concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance. And I now turn the call over to Stephane.\n\nStéphane Bancel\n\nCEO & Director, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, Stephen and Paul. Let me now share some thoughts about where we're heading.\nI am pleased to see how the team is executing on our product strategy. Priority #1, plan respiratory annual booster. RSV is already in Phase III for waiting for flu data to start the Phase III on flu and so the Phase I on a COVID [Phase II] candidate, mRNA-1073. Priority #2, latent viruses vaccines. CMV In Phase III, now with 5 candidates, including VZV against shingles, and more coming. Priority #3 fire, with a new checkpoint cancer vaccine. And Priority #4, expanding our unique mRNA platform to create new medicine.\nAs I shared in January at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, there was a big change in commercial momentum from Moderna between early 2021 and early 2022. In early 2021, vaccine looked the same after Phase III data, and now we see strong real world evidence that SpikeVax has long duration of efficacy. In early 2021, we were supply constrained. And now we're getting to a place reported to scale manufacturing, thanks to investments made last year and are less supply constrained. We have contracts with many governments around the world. But in early 2021, we have a few team members on the ground in most countries.\nOn Slide 37, you can see that PaxVax booster market share has increased across key markets. You see that shift in market share data from around the world where we have teams on the ground. Even in Germany, where there is a national mRNA champion, we have moved our share of the booster market from 4% in October 2021 to almost 40% in January 2022. And it is also clear that OECD countries or high-income countries have become de facto an mRNA market. We have continued to increase our signed APAs to now around $19 billion. We also have approximately $3 billion in privatized options. We continue to have numerous discussions with government and NGOs around the world. For example, the current U.S. contract has its last shipments coming before the summer of 2022. This means that in the $19 billion plus other option, there is currently no APAs for the U.S. for the second half for 2022.\nAs David mentioned, when we shifted to endemic, we expect to seasonality in sales. This year, we expect to see continued primary vaccination and boosting the (inaudible) in the first half, and a shift to boosters as a fourth dose booster in the northern hemisphere in the second half of the year, similar to flu vaccines.\nWe were pleased to announce last week a big expansion of our commercial network. From our current 11 countries where we have Moderna commercial teams on the ground, we announced an additional 10 countries, in Europe, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, and in Asia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong. You have seen the impact of our strong real-world evidence data, coupled with teams on the ground, drive greater Moderna market penetration. I believe the same phenomena will happen in those 10 new markets.\nWe have a direct commercial presence in these 21 important markets. We will maximize the impact of Spivak and also have the teams to launch our respiratory annual booster for latent virus vaccine and the rest of the portfolio. That commercial coverage and capabilities will prove critical in our ability to maximize our impact on patients and the resulting value creation. We now have distributors in Central and Eastern Europe. We have distributors in Asia Pacific, and with this week announcement, in Latin America. We, of course, continue to work with Kovac to provide access to a vaccine to low-income countries.\nStrategically, we want to create a new business model with governments around for prime respiratory annual booster. We have started to create a subscription or service model with governments around the world. We have announced memoranda of understanding with the government of Canada and Australia. We are currently in discussions with several other countries. These are 10-year agreements for the supply of a pan-respiratory annual booster. We have also governments which have signed APAs for 2023, as you can see on the slide. Numerous discussions are ongoing as we speak about securing supply for 2023 for the endemic setting to protect people at risk: 15 years and above, people with comorbidity factors, people who stuck with them at risk and adults who simply do not want to get severe disease.\nAs we shared in the past, this is our strategy for capital allocation. As David said, the priority #1 is and remains to invest in the company. We have this unique mRNA platform. And we have $17 billion to invest to grow our pipeline to launch new medicine and to expand the capabilities of our platform. Priority #2 is to expand the platform by in-licensing or M&A as we see new interesting nucleic acid technologies that can complement and strengthen the Moderan platform. Priority #3 is to return capital to shareholders. After completing August 2021 $1 billion share buyback plan and reducing our share count for the first time, we announced this morning a new $3 billion share buyback.\nAs we grow Moderna, we care deeply about building the right company, which is a responsible company to its community. In 2021, 25% of doses we shipped were to low and middle income countries. We're investing in Moderna Science Center in Cambridge and launching an academy. We plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions globally by 2030. We've announced Moderna Charitable Foundation and the global fellowship program. And we announced plans to invest up to [$500] million in manufacturing facility in Africa. We hope to be able to announce some positive developments soon about these exciting projects. We will continue to push the bond rate of corporate social responsibilities and share this with you.\nBefore taking your questions, we'd like to remind you our 2022 events. March 24 will be our annual Vaccine Day. May 17 will be our Annual Science Day, where we'll present new platform advances. September 8 will be our annual R&D, day where we present development pipeline key updates. And today, we're announcing that we'll be hosting our first ESG Day on November 10.\nI would have to close by sharing how excited we are about the future of our company. Because mRNA is an information molecule, we always knew this will be a company with 0 drug approach or not. Well, now we know which future it will be. We are passionate about our ability to have a profound impact on humanity. We believe nobody should be hospitalized because of a respiratory virus. We have the technology to do that. We believe nobody should have medical consequences short term or long term because of a latent virus. We have a technology to do that. We believe we can have a profound impact on disease treatments with our therapeutics first and vendor gene-editing programs. This is just the beginning.\nOperator, we'll be happy to take your questions.",

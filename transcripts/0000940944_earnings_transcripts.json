For example, in the current environment, more guests are seeking price certainty, and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse introduced a 5-week limited time offer featuring a 3-course menu that drove positive comps for the quarter. For $55, guests could select 1 of 3 entrees as well as a super salad, an individual side and dessert.

Before I hand over to Sascha, please pay attention to our usual disclaimer, which is part of our presentation. Thank you very much. Now, it's my pleasure to hand over to Sascha.\n\nThank you, Oliver. Good morning. This is Sascha D'Avis, CFO of 1&1 AG. Welcome to our call today. As Oliver has already mentioned, I would like to provide you with an update on our performance in the third quarter, as well as our financials at the end of September. Let's start with the customer contracts. As of the end of September, we had a total of 16.34 million contracts in our base, 12.48 million mobile internet contracts, and 3.86 million broadband contracts. This represents a decrease of 50,000 contracts in the first nine months of 2025. While we recorded a decline of 90,000 contracts in the fixed-line segment, we were able to increase our mobile contracts by 40,000 after a flat development until the beginning of the third quarter. We continue to experience intense competitive pressures in all areas.\n\nIn the mobile business, we saw an increase in contract cancellations due to the now successfully completed migration of all mobile customers to the new 1&1 network. However, in the third quarter, we managed to increase the number of our mobile contracts again. Please allow me to say a few words to conclude the migration. Less than two years after launching mobile services on the 1&1 Open RAN, we have completed the largest customer migration in German mobile communication history. All 1&1 customers now use the modern 5G network. This means that 1&1 has fulfilled the competitive independence requirement imposed by the Federal Network Agency ahead of the set deadline. On the next slide, I will move to revenue. Total revenue for 2025 amounts to EUR 3.016 billion, roughly in line with the previous year's level.\n\nService revenues have remained stable as projected, while other revenues, mainly from the low-margin hardware business, declined by 0.3%. This part of the business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and depends largely on the appeal of new devices, and the product cycles of the manufacturers. Let us move on to EBITDA by segments. In the access segment, we achieved an EBITDA of EUR 611 million in the first nine months, representing a decrease of 3% compared to EUR 630.1 million in the comparable period in 2024. The decline is mainly due to higher wholesale costs resulting from Vodafone's slower-than-expected network expansion, as well as the switch of the national roaming partner from Telefónica to Vodafone.\n\nUnder the commercially equivalent national roaming agreement with Vodafone, the capacities used by 1&1 are fully recognized and affect EBITDA directly, whereas under the national roaming arrangement with Telefónica, they were partly capitalized and depreciated as planned. The negative EBITDA of minus EUR 201.2 million in the 1&1 mobile network segment reflects our activities related to the expansion and operation of the mobile network. It also includes the cost associated with the successfully completed migration of existing customers. Now, let's move on to investments, CapEx. In the first nine months, we invested EUR 228.7 million, of which EUR 11.2 million were allocated to the excess segment, and EUR 217.5 million were dedicated to the expansion of our mobile network. Now, let us move to the current status of our mobile network, Europe's first open RAN. The slide shows the already familiar network architecture.\n\nIn addition to the four central core data centers and the 24 decentralized edge data centers that have been completed for some time, as of 30 September 2025, a total of 297 regional four-edge data centers and around 1,500 antenna sites are in operation. Another 4,500 antenna sites are currently under development. Network expansion is therefore continuing to progress well. Our Open RAN offers significant advantages over conventional network architecture. On the one hand, it features an open system with standard-sized interfaces supported by a partner ecosystem of nearly 100 companies, providing independence from dominant vendors. In addition, we are ready for real-time application as all antennas are connected via fiber. This enables data processing directly on-site in the four-edge data centers. The open network architecture also creates potential energy savings of between 10% and 30% compared to a traditional network.\n\nOn the next slides, you can see that our strength stems not only from our people, but also from a broad and resilient ecosystem. With more than 3,100 dedicated employees across eight locations in Germany, we provide the foundation for innovation and sustainable growth. At the same time, our success extends well beyond the boundaries of our own organization. More than 100 partners are part of our network, roughly half based in Germany, 40% from other European countries, and the remainder from global markets. This diversity enables us to respond swiftly to new demands, and to develop forward-looking solutions in close collaboration with strong partners. We have chosen to operate entirely without Chinese suppliers. Let us now turn to the financial figures, starting with the earnings situation. Total revenue in 2025 stands at approximately EUR 3.016 billion, roughly at the same level as the previous year.\n\nService revenue, as forecasted, also matches the prior year's figure. The cost of sales increased from EUR 2.191 billion in 2024 to EUR 2.301 billion in the first nine months of 2025. The increase is primarily driven by the 1&1 mobile network segment. In particular, depreciation on network components has risen due to the ongoing expansion of the network. The gross profit in the operational excess segment decreased from EUR 1.046 billion in the first nine months of 2024 to EUR 1.030 billion in the first nine months of 2025, representing a decline of 1.5%. This includes the connectivity costs for the fixed-line segment, which remain largely at the same level as the previous year. Connectivity costs for mobile internet have risen moderately. The prices for Vodafone national roaming were slightly above our expectations, which is due to slower growth of the Vodafone network.\n\nThe cost of goods sold has decreased in line with a decline in hardware revenue. The gross profit from revenue consequently decreased from EUR 826 million in the third quarter of 2024 to EUR 715 million in the third quarter of 2025, representing a decline of 30.5%. Distribution costs increased from EUR 390.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 to EUR 392.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, representing a rise of 0.5%. This is primarily due to the intensified marketing of our unlimited plans during the first half of 2025. Administration costs amounted to EUR 89.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, slightly above the prior year figure of EUR 86 million. The balance of other income and expenses amounted to EUR 34 million, exceeding the prior year's figure of EUR 27.6 million.\n\nThis change is primarily attributable to improved results from the collection process. Impairment losses on receivables and contract assets increased from EUR -89.9 million in Q3 2024 to EUR -91.9 million in the first three quarters of 2025. A portion of this is offset by the four mentioned higher income from the improved collection process. The operating profit, EBIT, amounted to EUR 175.4 million in the first three quarters of 2025 compared to EUR 287.5 million in the first three quarters of 2024. The decline is primarily attributable to the increased number of antenna sites in the 1&1 mobile network. The financial result in the first three quarters of 2025 stood at EUR -16.3 million compared to EUR -1 million in the previous year.\n\nThis is due to the financing expenses of minus EUR 27.5 million, up from minus EUR 30.8 million in the prior year, and financial income of EUR 11.2 million, down from EUR 12.8 million in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in financing expenses is partly due to the accounting of lease agreements for our growing number of antenna sites. Additionally, since the beginning of the 2025 fiscal year, there have been additional interest expenses from the loan taken out at the start of the year from the Japanese development bank, JBIC. This loan is being used to co-finance strategic investments as part of the network's expansion. Formerly, the loan was taken out by United Internet and passed on to 1&1.\n\nFinancial income amounted to EUR 11.2 million in the first nine months of the 2025 fiscal year, and, as in the previous year, was primarily derived from interest on investments with United Internet AG. The decline is attributable to the lower interest rate level compared to the first nine months of the 2024 fiscal year. Of the total EUR 800 million credit facility, we have so far drawn EUR 290 million, resulting in interest expenses of EUR 6.2 million in the first nine months of 2025. The interest income, primarily from the investments of free liquidity with United Internet, decreased by EUR 1.6 million due to lower interest rates. As a result, earnings before taxes amounted to EUR 159.1 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to EUR 286.5 million in 2024.\n\nCorrespondingly, tax expenses decreased to EUR 48.4 million in 2025, down from EUR 90.2 million in the same period of 2024. Consequently, we achieved a consolidated net income of EUR 110.7 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to EUR 196.3 million in Q3 2024. Let's now turn to the balance sheet. The total assets increased from EUR 8.13 billion at the end of 2024 to EUR 8.55 billion as of 30 September 2025. The increase of ±5.1% is primarily attributable to the following effects. Current assets amounted to EUR 1.84 billion at the end of 2024 and increased by 17.6% to EUR 2.17 billion by Q3 2025. The increase is primarily attributable to EUR 447.8 million invested as free liquidity with United Internet AG, which resulted from both positive operating cash flow and the disbursement of the JBIC loan.\n\nConversely, current contract assets decreased by EUR 78.1 million due to the recent decline in hardware revenue. Non-current assets increased by 1.4% from EUR 6.29 billion at the end of 2024 to EUR 6.38 billion as of 13 September 2025. This increase is primarily due to the rise in property, plant, and equipment by EUR 177.6 million, driven by the continued ramp-up of the 1&1 mobile network. The increase is mainly attributable to capitalized usage rights for antenna sites. The decline in intangible assets by EUR 78.1 million is largely the result of scheduled amortization on assets capitalized during the purchase price allocation following the merger of Tyrrallion 1&1. Current liabilities increased from EUR 730.6 million as of 31 December 2024 to EUR 739 million as of 30 September 2025.\n\nThe decrease in liabilities to related parties and the increase in current other non-financial liabilities are primarily related to the reporting of our VIT liabilities. Until 31 December 2024, 1&1 was part of the VIT group of United Internet, so our VIT liabilities were reported under liabilities to related parties. Since 1 January 2025, 1&1 is no longer part of this VIT group, and VIT liabilities are now reported under current other non-financial liabilities. The increase in current other financial liabilities is mainly due to the short-term payable installments for the frequency cost auctioned in 2019. The first installment for the 2 gigahertz frequency block is due on 1 January 2026, thereby increasing the short-term portion of frequency liabilities. Non-current liabilities increased from EUR 1.305 billion at the end of 2024 to EUR 1.607 billion in Q3 2025.\n\nThis increase is primarily due to the loan taken out to finance investments in the 1&1 mobile network. Additionally, lease liabilities rose as a result of the continued expansion of antenna sites within the 1&1 mobile network. Conversely, non-current financial liabilities decreased due to the reclassification of the short-term portion of the frequency liabilities. Equity increased from EUR 6.094 billion to EUR 6.199 billion due to the positive consolidated net income. Let's now turn to cash flow. Net cash flow inflows from operating activities amounted to EUR 432.7 million in the first three quarters of 2025, compared to EUR 133.8 million in the first nine months of 2024. The positive change compared to the previous year is primarily due to the advance payments made in the prior year for the contingent contract with Deutsche Telekom, which no longer apply in 2025.\n\nThe operating cash flow for the first half of 2025 includes the following key components: plus EUR 31.8 million from the reduction of inventories, minus EUR 43.1 million from changes in receivables and liabilities to related parties, and plus EUR 55.6 million from changes in other liabilities. These changes are primarily due to adjustments in the VIT group structure: minus EUR 60.6 million from changes in trade payables, plus EUR 70.3 million from changes in contract assets, plus EUR 29.7 million from changes in income tax receivables and liabilities, plus EUR 0.7 million from changes in other working capital. The cash flow from investing activities amounted to minus EUR 673.8 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to minus EUR 73.7 million in the same period of 2024.\n\nThis is composed as follows: minus EUR 228.7 million in cash CapEx for 2025, primarily related to investments in the 1&1 mobile network, minus EUR 4 million for the acquisition of AINS Marketing Communication and Neue Medien GmbH, minus EUR 450.5 million from the investments of free liquidity with United Internet, plus EUR 9.6 million in interest income from the investments of funds with United Internet. The cash flow financing activities amounted to EUR 240.2 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to minus EUR 59.3 million in the prior year. This is broken down as follows: minus EUR 14.5 million from the repayment of lease liabilities, minus EUR 8.8 million from dividend payments, minus EUR 5.8 million from other interest-related payments, plus EUR 290 million from loan proceeds, minus EUR 20.7 million in interest payments.\n\nAs a result, we achieved a free cash flow of EUR 204 million in the first nine months of 2025, a significant increase compared to EUR 63 million in the same period of 2024. On the next slide, we present the bridge from EBITDA to free cash flow. We start with an EBITDA of EUR 409.8 million. Change in inventories contributed ±EUR 31.8 million. The decrease in contract assets amounted to ±EUR 70.3 million. Changes in receivables and liabilities to related parties resulted in -EUR 43.1 million. The reduction in trade payables had an impact of -EUR 60.1 million. The increase in other liabilities contributed ±EUR 55.6 million. Other working capital changes amounted to ±EUR 4.3 million. Tax payments totaled -EUR 35.4 million. Investment CapEx amounted to -EUR 228.7 million.\n\nThis result is a total free cash flow of ±EUR 204 million. Let us now conclude with a forecast for the 2025 fiscal year. With a stable contract base, service revenue is expected to remain at the prior year's level of approximately EUR 3.3 billion. EBITDA is projected to decline by approximately 7.7% to around EUR 545 million compared to EUR 590.8 million in 2024. Segment-specific expectations, exit segment, EBITDA is expected to decrease to approximately EUR 810 million, down from EUR 856.1 million in 2024. The decline is primarily due to higher-than-planned primarily costs for national roaming with Vodafone, resulting from slower-than-expected network growth at Vodafone, and approximately -EUR 20 million related to the transition to a new national roaming provider, which has no impact on EBIT. 1&1 mobile network segment, EBITDA is expected to be around -EUR 265 million, 2024, -EUR 265.3 million.\n\nThis includes approximately ±100 million EUR in migration expenses and temporary network prepayments, which will no longer apply or will be reduced after the migration of all customers. Investment volume, cash CapEx, is projected to be approximately 400 million EUR. In 2024, it was 290.6 million EUR, primarily driven by the network expansion. The initial forecast of approximately 450 million EUR has been revised. Thank you for your attention so far. I would now like to hand over to the operator to open the Q&A session. Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star 1&1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. Once you've asked your question, please ensure you mute your line to prevent background noise. To withdraw your question, please press star 1&1 again. We will now go to the first question."

Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Phil MacLean, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Phil.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 20, before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nDuring today's call, all references to industry results refer to the Black Box Intelligence, casual dining benchmark excluding Darden. During our fiscal second quarter, industry same-restaurant sales grew by 1% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 1.8%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2025 financial outlook.\nNow I will turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter that met our expectations. Same-restaurant sales at 3 of our 4 segments were positive and all of our brands remained intensely focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. I was pleased that our 4 largest brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, all generated positive same-restaurant sales for the quarter. During the quarter, the Olive Garden team's ongoing focus on being growing with the basics, combined with great execution of an extended never earning possible, drove a positive sales gap to the industry. Never Ending Pasta Bowl starting at price point of $13.99, marking the third consecutive year at that price point and making it an even more compelling value for our guests. NEPB was once again well received as evidenced by the highest refill rate ever in higher protein add-ons compared to last year.\nIn October, Olive Garden launched its Uber Direct pilot in approximately 100 restaurants. They are not promoting it yet in order to focus on the technology integration and operational execution. The pilot has gone very well, thanks to the operators in the pilot restaurants, the Olive Garden Operations Excellence team and the Darden IT team. Olive Garden is on track to begin rolling it out to the rest of the system after the holidays with potential completion by the end of the third quarter. Olive Garden is a brand that is well positioned to leverage news to drive traffic, and the team has been working on several initiatives to continue appealing to core guests as well as value seekers.\nOne of these initiatives is an updated menu that launched 2 weeks ago, featuring the return of 2 fan favorites, State Gorgon Zola and Stuff Chicken Marcela. These dishes were the most requested entrees that fans asked Olive Garden to bring back and the initial response from guests is encouraging. Starting in January, Olive Garden's advertising will feature the return of these fan favorites and an additional guest driving news at compelling price point. LongHorn continues to exceed expectations, driven by great guest value and strong operational execution. The LongHorn team is extremely passionate about serving the highest quality stakes in casual dining, which not only requires grilling each stake perfectly, but also having the highest quality product.\nDuring the quarter, LongHorn hosted their first Steak Cutter summit with their suppliers from across the country to review their custom specifications and immerse their partners in the LongHorn business and culture. The summit ended with one supplier receiving the Golden Steak Award for the best adherence to LongHorn standards. And all of the partners left the event more aligned and better positioned to consistently meet the brand's expectations. After receiving steaks that meet their stringent quality specifications is set to LongHorn team members to grow them to perfection. That's why the LongHorn team validates their Grill Masters expertise each year regularly retrains on how to correctly season their stakes and ensures their managers verify that each steak is grilled to the right temperature.\nThis focus continues to pay off and resulted in an all-time high steaks real correctly store during the quarter. The performance of Yard House and Cheddar's drove positive comps within our Other segment. Yard House has built a competitive advantage of distinctive culinary offerings with broad appeal through a range of approachable and trend-forward items. One example of how they bring this to life is the [indiscernible] sliders that were featured during October fest, which helped drive further sales momentum for the brand during the quarter. The Yard House team is well positioned to build on their momentum with new food news during the third quarter. The Cheddar's team leverages efficiency and Darden's purchasing power to provide great food served with speed at a wow price. One way to achieve this is by capitalizing on lower cost opportunity buys to create limited time offers.\nDuring the quarter, 2 LTOs returned to their menu. Their Texas T-bone for $21.49 and which was followed by their bone-in ribeye for $22.49. And each of these entrees also include honey butter cussance and 2 sides for that price. I'm proud of the momentum the Cheddar's team is building. During the quarter, they achieved their best-ever retention level already exceeding their annual goal. Also, in Technomic's most recent survey, their value score once again outperformed the casual dining category and Cheddar's ranked first among casual dining brands for affordability.\nNow let me provide a brief update on Chuy's. We successfully closed the transaction during the quarter, and the leadership team, including Chuy's President, Steve Hislop; and our operations leader, John Corman, is in place. The integration process has just begun and is being led by the same team that successfully directed the Ruth's Chris integration. They are focused on 3 key objectives: preserving the employee experience and Chuy's a unique culture, maintaining the guest experience and successfully migrating Chuy's onto the Darden platform with as few disruptions as possible. The time line for this integration will likely be a little longer than the one for Ruth Chris because we are about to begin rolling out the next generation of our point-of-sale system.\nThis system currently supports 9 different brands and is the nerve center for our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights. This is not an off-the-shelf product Rather, it's a proprietary system that we first built more than 20 years ago and continued to maintain enhance ourselves. It's integrated with all of our key restaurant applications and also has a number of great features that are designed to make our managers' jobs easier deliver key data to help enhance operations and ensure labor compliance.\nOur IT team has been working for some time to completely rewrite and modernize the application in order to provide an improved and more modern user interface implement updated technology architecture, offer the ability to operate on different types of hardware and deliver near real-time analytics. All of this will reduce training time for our new team members drive speed by reducing number of clicks required to enter orders as well as other tasks, enable our IT team to respond faster to requests for system enhancements and further strengthen our competitive advantages of significant scale and extensive data and insights. The learning we capture from rolling it out will help minimize disruptions when we bring it online at Chuy's.\nDuring the second quarter, we also experienced meaningful impacts from hurricanes, Helene and Milton. Our operations teams and our severe weather task force did an outstanding job ensuring our restaurants were prepared for the storms and able to reopen quickly. Only one restaurant, the Cheddar's in Asheville, North Carolina has been unable to reopen due to the damages sustained. We expect to reopen this restaurant next fiscal year. Hurricane Helene's impact was felt across multiple states, while Hurricane Milton left a path of destruction across Florida, each affecting our team members and guests. As a company that cares, one of the ways we nourish and delight everyone we serve is by responding to help others in times of need. That's why Darden is a proud partner of the American Red Cross. Each year, the Darden Foundation provides a $500,000 grant to their annual disaster giving program. The program enables the Red Cross to prepare communities for disasters like Helene and Milton and respond to help families during the recovery process. Our team members can count on this as well. Nothing represents the strength of our culture, quite like Darden dones. Our signature employee giving program that enables team members across our family of restaurants and at the restaurant support center to support their fellow coworkers when the unexpected happens. We are grateful that all of our team members in the affected areas are safe, and we moved quickly to help those who were hardest hit. Darden Dimes provided grants totaling $1.1 million to more than 5,600 impacted team members.\nAs I reflect on the quarter, I continue to believe in the power of our strategy and our brand's ability to compete effectively regardless of the environment. Each one of our brand leadership teams is focused on the long term and staying committed to our back-to-basics operating philosophy. I am proud of the way our teams performed throughout the second quarter, and now we are in the midst of the busiest time of the year for our restaurants as they nourish and delight our guests and create lasting holiday memories. On behalf of our leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 195,000 team members. I wish you and your families a happy holiday season and hope to see you in our restaurants.\nNow I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter earnings results were in line with our expectations with positive same-restaurant sales that our 4 largest brands. The Thanksgiving shift to the third quarter this year caused the sales benefit for the casual dining brands and a headwind for our Fine Dining brands in the second quarter. However, even when adjusting for the benefit of the Thanksgiving holiday shift at our 4 largest brands, same restaurant sales were still positive.\nIn the second quarter, we generated $2.9 billion of total sales, 6% higher than last year, driven by same-restaurant sales of 2.4%, the acquisition of 103 Chuy's restaurants on October 11 and the addition of 39 net new restaurants. The Thanksgiving holiday shift contributed approximately 90 basis points to the same Russian sales for the quarter but was partially offset by a negative 30 basis points impact from hurricanes Helene and Melton. We outperformed the industry benchmarks again this quarter. Same restaurant sales were 140 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts also exceeded the industry by 140 basis points. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.03 were 10% higher than last year. We generated $445 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned $308 million to our shareholders, paying $166 million in dividends and $142 million in share repurchases.\nNow looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points lower, driven by the pricing leverage as commodities were slightly deflationary and they were better than our expectations. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points lower with productivity improvements and sales leverage from the Thanksgiving shift more than offsetting the total labor inflation of 3.7%, which was well above our pricing. Restaurant expenses were flat. Marketing expenses were 30 basis points higher driven by increased media spending due to more weeks of never-ending possible, which we -- while we remain disciplined in how we spend our marketing dollars.\nOur restaurant level EBITDA of 19.5% for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year. Adjusted G&A expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year as unfavorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation caused 20 basis points increase for the quarter. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this unfavorability is largely offset in the tax line. Interest expense increased 20 basis points driven by the financing expenses related to the Chuy's acquisition and other cash needs. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 12.3%, which includes the favorable impact on the mark-to-market hedge I referenced earlier. Our effective tax rate would have been approximately 14% without the impact of mark-to-market.\nIn total, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $240 million, which was 8.3% of sales, and 20 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments for the quarter. Total sales for Olive Garden increased by 3.3%, driven by same restaurant sales of 2% and outperforming the industry benchmark by 100 basis points. Last year, Olive Garden same-restaurant sales were 4.1% in the second quarter. On a 2-year basis, Olive Garden has grown same-restaurant sales by over 6%, exceeding the industry benchmark by 640 basis points over that period.\nOlive Garden continues to have strong segment profit margin, delivering 21.4% for the quarter, which is 40 basis points higher than last year. At LongHorn, total sales increased 10.4%, driven mostly by same-restaurant sales growth of 7.5%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 650 basis points. These results build on strong results from Q2 last year, where they had same-restaurant sales of 4.9%. Leverage from the strong sales growth resulted in segment profit margin of 18.9%, 150 basis points above last year.\nTotal sales at the Fine Dining segment decreased 3.8% as same-restaurant sales were negative at all of our Fine Dining brands for the quarter. Thanksgiving is a busy day for our Fine Dining brands and the shift of this holiday from the second quarter last year into the third quarter this year, combined with the hurricanes resulted in an approximately 200 basis points of negative impact to same restaurant sales. Adjusted for these impacts, fine dining same-restaurant sales decreased approximately 3.8%, which was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The negative sales growth resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The Other business segment sales increased by 12.9% and driven by the acquisition of Chuy's and positive same-restaurant sales of 0.7%. Segment profit margin of 13.6% was 70 basis points better than last year.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2025. We updated our guidance to reflect the acquisition of Chuy's, our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. As a reminder, same-restaurant sales for the year do not include Ruth's Chris steak house [indiscernible] this because they were not owned and operated by Darden for a 16-month period at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we now expect total sales of approximately $12.1 billion, including approximately $300 million from Chuy's. Same-restaurant sales growth of approximately 1.5%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $650 million; total inflation of approximately 2.5%, including commodities inflation of approximately 1% and an annual effective tax rate of approximately 12.5%, approximately 118 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in no change to our adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $9.40 to $9.60, which excludes approximately $47 million of pretax transaction and integration-related costs.\nLooking at the back half of the fiscal year, we expect sales and EPS growth rates to be lower in Q3 than the growth rates in Q4, given the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday shift into the third quarter. Finally, as we expected, we closed on the Chuy's deal in October, acquiring 103 Chuy's restaurants. We're in the early stages, but the integration is going well, and we now expect to realize run rate synergies of approximately $17 million, with approximately $2 million realized in fiscal 2025 and the balance in fiscal 2026. As we mentioned previously, we anticipate the transaction will be neutral to our adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year, not including transaction and integration-related expenses. We're very pleased with the actions our brand teams are taking to address their guest needs and deliver strong results. We'll continue to [indiscernible] to our strategy and have confidence in the strength of our business model.\nNow we'll open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Courtney Aquilla, Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Courtney, please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Aquilla\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2026 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 18, before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nDuring today's call, I'll reference to the industry results refer to the Black Box Intelligence, casual dining benchmark excluding Darden. During the fiscal fourth quarter, average same-restaurant sales for the industry grew 3.0% and average same-restaurant guest counts grew 0.9%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter. Raj will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as share our fiscal 2026 financial outlook. Then Rick will close with some final comments.\nNow I will turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Courtney, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter with same-restaurant sales and earnings growth that exceeded our expectations. I'm proud of the great work by our restaurant teams throughout the quarter, particularly on Mother's Day as several brands achieved sales records for that day. The return of Olive Garden's buy one take one offer for the first time in 5 years, combined with the continued strength of off-premise, drove their impressive sales during the quarter. Olive Garden's marketing strategy to meaningfully communicate strong value, create urgency and introduce food news continue to resonate as guests are motivated by news and compelling price points.\nBuy one take one with a starting price point of $14.99 allowed guests to choose one entree for their dining experience and then take a second one home. The take-home selections leveraged Olive Garden's existing $6 take-home platform, minimizing operational complexity. During buy one take one, Olive Garden same-restaurant sales gap versus the industry increased to 450 basis points.\nWith delivery available nationwide, the entire quarter, Olive Garden continued to see order volume grow week-to-week while retaining higher-than-average sales per transaction versus curbside pickup orders. This, combined with continued growth in catering and curbside to go, drove overall takeout sales to grow nearly 20% over last year.\nAt the end of the quarter, Olive Garden launched a campaign to promote delivery across multiple channels, including television advertising, with a compelling and memorable offer, 1 million free deliveries, partially funded by Uber. We continue to see strong incrementality with average weekly deliveries per restaurant nearly doubling during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. The Olive Garden team continued to execute at a high level, which led to an all-time high guest satisfaction score for the quarter. I am extremely proud of how Dan Kiernan and his team managed the business throughout the year and the strong momentum they have generated heading into the new fiscal year.\nAt LongHorn Steakhouse, the ongoing commitment to quality, simplicity and culture continues to drive their momentum. Their entire team remains obsessed with serving the highest quality stakes in casual dining. This includes having industry-leading specifications and ensuring they perfectly season and grill every stake they serve. To support this, during the quarter, Olive Garden validated each one of their Grill Master's expertise with the 8th Annual Steak Master series, their internal drilling competition and training program.\nCongratulations to Tim Crane from the LongHorn Steakhouse Independents Missouri who claim the Championship Trophy. This focus on ongoing training continues to pay off as LongHorn ended the year with an all-time high stakes will correctly score as well as a new all-time high guest satisfaction score for the quarter. Laura Williamson and her team have done a great job of building on the business momentum at LongHorn.\nFor the fiscal year, the same-restaurant sales increased 5.1%, and they reached a major milestone by surpassing $3 billion in total sales. These results reflect the strength of their focused strategy. Last quarter, we announced Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen have begun piloting Uber Direct. It was a successful pilot. And as of last week, delivery is now available in all but 8 Chuy's restaurants. Paid media and e-mail support began earlier this week, partially funded by Uber.\nThe Cheddar's marketing team also continues to build on its use of connected television debuting the first 30-second spot in Cheddar's history during the quarter. The spot was developed at no cost at Darden, thanks to the scale of our CTV media spend across our portfolio. In addition to Olive Garden LongHorn, Cheddar's also received an all-time high guest satisfaction score for the quarter, as did Ruth's Chris Steak House and Eddie V's.\nWe know that engaged well-trained team members helped drive operational success and 2 of our brands were recognized for their people practices during the quarter. Longhorn and the Capital Grille received the Employer of Choice Awards from Black Box Intelligence, for casual dining and fine dining, respectively. The award recognizes exemplary performance in managing turnover rates, fostering an inclusive workplace culture and implementing best-in-class people practices.\nOverall, I am pleased with our results. Our adherence to our winning strategy anchored in our 4 competitive advantages and being growing with the basics, led to a successful year. Our strategy remains the right one for the company, and we will continue to execute it to drive growth and long-term shareholder value.\nNow I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick said, fiscal 2025 was another strong year, driven by disciplined execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, same-restaurant sales continued the sequential improvement from prior quarters with our casual brands gaining significant market share. This resulted in sales and earnings exceeding our expectations for the quarter. Furthermore, we finished the year with same-restaurant sales at the top of our initial guidance range and earnings in the upper half of the range despite the slower-than-expected start to the year.\nNow looking at the fourth quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of total sales, 10.6% higher than prior year. This was driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.6% with positive traffic growth, the acquisition of 103 Chuy's restaurants and the addition of 25 net new restaurants, which includes the permanent closure of 22 underperforming restaurants. Same-restaurant sales exceeded the industry benchmark for the quarter and were in the top decile of the industry.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12.5% to $2.98. We generated $582 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned $215 million to shareholders through $164 million in dividends and $51 million of share repurchases.\nTurning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 60 basis points lower as commodities inflation was better than expected at approximately 1.5%. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points lower as productivity gains more than offset higher performance-based compensation and pricing below total labor inflation of approximately 3.5%. Restaurant expenses were 20 basis points higher driven by brand mix with the addition of Chuy's and the impact of first-party delivery at Olive Garden, partially offset by sales leverage.\nMarketing expenses were flat at 1.3% of sales consistent with our expectations. This all resulted in rational level EBITDA for the quarter, improving 50 basis points to 21.6%. Preopening costs were 10 basis points higher as we accelerated our new restaurant pipeline opening 19 restaurants during the quarter.\nAdjusted G&A expenses were 30 basis points higher due to higher incentive compensation accrual compared to the fourth quarter last year and unfavorable mark-to-market expenses on our deferred compensation. Because of the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this is largely offset in the tax line. Interest expense increased 20 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Chuy's acquisition. And our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.2%, with tax expenses down 20 basis points because of the mark-to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier.\nIn total, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $352 million, which was 10.7% of sales. In the fourth quarter, all of our segments grew total sales with 3 of the 4 segments growing same-restaurant sales and segment profit margin. Olive Garden increased total sales for the quarter by 8.1% with strong same-restaurant sales growth of 6.9% and the addition of 15 net new restaurants. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 390 basis points for the quarter.\nUber direct delivery fees positively benefited check mix by about 40 basis points in the quarter. These fees were passed on to Uber with the revenue fully offset in restaurant expenses. Olive Garden continues to have industry-leading segment profit margin, delivering 23.8% for the quarter, which is 100 basis points higher than last year.\nAt LongHorn, total sales increased 9.3%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 6.7% and the addition of 16 net new restaurants. LongHorn continues to increase market share with strong and sustained sales growth exceeding the industry same-restaurant sales benchmark by 370 basis points this quarter and 850 basis points on a 2-year basis.\nSegment profit margin for the quarter was 20.1%, 80 basis points above last year. Total sales for Fine Dining segment increased 2.3%, driven by the addition of 6 net new restaurants, which includes the permanent closure of 2 underperforming restaurants. Same-restaurant sales were negative for the quarter, resulting in segment profit margin lower than last year. While the Fine Dining category as a whole continues to be challenged, we are seeing sequential improvement in guest traffic from households earning $150,000 and above.\nTotal sales for the Other Business segment increased 22.4% with the acquisition of Chuy's and positive same-restaurant sales at Yard House and Cheddar's. This positive growth was partially offset by the permanent closure of 20 restaurants during the quarter, including 15 Bahama Breeze restaurants. Positive sales momentum and continued productivity improvements at Yard House and Cheddar's contributed to a 17.5% segment profit margin for the Other Business segment, 10 basis points higher than last year. The integration of Chuy's is progressing as planned with synergies on track and a neutral impact to EPS for fiscal 2025, which is in line with our expectations.\nAs we look at our annual results for fiscal 2025, we had same-restaurant sales growth of 2%, outperforming the industry by 170 basis points. Total sales increased 6%, surpassing $12 billion for the first time in our history. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7.5% to $9.55. We delivered $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations driven by strong sales growth, and we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders with $659 million in dividends and $418 million in share repurchases.\nLooking at our fiscal 2025 full year P&L. Restaurant-level EBITDA grew 40 basis points, driven by disciplined cost management and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by the increased depreciation and amortization expense, resulting in operating income margin that was 10 basis points higher than last year.\nFinancing expenses related to Chuy's acquisition increased adjusted interest expense 20 basis points from last year. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4%, which was 10 basis points below last year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we permanently closed 15 underperforming Bahama Breeze restaurants as well as a few restaurants at other brands. These closures will result in a headwind to our fiscal 2026 total sales growth but are expected to be slightly positive to earnings. Fiscal 2026 is a 53-week year and we anticipate a positive impact from the extra week on diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $0.20.\nNow turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2026. We expect total sales growth of 7% to 8%, including approximately 2% from the additional week; same-restaurant sales growth of 2% to 3.5%, and opening 60 to 65 new restaurants; capital spending between $700 million and $750 million; total inflation of 2.5% to 3% with commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% and total labor inflation of approximately 3.5%; EBITDA of $2.16 billion to $2.19 billion; and an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately $117 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $10.50 and $10.70. This morning, we also announced that our Board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, implying an annual dividend of $6.\nNow turning to our long-term financial framework, which outlines the strategic priorities and performance expectations that guide our sustained value creation. We remain committed to delivering 10% to 15% total shareholder return as defined by EPS growth plus dividend yield. However, we're updating the framework to reflect a greater emphasis on sales growth with appropriate investments while maintaining our growing margins.\nAs a result, we're increasing new restaurant growth to 3% to 4%, and same restaurant sales growth to 1.5% to 3.5%. Additionally, we're updating how we define margin expansion, shifting from EBIT margin to earnings after tax margin to more accurately reflect how we view and manage our business. There are 3 primary drivers of this change.\nFirst, due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation, the impact in G&A is largely offset in the tax line. Second, current lease accounting guidelines result in an ongoing negative impact to interest and depreciation with an offsetting benefit in restaurant expense. And third, to account for any interest expense associated with any future acquisitions.\nOur updated framework targets [indiscernible] margin growth to be flat to 20 basis points. This all results in [indiscernible] growth contributing 6% to 10% of total shareholder return. Our dividend remains a priority, and the target payout ratio range of 50% to 60% remains unchanged. Share repurchase is being updated from a dollar range to a percentage range of contribution to shareholder return. Return of cash is now targeted to contribute 4% to 5% of total shareholder return.\nLooking at our performance since 2019 relative to the updated framework, new restaurant growth inclusive of acquisition was within the updated range having grown 3.1%. Same-restaurant sales of 2.9% is in the top half of the target range and [indiscernible] margin expansion was above the midpoint of the updated range, increasing 13 basis points on an annualized basis, resulting in an annualized [indiscernible] growth of 7.6% near the middle of the range.\nThe dividend payout ratio of 58% is near the top end of the range and share repurchase contribution to shareholder return was 1%, culminating in total cash return of 4.1% despite the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2020. Total shareholder return as defined by EPS growth plus dividend yield was 11.6% and within our targeted range. Additionally, our -- over our 30-year history as a publicly traded company, Darden has achieved an annualized total shareholder return of 10% or greater for any 10 fiscal year period when taking into account Darden's stock appreciation plus dividend yield.\nFinally, our strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since fiscal 2019, we've grown EBITDA by about $800 million and are on track to reach nearly $1 billion in EBITDA growth by the end of fiscal 2026. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2025 is well positioned with adjusted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.1x. This is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x despite the additional debt related to the acquisition of Chuy's and Ruth's Chris over the past 2 years.\nNow I'll turn it back to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Raj. Strategic planning is one of our competitive advantages. And at the Darden level, it ensures that we have the right portfolio of brands, we align strategies and coordinate operations to maximize our portfolio's value and we capture the available synergies across all our brands. For our brands, our strategic planning process allows us to determine the strategic role in the portfolio, identify their distinct advantages and cultivate differentiated positioning, develop a deep understanding of their guests and the competitive landscape, and ensure they adhere to their strategy so they can compete effectively and grow share.\nDuring the quarter, we completed our 5-year planning process. Each of our brands has a clear understanding of their role in their portfolio, and they have built a 5-year strategic plan based on that role, focusing on what they need to do to win today and into 2030. They have already begun to put their plans in action and will execute them to drive shareholder value. Additionally, there were some other key outcomes from that process that I would like to share.\nAs Raj mentioned, we made the decision to close 15 Bahama Breeze locations in May, leaving the 28 highest-performing Bahama Breeze restaurants in our portfolio. After further review, we have made the difficult decision that these remaining locations and the Bahama Breeze brand are not a strategic priority for us. We also believe that this brand and these restaurants have the potential to benefit from a new owner.\nConsequently, we will be considering strategic alternatives for Bahama Breeze, including a potential sale of the brand, or converting restaurants to other Darden brands. Excluding any onetime potential impacts, which are unknown as of today, we do not expect these strategic alternatives including a potential sale to have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe also signed a definitive agreement to sell the 8 Olive Garden locations in Canada to Recipe Unlimited, the largest full-service operator in Canada, and we are on track to close that deal soon. These 8 restaurants will become franchised and upon close, Darden and Recipe Unlimited will enter into an area development agreement to open 30 more Olive Gardens over the next 10 years. Their expertise in the Canadian market will help the Olive Garden better operate locally and accelerate the brand's ability to grow throughout the country.\nOur international franchising team led by Brad Smith, is focused on growing our global presence. Today, we have 154 franchise locations, which includes 63 in the Continental United States and 91 outside the Continental United States. One of the benefits of the Ruth's Chris acquisition was the scale it added to our franchise business. The increase in revenue from adding 74 Ruth's Chris franchise locations has allowed the team to grow faster. We were able to add the resources and systems to help our franchisees better operate our brands that would have taken us longer if we had not added the Ruth's Chris restaurants. And the team has been busy signing new area development agreements with international partners.\nIn addition to the agreement with Recipe Unlimited, we also have new agreements with partners in India and Spain, each of which calls for the development of 40 Olive Garden locations as well as an agreement with our existing Ruth's Chris franchise partner in Asia for the development of 6 Capital Grill locations. Brad and his team are doing a great job and I'm excited about the growth prospects of our international franchising business.\nAlso, as you may have seen from our 8-K filing this morning, after 33 years with Darden, Dan Kiernan will be retiring as President of Olive Garden on August 31. Dan has worked in the industry since he was 16 and began his career at Olive Garden as a manager in training. For the last 7 years, he has led Olive Garden to new heights and has been a tremendous steward of the brand. As I said earlier, Dan and his team have generated strong business momentum. And following the successful completion of their 5-year business plan, Olive Garden is well positioned for this leadership transition.\nOne of the benefits of our scale is having a deep bench of talent to fill leadership roles. I am pleased that we have another proven operator to lead Olive Garden. John Wilkerson who has led Cheddar's for the past 7 years, will be the next President of Olive Garden, and he will work closely with Dan over the next 10 weeks to ensure a smooth transition. John is a 30-year Darden veteran, who has done an excellent job of rebuilding the fundamentals at Cheddar's and setting the brand up for growth. John will continue reporting to me.\nJohn's replacement at Cheddar's is Mark Cooper, currently President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. Lorie Kessler, who has led operations at Seasons for 52 years -- excuse 52 -- for 11 years -- sorry, didn't want to age you, has been named President of Seasons 52. Mark and Lorie will report to John Martin, Group President. In addition to Cheddar's and Season 52, John Martin will retain responsibility for Yard House, the Capital Grille and Eddie V's. He will also lead Bahama Breeze as we consider strategic alternatives for the brand.\nAdditionally, I am pleased to share that Thomas Hall has been named President of Chuy's. For the past 7 years, Tom has served as Executive Vice President of Operations for LongHorn. Tom will report to Todd Burrows, Group President, who is responsible for Chuy's and Ruth's Chris as well as Darden development and international franchising teams. With these changes, I am confident we have the right leaders in place across all our brands to compete effectively and grow share.\nFinally, last month, Darden celebrated its 30th year as a publicly traded company. I was delighted to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange with several team members with 30 or more years of service, including Level Rutledge, our longest tenured team member at 52 years. That moment was a great reminder of an enduring quote from Bill Darden. He said the greatest edge we have on our competition is the quality of our employees reflected each day in the job they do. Our people drive our success, and I want to congratulate our teams on a strong quarter and a successful year.\nOn behalf of our leadership team and the Board of Directors, thank you for your continued dedication and commitment to nourishing and delighting our guests and each other. Now we'll take your questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nThis conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin, Kevin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis\n\nThank you, [ Kevin ]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call.\nJoining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\nAs a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation.

Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence, Casual Dining benchmark excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.\nDuring our fiscal third quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 4.2%, and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 6.5%.\nThis morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our results this quarter. Each one of our segments grew total sales and profit in an operating environment that was tougher than we anticipated. We continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic.\nTotal sales were $3 billion, an increase of 6.8%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $2.62, which was in line with our expectations.\nWe opened 16 restaurants during this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 43 restaurants in 22 states, 7 of which were reopenings.\nThe quarter started well with strong holiday performance in December, but unfavorable winter weather negatively impacted January traffic. And while February results improved, we experienced some underlying softness we had not seen in the months leading up to January. The lower income consumer does appear to be pulling back and the mix of guests based on income is now in line with pre-COVID. I am proud that even as industry traffic trends weakened, we were able to gain share.\nWe continue to focus on controlling what we can control. leveraging and strengthening our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere.\nOur restaurant teams continue to perform at their best, especially during our busiest times. In December, the capital growth set their all-time total monthly sales record. In February, Eddie V's set their all-time total weekly sales record, and Olive Garden established a new sales record for Valentine's Day.\nOur internal guest satisfaction metrics reflect our team's focus on being brilliant with the basics. All of our brands remained at or near all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter.\nAdditionally, within the casual dining, polished casual and fine dining segments of Technomic's industry tracking tool, the Darden brand was ranked #1 for overall experience. The brands were LongHorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52 and Ruth's Chris Steak House.\nOur team's ability to execute at a high level is driven by strong leadership and team member engagement across our brands. We work hard to ensure our results-oriented culture is a competitive advantage for us our industry-leading retention rates confirm it is in an area of strength.\nDuring the quarter, we completed our biannual engagement survey and the results showed that our overall level of engagement is at an all-time high. Also during the quarter, 3 of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in Black Box Intelligence, LongHorn, the Capital Grille and Season 52 each received the Employer of Choice Award.\nNow let me provide a quick update on Ruth's Chris. We are in the final stage of integration and remain on track to complete the major changes by the end of the fiscal year. We successfully completed the migration onto our HR platform at the end of December, and all restaurants have now successfully transitioned to our distribution network.\nCurrently, we are halfway through converting the restaurants over to our point-of-sale system and we are on track to complete that work by the end of May. This is the most challenging part of integration, and I'm really proud of the focus the Ruth's Chris team continues to have on delivering exceptional guest experiences. This can be seen in the fact that Ruth's Chris was named America's favorite chain restaurant in Technomic's annual survey that was released during the quarter. The survey measures, perceptions of service and hospitality, unit appearance and ambience food and beverage, convenience and value.\nIn addition to Ruth's Chris, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, LongHorn and the Capital Grille were all ranked in the top 10.\nOverall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. We continue to manage the business for the long term by executing against our strategy and controlling what we can control. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose: to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this is for our team members and their families is through our Next Course scholarship program.\nEarlier this month, the Darden Foundation awarded more than 100 post secondary education scholarships were $3,000 each to children of Darden team members. Education is one of the greatest equalizers in our country, and I'm thrilled that we can create a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families through this program.\nFinally, I want to thank our 190,000 team members for everything you do to create exceptional experiences for our guests. You are the reason brands continue to be recognized as great places to work and top dining destinations.\nNow I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone.\nThird quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, although our sales were softer than we anticipated. We were pleased with December's strong holiday performance as the month's same restaurant sales were in line with our second quarter results. However, winter weather in January negatively impacted traffic results by approximately 100 basis points for the quarter.\nAs we moved into February, sales trends improved but were below our expectations, exposing some underlying consumer weakness. Despite the unexpected variability in our sales trends, our teams did a great job managing their businesses.\nIn the third quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House, and 55 net new restaurants, which was partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1%. We outperformed the industry again this quarter with same-restaurant sales that were [ 320 ] basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts that were 270 basis points better. And on a 2-year basis, we have outperformed on same-restaurant sales by 770 basis points and by 970 basis points on same-restaurant guest counts.\nOur focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.62 in the quarter, an increase of 12% from last year's reported earnings per share.\nWe generated $512 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $190 million of capital to our shareholders through $157 million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases.\nNow looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation of approximately 1.5% was below our total pricing of approximately 3.5%.\nRestaurant labor was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year due to total labor inflation of approximately 4.5%, partially offset by pricing and productivity improvements at our brands. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points higher as sales deleverage was partially offset by strong cost management by our teams. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations.\nAll of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 20.6%, 70 basis points better than last year.\nG&A as a percent of sales was 40 basis points lower than last year, and total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance related to lower incentive compensation and ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris.\nInterest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations was 10.6% of sales, 30 basis points better than last year.\nLooking at our segments. Olive Garden increased total sales by 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth, partially offset by negative same restaurant sales of 1.8%. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 240 basis points and their traffic outperformed the industry by 270 basis points. Despite the negative same restaurant sales, Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.5% was flat to last year.\nAt LongHorn, total sales increased 5.1%, driven by new restaurant growth and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.3%. LongHorn same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 650 basis points. Segment profit margin of 18.7% was 130 basis points above last year, driven by pricing leverage and improved labor productivity.\nTotal sales at Fine Dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both Capital Grille and Eddie V's were negative as the Fine Dining category continued to be challenged year-over-year. Fine Dining segment profit margin was flat year-over-year at 21.8%.\nThe other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed location revenue but was partially offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 2.6% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 160 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 14.9% was 90 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and higher overall pricing related to inflation.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. We have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.4 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% to 2%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3% including commodities inflation of approximately 1.5%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in an increase to our adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.80 to $8.90, which excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration-related costs.\nFor the fourth quarter specifically, our annual outlook implies sales of $2.95 billion to $2.99 billion, same-restaurant sales between negative 0.5% and positive 1%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share between $2.58 and $2.68.\nNow looking forward into fiscal 2025, we plan on opening between 45 and 50 new restaurants and spending between $250 million and $300 million of capital for those new restaurants.\nAdditionally, we anticipate approximately $300 million of capital spending related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh and technology.\nAnd finally, we anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 13% for fiscal 2025.\nAnd now I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of our of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment.\nWith that, we'll open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\nAs a reminder, comments made during the call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in that presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings on Thursday, March 21, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance as a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. During our second fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 1.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 4.8%.\nThis morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 9.7% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.84. We opened 17 restaurants during the quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 27 restaurants in 16 states, 4 of which were reopenings.\nWe continue to stick to our strategy, driven by our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being brilliant with the basics enables our brands to consistently perform at a high level. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain strong across all of our brands. In fact, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze reached all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. LongHorn also ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in 6 of the 7 key measurement categories within Technomics industry tracking tool, including food, service, atmosphere and value.\nLongHorn's continued adherence to their strategy is driving strong execution which can also be seen in the fact that they established an all-time high [ stakes read ] correctly score. During the quarter, Olive Garden ran never any possible. It was offered at the same price point as last year, making it an even stronger value. Guest demand was higher this year, and our restaurant teams did a great job delivering outstanding guest experiences achieving the highest refill rate ever. This performance was driven by our focus on ensuring every guest is offered a refill, whether it's a limited time offer like never any possible or our never any first course, which is offered every day. This iconic promotion also satisfies all 3 of our marketing activity filters.\nIt elevates brand equity, it's simple to execute, and it's not at a deep discount. Also, I'm excited to share that during the second quarter and for the first time in their history, Olive Garden surpassed $5 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for all of our restaurant teams, and they embrace the opportunity to perform at their best. On Thanksgiving Day, our teams at Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, ADVs and Seasons 52 did just that with each setting a new daily sales record. And while we experienced some softness at our Fine Dining brands during the quarter, we are encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we are seeing.\nNow let me provide a brief update with [indiscernible]. Even in the midst of the integration, I'm really proud of how the entire team has remained focused on the guest experience. During the quarter, Ruth's Chris achieved the top box top overall rating score among all full-service signing brands within Technomics industry tracking tool. From an integration perspective, things are progressing well and we are on track to complete the major systems changes by the end of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we closed their former corporate office and the Ruth's Chris support team moved into our restaurant support center, we are excited to have them here.\nIn October, we successfully transitioned 21 restaurants to one of our distribution centers, and we plan to transition the remaining company-operated restaurants to our distribution system between January and March. This phased approach allows us to gather learnings and improve the transition for the other restaurants, while capturing supply chain synergies. We are deliberate with the timing of any changes to ensure that we minimize the operational impact as much as possible. We are on track to deploy our people management systems by the end of the calendar year, and beginning building out our proprietary point-of-sale system after Valentine's Day with the goal of completing all systems integration by the end of the fiscal year. As part of the investments we announced on our last call, we have made some strategic decisions at company-owned restaurants that will impact total sales in the third quarter.\nFirst, we stopped third-party delivery. Second, we eliminated lunch wherever possible and we will be closing most restaurants on Christmas Day. I can't say enough about the tremendous partnership between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team. Integration is never easy, but it has been a collaborative process and I am happy with the progress we are making. We have reached the halfway point in our fiscal year, and I'm pleased with our performance thus far. All of our brands remain focused on managing the business for the long term and the power of Darden positions us well for the future. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this for our team members and their families is through our next core scholarship program.\nApplications opened last month for the program, which awards post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children or dependents of Darden team. Last year, we awarded nearly 100 scholarships to children of team members at both our restaurant and our support center. The next core scholarship creates a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families and I'm excited that we are offering the program for a second year.\nFinally, as I said earlier, the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams. I'm so proud of the focus and commitment that all our teams continue to have every day. On behalf of our senior leadership team and Board of Directors, I want to thank our more than 190,000 team members for everything you do to delight our guests and help create special holiday memories. I wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season.\nNow I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Our teams did a great job managing their businesses again this quarter, resulting in meaningful restaurant level and total margin growth. This margin growth was driven by positive same-restaurant sales growth strong labor management and lower-than-anticipated restaurant and commodities expenses. We generated $2.7 billion of total sales for the second quarter, 9.7% higher than last year driven by the addition of 78 company-owned Ruth's Chris take house restaurant, 45 legacy Darden new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.8%.\nOur same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points, and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 370 basis points. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 in the second quarter, an increase of 21% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $403 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $340 million of capital to our shareholders through $158 million in dividends and $181 million of share repurchases.\nNow looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 190 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation was flat to prior year for the quarter and slightly better than our expectations. While beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing some favorability. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements at our brands as pricing and inflation were roughly equal at 5%. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points favorable primarily due to lower workers' compensation expense and deflation in utilities. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations.\nAll of these factors resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA of 18.8%, 230 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were $109 million, which was consistent with what we previously communicated. G&A as a percent of sales was unfavorable 40 basis points to last year. This unfavorability is primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expense due to the strong growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a low incentive accrual in the second quarter of last year. Impairments were 40 basis points unfavorable to last year as we are wrapping on a $9 million gain from the sale of restaurant assets. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year due to the financing expense expenses related to Ruth's Chris acquisition and the increase in short-term debt as the second quarter is typically our peak funding need period for the year.\nAnd for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 8.1% of sales, 60 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments. Olive Garden increased total sales by 6.3% driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 540 basis points. The strength of never-ending possible contributed to flat same-restaurant guest counts for the quarter, 480 basis points above the industry. This sales growth, along with improved labor productivity, higher pricing related to the inflation drove segment profit margin increase of 240 basis points at Olive Garden. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.1%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.9%, outperforming the industry by 620 basis points.\nSegment profit margin of 17.4% was 310 basis points above last year. Pricing leverage, favorable menu mix and improved labor productivity drove LongHorn strong margin growth this quarter. Total sales at Fine Dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both capital and EVs were negative, as the fine dining category as a whole continues to be challenged year-over-year. This resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The Other business segment sales increased slightly with the additional Ruth's Chris franchised and managed location revenue. This was mostly offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment.\nHowever, this was still 20 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 12.9% was 130 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and pricing related to inflation.\nNow turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. We've updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million; total inflation of 3% to 3.5%, including commodities inflation of approximately 2%. An annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5% and approximately 121 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in an increase to our adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8. 75 to $8. 90. It excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration-related costs.\nLooking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate to be consistent with what we previously shared, we expect third quarter growth rate to be similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter to have the lowest EPS growth rate for the year. This is primarily a function of the pricing cadence we communicated at the beginning of the year. We anticipate pricing and inflation to be relatively equal in the third quarter, and we expect to price significantly below inflation in the fourth quarter.\nSo to wrap up, we continue to be very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy, and we're confident in the strength of our business model. And with that, we'll take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis\n\nThank you, Daryl. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 2nd quarter earnings on Friday, December 15, before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nDuring today's call, any reference to pre-Covid when discussing first quarter performance as a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence, casual dining Ben Smart, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.\nDuring our first fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 4.2%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks, Kevin. We had a strong quarter as we continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. For the quarter, total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 11.6% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.78. We also opened 10 new restaurants in 9 different states during the quarter. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and adherence to our strategy. We continue to strengthen and leverage our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights rigorous strategic planning and a results-oriented culture, while our restaurant teams remain intensely focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere.\nThis focus on being growing with the basics continues to drive strong guest satisfaction. In fact, our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across all our brands. Additionally, several of our brands continue to rank #1 among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomics industry tracking tool, including LongHorn Steakhouse for food quality and taste and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value.\nOur team members bring our brands to life each day, and we know engaged team members are vital to creating great guest experiences. That's why our brands are focused on leveraging their unique cultures to strengthen team member engagement. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse created the Grill Masters Legends program that honors Grill Masters who have grilled more than 1 million stakes throughout their career which typically takes more than 20 years for a team member to accomplish. 5 Grill Masters Legends were honored during the quarter, bringing the total to 25 team members who have received this recognition.\nAlso during the quarter, Yard House completed its first best on tap competition. Known for having more than 130 beers on-tap, Yard House tested its bar tenders from every restaurant, giving them the opportunity to showcase their beverage knowledge, parting expertise and service skills. Congratulations to this year's winner, Alissa Hurley from the Yard House in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who was named Best on-tap. Programs like these give us an opportunity to celebrate team members who play a critical role in the guest experience and who serve as torchbearers for their brand culture.\nOne of the most significant ways our brands drive culture is through their annual leadership conferences, which provide the opportunity to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all our restaurants to discuss the plans for the year and generate excitement among our operators. I was pleased to see the high levels of engagement and strong alignment on what our restaurant teams must do to continue creating exceptional guest experiences across each of our iconic brands.\nTo further strengthen our brands, we are focused on highlighting what makes each one unique. That's why when it comes to marketing, any activity our brands undertake is evaluated through 3 filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations which allows our teams to consistently deliver memorable guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing so in a way that drives profitable sales growth.\nA great example of this activity was the Capital Growth Generous Poor event that took place during the quarter. This specially curated wine experience allows guests to sample award-winning wines that pair with items on the Capital Grille menu. And in the second quarter, Olive Garden is bringing back Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which brings to life its competitive advantage of Never Ending Abundant Craveable Italian food. Olive Garden's eClub members received a special invitation to begin enjoying NEPV this week. This guest favorite returns for everybody on Monday and will be offered at the same price point as last year.\nTurning to Ruth's Chris. Since the day we announced the completion of the acquisition, we have been guided by 3 key objectives. First, we want to preserve the team member experience and the brand's unique culture. Ruth's Chris has many long-tenured team members, and we are committed to ensuring this is a people-focused process. The team is engaged, and we have strong buying across the executive and operations leadership levels, all of which helps ensure a smooth transition.\nNext, we want to maintain and even strengthen the guest experience. Ruth's Chris is an incredibly strong brand, and it ranks as one of the top brands across multiple metrics within Technomics industry tracking tool. We now expect to realize more synergies than we originally anticipated, and we plan to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience. Raj will provide more details during his remarks.\nAnd last, we want to successfully migrate Ruth's Chris under the Darden platform. The team leading the integration is wrapping up the planning stage, and we're about to embark on the hardest part, the actual conversion to new systems and processes. We know that it's not easy, which is why we plan to complete it in phases over the next 9 months to limit disruptions as much as possible.\nLooking across our entire portfolio, I am pleased with the quarter. Our strategy is working, we continue to grow share, strengthen margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. And while I'm proud of our continued success, there is a larger purpose to what we do, and that is [indiscernible] delight everyone we serve. Not just within the 4 walls of our restaurants, but in the communities that our guests and team members call home.\nSeptember is hunger action month, and we are uniquely positioned to help fight hunger. This marks the 20th anniversary of our Harvest program. Since 2003, our restaurants have collected excess nutritious food that was not served to guests and prepared it for weekly donation to local nonprofit partners. Over the life of the program, we have donated the equivalent of more than 113 million meals. And for the past 13 years, we have partnered with Feeding America to help fight hunger. Over that time, the Garden Foundation has donated more than $16 million to support their network of more than 200 food banks.\nLast week, together with our partners, Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we added 10 more refrigerated trucks for mobile food pantry programs at 10 local food banks. To date, we have added a total of 35 trucks across Feeding America food banks in 18 states. Our ability to make a difference in the fight against hunger would not be possible without the efforts of our 190,000 team members and their passion to nourish and delight everyone we serve. I'm grateful for everything you do to help make our company successful.\nNow I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.7 billion, 11.6% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 77 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurants, same restaurant sales growth of 5% and 46 legacy Darden net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points, and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 430 basis points.\nFirst quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.78, an increase of 14.1% from last year's reported net earnings per share. We generated $388 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $300 million of capital to our shareholders with $159 million in dividends and $143 million of share repurchases. As we look at pricing and inflation during the quarter, we had total pricing of approximately 6% and which was 300 basis points above total inflation of roughly 3%.\nNow looking at our margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 130 basis points lower driven by pricing leverage. While beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing slight favorability. As a result, total commodities inflation of approximately 1% was better than our expectations. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements. We expected these productivity improvements to start materializing in the second quarter, but we began realizing them sooner.\nPricing and labor inflation were roughly equal at 6%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points favorable as leverage from higher sales more than offset elevated repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year consistent with our plan and including impacts from Ruth's Chris. All of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 19%, 170 basis points higher than last year.\nG&A expenses were 110 basis points above last year, driven by 3 primary factors: first, higher incentive compensation due to significant growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a very low incentive accrual in the first quarter of last year. Second, approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. And third, the addition of Ruth's Chris.\nImpairments were 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. We're wrapping on a $5 million gain from last year, and we incurred $3 million of impairments related to a handful of closings anticipated for this year. Interest expense increased 30 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings after tax was 7.9% of sales, flat to last year.\nNow turning to our segments. Sales increased at Olive Garden and LongHorn driven by same-restaurant sales and traffic growth. This sales growth, along with labor productivity and higher overall pricing related to inflation drove segment profit margin increases of 230 basis points at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Fine Dining segment total sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants, but same Russian sales were negative at both capital growth and AVs, consistent with what we indicated on our earnings call last quarter. This resulted in lower segment profit margin for fine dining than last year.\nAs we anticipated, the year-over-year same-restaurant sales decline in our Fine Dining segment was the result of ramping on a resurgence of demand in the first quarter last year that drove traffic retention to 107% of pre-Covid levels. Fine dining traffic retention in the first quarter of this year was 100% of pre-covid levels more in line with the retention levels for the prior 3 quarters.\nThe Other business segment increased sales driven by positive same-restaurant sales and the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed locations royalty revenue resulting in 140 basis points of segment profit margin growth. As a reminder, all of our franchise operating results are included in the other business segments.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on route synergies. As Rick mentioned, we've identified more synergies than we had initially expected and are choosing to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience at Ruth's Chris. Previously, we anticipated $20 million in annualized run rate synergies. We now expect approximately $35 million of gross run rate synergies and other cost savings, and we anticipate investing approximately $10 million into the business, resulting in annualized net run rate synergies of approximately $25 million. And for fiscal 2024, we now expect approximately $12 million of net synergies.\nFinally, as shared in the press release distributed this morning, we are reiterating our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our outlook still anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.55 to $8.85, including Ruth's operating results but excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration-related costs. And with that, we'll take your questions."

We had a solid quarter to conclude what was a very strong [indiscernible] despite an environment, we significantly outperformed the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and track and met or exceeded the financial outlook we provided at the outset of the year. For the full fiscal year, we grew sales by 8.9% to $10.5 billion, delivered diluted net earnings per share of $8 and opened 57 new restaurants.\nWe also opened 9 new national franchise restaurants in 6 different countries, which is the most we have ever opened in a fiscal year. The market responded positively to our performance, leading to a total shareholder return of 32.6% for the fiscal year. We have consistently delivered strong long-term shareholder returns. In fact, since Darden was spun off from General Mills 28 years ago, a period which spans multiple business cycles, the company has achieved an annualized TSR of 10% or greater over any 10 fiscal year period.\nOur restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. Our brand's ongoing efforts to drive execution through simplification, enable our restaurant teams to create guest experiences as evidence of a record level of performance we saw from many of our brands on key holidays throughout the year.\nNowhere is it more apparent than at Olive Garden, which achieved the highest sales day and sales week in their history during the week of Mother's Day. This focus on being brilliant with the basics leads to strong guest satisfaction scores, and our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across our brands.\nAt LongHorn Steakhouse, one of their most important metrics is their stakes will correctly score, which is at an all-time high. To continue to drive results, LongHorn recently completed their sixth Steak Master Series, which is their annual grilling competition and training program. Over the course of 2 months, thousands of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging training program for the right to be Crown Champion and received $15,000 gram price. Congratulations to this year's Steak Masters champion.\nKalyHall from the LongHorn Steakhouse in Ferrigett, Tennessee. I am particularly proud of everything the teams in our restaurants and at the support center accomplished in fiscal 2023. For example, Olive Garden successfully introduced Never earning possible, which leverage their iconic brand equity was much simpler to execute and significantly improve margin while still providing tremendous value for their guests. Throughout the year, several of our brands ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomics industry tracking tool, including LongHorn for food quality and Cheddar Scratch Kitchen for value.\nAnd several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in employment practices by Black Box Intelligence. Olive Garden, the Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award and LongHorn and EDVs received the Best Practices award.\nThroughout fiscal 2023, our strategy served us well. In addition to our back-to-basics operating philosophy driving strong execution in our restaurants, Darden's 4 competitive advantages of significant sale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and results-oriented culture, enabled our brands to compete more effectively and provide even greater value to their guests.\nOur significant scale allowed our teams to successfully manage through the highly unpredictable inflationary environment while continuing to underprice inflation over the long term. All 4 of our advantages are unmatched within the restaurant full service industry. These advantages are leveraged by our portfolio of iconic brands, all generating high average unit volumes with extensive geographic footprint. Our strategy is the right one for our company, and our advantages were further strengthened last week with the completion of the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.\nRuth's Chris enhances our scale advantage, our culture and complements our portfolio of iconic brands. We are so thrilled to have such an outstanding brand and high-caliber talent, and our experienced team is working hard to integrate Ruth Chris into Darden with as little disruption as possible. I'm proud of the results we achieved in fiscal 2023, and we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and long-term shareholder value.\nNow I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, 3.4% higher than last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4% and the addition of 47 net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 470 basis points, and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 540 basis points.\nDiluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15.2% from last year to $2.58. We generated $472 million in EBITDA and returned $183 million to shareholders.\nTotal inflation slowed meaningfully this quarter to 4.4%, 270 basis points less than the third quarter, while the rate of pricing decreased from last quarter to 5.9%.\nTurning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 30 basis points better, driven by pricing about commodities inflation of roughly 3%. Chicken and seafood experienced deflation this quarter, helping offset high single-digit beef and beat inflation.\nRestaurant labor was 40 basis points better, driven by productivity improvements. Expenses were 30 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage. Marketing expense was 1 point of sales, consistent with our expectations and 3 basis points higher than last year. All resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA being 80 basis points to 20.7%.\nOur general and administrative expenses was 40 basis points higher than last year driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual as well as unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we had this expense, this unfavorability is largely offset in our client.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.4%, and we generated $316 million in earnings from continuing operations, which was 11.4% of sales.\nLooking at our segments, Olive Garden, LongHorn or segment and same restaurant sales by 4.4%. -- going at our other segment significantly on the industry -- the strong same-restaurant sales performance drove segment profit margin at each of these segments higher than last year, especially at LongHorn, where segment profit margin of 18.6% was 70 basis points higher than last year.\nSame-restaurant sales at our Fine Dining segment decreased by 1.9%, still outperforming the Black Box Fine Dining benchmark, excluding Darden, by more than 200 basis points. This resulted in segment profit margin below last year at the Fine Dining segment. This year-over-year sales decline was more the result of a wrapping on resurgence of demand in the fourth quarter of last year, which drove traffic retention to 108% of pre-COVID levels.\nLooking at traffic retention trends over the past quarters, fine dining has been consistently between 101% to 102% of pre-COVID levels. We expect continued year-over-year traffic softness in our Fine Dining segment as we wrap on the first quarter traffic in fiscal 2023, that was at 107% of pre-COVID traffic levels. We expect traffic to stabilize on a year-over-year basis after the first quarter.\nAs we look at our annual results for fiscal 2023, we had strong same-restaurant sales of 6.8%, which outperformed the industry by 410 basis points, and our same-restaurant traffic was 510 basis points above the industry. Strong top line performance drove [ $160 ] billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and ended the year with $368 million of cash.\nLooking at our fiscal 2023 full year results compared to pre-COVID, operating income margins have grown 140 basis points. Food and beverage as a percent of sales increased 380 basis points driven by investments in food quality and pricing below commodities inflation. Offsetting this unfavorability were improvements in labor productivity, reduced restaurant and marketing expenses and G&A efficiencies. Our store operating margin generated significant and durable cash flows. Since 2018, we have delivered approximately 8% annualized EBITDA growth. At the end of fiscal 2023 our balance sheet was well positioned at just 1.8x adjusted debt to EBITDA, well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.\nAnd when we look at our performance compared to our long-term framework over the last 5 years, we've been able to achieve annualized total shareholder returns of 14.2% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is near the high end of our target and was driven by annualized earnings after-tax growth of 10.2% above the high end of our framework. Cash returns were 4%, which is at the middle of our framework. As we look to the future, we still believe that over time, our 10% to 15% target for total shareholder returns is appropriate. However, we're increasing the share repurchase range to better reflect the impact of our share price appreciation since we last updated the framework 5 years ago. The updated share repurchase range is $300 million to $500 million.\nBefore we get into our outlook for fiscal 2024, I want to provide an update on the acquisition of Ruth's Chris, which we completed last week. This was financed through a $600 million term loan and cash on our balance sheet bringing our adjusted debt to EBITDA to approximately 2x. As we move forward into 2024, sales and profits from Ruth Chris company owned and operated locations will be included in our Fine Dining segment, while revenues and profits from the franchise locations will reside in our other segment, consistent with the treatment of our existing franchise locations. However, Fine Dining same-restaurant sales results will not include Ruth Chris until they have been owned and operated by us for a period of 16 months.\nAs we mentioned in our conference call in early May, we expect to achieve synergies of approximately $20 million by the end of fiscal 2025, primarily through supply chain and G&A savings. We also expect Ruth Chris will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 in fiscal 2024 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2025. We anticipate total acquisition and integration-related expense of approximately $55 million pretax.\nNow turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024, which includes Ruth Chris operating results, but excludes the aforementioned acquisition and integration-related expense, we expect total sales of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, driven by the addition of Ruth Chris to our portfolio, same- restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and approximately 50 gross new restaurant openings, including 4 relocations. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million. Total inflation of approximately 3% to 4%, which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% driven primarily by beef and produce, while most other categories are flat to deflationary. And hourly labor inflation in the mid-single digits. An annual tax effective tax rate of approximately 12% to 12.5% and approximately 121.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $8.55 and $8.85. And finally, our Board reported an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.31 per share, implying an annual dividend of $0.24.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. During the year, we served more than 410 million guests. We also promoted nearly 1,300 hourly team members into our manager and training program and promoted 320 managers to General Manager or managing partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members' development with new programs like Fast Fluency, which allows them to learn English for free, and our next course scholarship program that awarded post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members.\nWe also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Darden Harvest Food Donation program, our restaurants donated 4.4 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2023. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that help provide mobile food truck to 10 different Feeding America food banks, bringing the total 25 food banks across the country.\nThe addition of Ruth Chris gives us the opportunity to nourish and delight even more guests, more team members and more communities. As I said earlier, they are an excellent addition to our portfolio. And I want to welcome Cheryl Henry and the nearly 5,000 team members from Ruth Chris. We are excited that you are now officially part of the Darden family.\nI also want to thank our team members and our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. We are fortunate to have people in the industry, and I am proud of their commitment to caring for our guests and each other. Now we'll take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Analysis, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.\nThose risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 22, before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nDuring today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.\nDuring our third fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 7.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward, and Raj will provide more details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2023 financial outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. We significantly exceeded the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic outperforming more on traffic than we did on sales. We also continue to underprice inflation, resulting in lower overall check growth relative to the industry. Our ability to make this investment and provide strong value to our guests, reinforces the power of our strategy, which comes to life through our 4 competitive advantages and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy.\nI am particularly proud of the way our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by being brilliant with the basics. This intense focus on providing great food service and atmosphere enables them to consistently create memorable guest experiences. During the holiday season, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse set new all-time weekly sales records, only to break them during Valentine's week. In fact, all of our brands achieved record total sales for the quarter. Of course, none of this would be possible without having the right people in the right roles ready to serve our guests.\nOur restaurants continue to be well staffed and our manager staffing remains at historic highs. Our leaders work hard to ensure each of our restaurants is a great place to work. During the quarter, several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders by Black Box Intelligence. Longhorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award, which evaluates the brand's employee retention as well as sales and traffic performance. Olive Garden, the Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award, which is based on workforce data, including employee turnover and gender and racial diversity.\nWe know from our recent engagement survey results that our overall level of engagement is very high, and our team members understand what is expected of them at work. This is helping drive high guest satisfaction metrics, both internally and externally. Data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index shows customer satisfaction is down across all industries. However, across all of our brands, our internal guest satisfaction ratings remain exceptionally strong. In fact, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House and Bahama Breeze achieved all-time highs during the quarter. Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter, the Darden brand was ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in each measurement category within Technomic industry tracking tool.\nEven with the traffic growth we achieved during the quarter, to-go sales remained strong, accounting for 26% of total sales at Olive Garden 14% at LongHorn and 12% at Cheddar's. We continue to leverage technology to make it easier to order a pick up and pay without having to pass the added expense of third-party delivery on to our guests. Our teams are executing the off-premise experience at a high level. For example, to-go orders accounted for 33% of Olive Garden's total sales on Valentine's Day, and they significantly improved their ratings for both on time and order accuracy for that day.\nFor the quarter, digital transactions accounted for more than 62% of all off-premise sales and 10% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter across 7 states. Our new restaurant opening teams continue to do an excellent job of hiring and training new team members and successfully opening these locations. We are on track to open 25 net new restaurants during the fourth quarter and I am confident in our ability to do so because of our well-prepared leadership pipeline and the tremendous support teams we have in place. We are fortunate to have the best team members in the industry, and I am proud of the focus and commitment they continue to display.\nOn behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank all of our team members for everything you do to nourish and delight our guests and each other. Now I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had high expectations for the third quarter sales growth as we were wrapping on last January, Omicron outbreak and several weeks of severe winter weather that combined to reduce sales by over $100 million in the third quarter of last year. We exceeded those high expectations, posting record total sales of $2.8 billion, which was 13.8% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants.\nThis same restaurant sales performance outpaced the industry by 450 basis points, and our same-restaurant guest counts performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 700 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, an increase of 21.2% above last year. Total EBITDA was $448 million, and we returned $272 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $148 million in dividends and $124 million in share repurchases.\nTotal pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.3%, 70 basis points below total inflation of roughly 7%. Now looking at our margin performance compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses rose 110 basis points, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 9%, which was higher than we anticipated going into the quarter and significantly outpaced pricing of 6.3%. Chicken, dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation, but each improved versus prior quarter as we expected. However, beef inflation increased from the second quarter level and drove the majority of our higher-than-anticipated commodities inflation this quarter.\nRestaurant labor was 120 basis points better than last year as we benefited from sales leverage and our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7%. Restaurant expenses were 40 basis points favorable to last year as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expenses.\nMarketing expenses were 10 basis points lower than last year, driven by sales leverage. G&A expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual and other expenses. Operating income margin of 12.6% was 30 basis points better than last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $287 million.\nNow looking at our margin performance versus pre-COVID, we grew operating income by 70 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 400 basis points since pre-COVID. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing and other cost savings initiatives.\nLooking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden grew 13.9% above last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 12.3%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 108% of pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 22.5% was 150 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. LongHorn sales grew 13.5% above last year, with same-restaurant sales growth of 10.8%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 127% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 80 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation.\nSales in our Fine Dining segment grew 13.2% above last year driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 113% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 21.8% and was 110 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Our other segment sales grew 14.1% above last year with the same restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID level.\nSegment profit margin of 14% was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have increased our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $10.45 billion to $10.5 billion, same restaurant sales growth of 6.5% to 7%, approximately 55 new restaurant openings, capital spending between $550 million to $575 million; total inflation of 7% to 7.5% and annual pricing of 6% to 6.5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 9.5% and 10%. The annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.85 and $8.\nThis outlook implies fourth quarter sales between $2.73 billion and $2.78 billion, same restaurant sales between 3% and 5%, and diluted net earnings per share between $2.43 and $2.58. It also implies higher commodities inflation than we last communicated. We now expect commodities inflation that is solidly in the low single-digit range for the fourth quarter versus the closer to flat estimate we shared with you on the last earnings call.\nThe increasing commodities inflation is primarily due to higher-than-anticipated beef costs. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening 50 to 55 new restaurants and capital spending between $300 million and $325 million related to new restaurants and another $200 million to $225 million related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh and technology spending.\nAnd while we don't normally provide a commodity outlook this early for the next fiscal year, we are anticipating low single-digit inflation for the total commodities basket in fiscal 2024 led by high single-digit inflation on beef and produce. We expect all other categories to range from slight deflation to low single-digit inflation.\nWith that, I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. Now we'll open it up for questions."

Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning and happy holidays, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. All of our brands performed at a high level by remaining focused on our Back-to-Basics Operating Philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. At the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Being brilliant with the basics starts with achieving and maintaining appropriate staffing levels in our restaurants. Across our brands, our teams are doing a great job of ensuring we are ready to run 14 great shifts a week.\nAt each of our brands, we are fully staffed at the team member level, and manager staffing is at historic highs. As a result, our teams are executing more consistently, which in turn is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands, according to both internal and external sources.\nDuring the quarter, 4 of our brands achieved all-time high internal guest satisfaction ratings and the others remain near all-time highs. Also, with Technomic industry tracking tool, a Darden brand was ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in each measurement category. I am particularly proud of Olive Garden's performance.\nDuring the quarter, they brought back their most popular limited time offers, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. As you may recall, when I talked last to you, I shared that any promotional activity or brands introduced should be evaluated with the following 3 filters.\nFirst, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And third, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth.\nThree years after it was last offered, the 2022 version of Never Ending Pasta Bowl checked all 3 of these boxes. First, it leveraged Olive Garden's iconic brand equity by perfectly reinforcing their competitive advantage of Never Ending abundant craveable Italian food. Next, it was amplified by only offering existing menu items with limited add-on choices, which made it easier to execute, resulting in great guest experiences.\nFinally, it was priced $3 higher than in 2019, which significantly improved the margin of this offer while still providing tremendous value for our guests. Never Ending Pasta Bowl exceeded expectations, and we saw a step change in Olive Garden's positive gap to industry traffic during the 7 weeks at ramp. I'm even more encouraged by this performance, given that it was supported with about 3/4 of the media in past years.\nGoing forward, the team will build on their learnings and share insights across our brands, but this may be the only limited time offer we do at Olive Garden this fiscal year.\nAcross our brands, we continue to drive strong execution of the off-premise guest experience through ongoing investments in technology that reduce friction for our guests and our operators. For example, many of our guests still prefer to call in their To Go order.\nHowever, taking payment over the phone or when the guests arrived is both inefficient for our teams and inconvenient for our guests. To help address this, we rolled out online payment for call-in orders during the quarter, enhancing convenience for our guests and making our To Go specialists more efficient. To Go sales remain sticky across our core casual dining brand, accounting for 25% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at Longhorn and 13% at Cheddar's.\nDigital transactions accounted for 62% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, and they have enjoyed welcoming even more guests back into their restaurants this season. In fact, the Capital Grille, Eddie V's and Seasons 52, enjoyed all-time daily sales record on Thanksgiving Day, and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging.\nThe holidays are also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business. And we embraced a higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is through our harvest program.\nOne in 8 households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, our restaurants donate fresh, unused food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis throughout the year. Since the inception of this program, more than 131 million pounds of food have been donated, which is the equivalent of more than 100 million meals.\nThe impact of our harvest program takes on added significance during the holidays. And I am delighted that our teams are helping to make a difference in some of the communities across the country. I'm so proud of the focus and commitment our teams continue to display. Their disciplined approach in executing on our strategy is what enables us to succeed regardless of the operating environment. This is evidenced by the fact that just last week, we surpassed $10 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis for the first time in Darden's history.\nOn behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and our communities. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season. Now I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, 9.4% higher than last year, driven by 7.3% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same-restaurant sales performance outperformed -- outpaced the industry by 370 basis points and our same-restaurant guest counts are performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 550 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, an increase of 2.7% above last year.\nTotal EBITDA was $330 million, and we returned $249 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $149 million in dividends and $100 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.5%, 200 basis points below total inflation of roughly 8.5%.\nNow looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 240 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 15%, which significantly outpaced our pricing. As we expected, chicken, dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation. Produce especially let us -- was much higher than expected due to poor growing conditions and weather-related events in the quarter. However, our scale and vendor partnerships help to minimize this impact relative to the general market.\nRestaurant labor was 30 basis points better than last year, even with total restaurant labor inflation of 7%. Our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8.5%. Restaurant expenses were 20 basis points favorable as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense.\nMarketing expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year as we increased media support for the reintroduction of Never Ending Pasta Bowl. This was in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. G&A expenses were 40 basis points below last year, driven by sales leverage and a lower incentive accrual, which was in line with our plan. This favorability was partially offset by higher mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation.\nAnd as a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Page 13 of our presentation illustrates the roughly 20 basis point reduction to operating income -- income from mark-to-market expense and the 150 basis point benefit to the tax rate. The effective tax rate of 12.1% this quarter would have been 13.6% without the impact from the hedge.\nNow looking at our margin performance versus pre-COVID, we grew operating income margin by 160 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 500 basis points. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing and other cost savings initiatives.\nLooking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden were 9.2% above last year driven by same-restaurant sales of 7.6%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 112% of the pre-COVID level. LongHorn sales were 9.7% above last year with same-restaurant sales growth of 7.3%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 125% of the pre-COVID level.\nSales in our Fine Dining segment were 7% above last year, driven by same-restaurant sales of 5.9% and average sales -- weekly sales were 117% of the pre-COVID level. Our other segment sales were 10.5% above last year, with same-restaurant sales of 7.1% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID level.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales of $10.3 billion to $10.45 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, 55 to 60 new restaurants, capital spending of $525 million to $575 million, total inflation of approximately 7%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 6%.\nFurthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 8% and 9%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.60 and $8.\nLooking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate year-over-year to be fairly balanced. In the third quarter, we estimate the outsized sales growth from lapping Omicron last year to be partially offset by underpricing inflation by approximately 50 basis points.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect inflation to further moderate on our pricing gap drivers contributing to margin growth. Now to wrap up, let me say that we're very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and providing value to our guests in the face of strong inflation. We're confident in the underlying strength of our business model and our team's ability to continue managing through this unpredictable environment effectively.\nNow we will open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Analysis, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\nAs a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation.\nLooking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 2nd quarter earnings on Friday, December 16, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing first quarter performance is a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThis morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now I will turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had a solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging inflationary and uncertain macroeconomic environment. This was also the first quarter where we began to see the industry return to normal seasonal patterns.\nI'm proud of the way our restaurant teams are performing. Our brands remain focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture.\nOur people bring our brands to life every day, and our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level, even with a lot of new team members as our staffing has returned to normal levels. Our team's ability to be brilliant with the basics is driving strong guest satisfaction across all our brands. These satisfaction measures at Olive Garden are at or near all-time highs, and steaks grilled correctly scores at LongHorn Steakhouse are the highest in their history.\nWe remain focused on creating great learning environments for new team members to ensure they are fully trained and execute to our standards. Further, our ongoing investments in our team members helps reinforce our strong employment proposition. This focus takes on added significance as we open value-creating new restaurants, which further strengthens our scale advantage.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully staffed and opened 9 new restaurants and we remain on track to open 55 to 60 new restaurants this fiscal year. We also continue to invest in our digital platform and To Go sales benefited from these investments during the quarter. To Go sales accounted for 24% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn Steakhouse and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.\nDigital transactions accounted for 32% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. Our technology investments have created an infrastructure that reduces friction for our guests and our operators, and we will continue to invest in technology that benefits both off-premise and in-restaurant dining occasions.\nWe are also leveraging our scale to help mitigate the impact of heightened inflation. During the quarter, we continued to experience significant commodities cost pressure, and our supply chain team did an excellent job of working with the suppliers to minimize or offset cost increases to the extent possible.\nInflation remains a headwind for consumers as well, particularly those in households making less than $50,000 a year. Olive Garden and Cheddar's have more direct exposure to these guests. Looking at guest behavior across our entire portfolio, we are seeing softness with these consumers, while conversely, we are seeing strength with guests in higher-income households. Even in this environment, our brands remain committed to our strategy to price below their competitors.\nSince we emerged from the high of the pandemic, you have heard us talk about the search for equilibrium or more normal business trends. During the quarter, we saw a return to historical seasonal patterns, which we did not experience last year. As we have discussed in recent calls, finding that equilibrium will inform our brand's marketing strategies.\nAs we execute our plans, we will be very selective in bringing any promotional activity back. And any promotional activity we introduced should be evaluated with the following filters.\nFirst, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth.\nAs an example, Olive Garden's unique competitive advantage is Never Ending abundant craveable Italian food. That is why their television advertising progressed from spots that feature their never-ending first course to those that are now focused on their made-from-scratch sauces and anything they do going forward should continue to elevate this core brand equity.\nI am pleased with the progress our teams made executing against their strategic priorities during the quarter. Our strategy is working, enabling us to grow sales, increase market share and invest in our people and our brands, all while continuing to earn -- to return capital to our shareholders.\nLast month, we held our annual leadership conferences, which provide a powerful way for us to engage with every general manager and managing partner across all 1,875 restaurants. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and the opportunity to interact with them and listen to those closest to the action is invaluable.\nOur leaders returned to their restaurants aligned to their brand's operational priorities and motivated to continue winning. In order to win, we must stay focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy and leveraging our 4 competitive advantages as we continue working in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Our guests, our team members and the communities where we operate.\nOne of the ways we serve our communities is by fighting hunger. Once again this year, Darden is helping Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 10 member food banks to support mobile pantry programs and food distribution in communities with the highest need. With the addition of these new trucks, 25 different food banks have received the trucks since January of last year.\nOf course, our philanthropic giving would not be possible without the passion our restaurant teams have for nourishing and delighting our guests. On behalf of our leadership team and our Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and communities. Now I will turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had strong absolute results in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the efforts of our restaurant and support center teams to drive sales, effectively manage spending and navigate a challenging environment.\nWe're lapping record first quarter performance from last year, which was driven by a resurgence in demand, more efficient labor with staffing levels below our standards and many other costs that had yet to be reintroduced into the business as we recovered from the impacts of the pandemic.\nTotal sales for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, 6.1% higher than last year and driven by 4.2% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56. Total EBITDA was $340 million, and we paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $199 million in shares, returning a total of $349 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter.\nIn the first quarter, total inflation was roughly 9.5% and total pricing was approximately 6.5%, almost 300 basis points below inflation. We expect total inflation and our gap between pricing and inflation to have peaked in the first quarter.\nWe also expect inflation to moderate throughout the remainder of the year while our pricing gap should narrow in both the fast -- I'm sorry, both the second and third quarter and then reverts in the fourth quarter.\nAnd while we have commodities inflation risk in the back half of the year, we have pricing plans ready to put into action, which will help preserve our targeted gap to inflation for the year if we see inflation higher than our expectations.\nConsistent with what we expected and communicated in the June call, the significant level of pricing below inflation pressured all aspects of our P&L in the first quarter and drove margins well below last year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect margins to decline less than they did in the first quarter and then grow versus last year in the back half.\nNow looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 280 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of 15%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points above last year, driven by hourly wage inflation of just over 9% and wrapping on last year's elevated productivity. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7.5%.\nRestaurant expenses were 10 basis points above last year driven by higher repairs and maintenance expense due to supply chain challenges and utilities inflation of 16%. Marketing spend was 20 basis points higher as we increased testing of both digital and television marketing.\nG&A expense was 130 basis points below last year, driven primarily by 2 factors. First, mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation plans was lower by about $7 million and as a reminder, this -- due to the way we hedged this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line.\nSecond, equity compensation expense related to retirement-eligible individuals and our incentive accrual, while both in line with our plan were significantly less than last year. Operating income margin of 10% was 220 basis points below last year, but 60 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $194 million.\nNow looking at our segments. All of our segments outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. And as Rick mentioned, we began seeing a return-to-normal seasonal sales patterns. This was evident in our monthly same-restaurant sales compared to last year when we did not experience typical seasonal softness. Same-restaurant sales for June were in the mid-3% range. July was in the low-1% range, and they were approximately 8% in August.\nSales at Olive Garden were 3.7% above last year, and average weekly sales were 101% of the pre-COVID levels despite the significant reduction in promotional activity and couponing versus that time period. As we talked about in the past, we believe the pre-COVID marketing and promotional activities historically drove double-digit traffic.\nAnd when we look at our average weekly traffic at Olive Garden, we're retaining over 90% of pre-COVID, indicating that traffic trends are flat to above pre-COVID levels when considering historical marketing activities.\nLongHorn sales were 6.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 126% of the pre-COVID levels. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 8.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 120% of the pre-COVID levels. Our Other Segment sales were 9.9% above last year, and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID levels.\nDespite all of our segments having higher sales above last year, the high levels of inflation and wrapping on last year's inflated earnings when many costs had not fully returned to the business, pressured segment profit margin below last year for all the segments.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We reiterated all aspects of our guidance in this morning's press release, culminating in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8 for the year.\nFinally, looking at the second quarter, we've seen continued strength in our sales trends with quarter-to-date sales above the high end of our annual same-restaurant sales outlook range. We also expect commodities inflation close to 13% and pressuring the second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly below last year.\nIn what continues to be an unpredictable year, we're confident with the underlying strength of our business model and in our team's ability to effectively manage through it. And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Please go ahead. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Analysis, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maureen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\nAs a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from -- materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation.\nAny reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This is because the results from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during those periods. This will be the final quarter that we provide comparisons to pre-COVID. Moving forward, we'll provide comparisons to the prior year.\nWe plan to release fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 22, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and full year before discussing our focus moving forward. Raj will provide details on our Q4 and full year financial results and share our fiscal 2023 financial outlook, and then Rick will close with some final comments.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is our first conference call since Gene's retirement, so I want to take a moment to thank him. Gene never wanted the spotlight on himself, and he's probably listening right now and telling me to move on. But Darden is stronger today and better positioned to navigate any operating environment because of Gene's leadership. And personally, I know I'm better prepared for my role, thanks to Gene's mentorship. So on behalf of our 180,000 team members, thank you, Gene, for putting our guests and team members first and for leading Darden with a steady and decisive hand.\nAs you saw from our press release this morning, we had a very good quarter, even in this highly inflationary environment. For the quarter, we exceeded our sales expectations and our earnings were in line with our outlook. Overall, fiscal 2022 was a solid year. Each of our brand strengthened their business models, while our restaurant teams remain disciplined and executed well in a challenging environment. We stuck to our strategy, continue to price below inflation and ended the year with significantly better margins than pre-COVID. As a result of this business model improvement and our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned as we begin our new fiscal year, in what remains an uncertain environment.\nRaj will share details for the quarter and the full year in a moment. But first, I want to spend my time reiterating Darden's strategy, which is not changing and will remain our focus moving forward. Our brands benefit from Darden's 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture, but none is more evident in our financial results than our scale.\nTo quickly dimensionalize our scale advantage for you, our total sales are more than 2x our closest full-service restaurant competitor and more than 2.5x the next closest. We also have higher-than-average annual restaurant volumes; lower overhead costs, which we achieved by centralizing our support functions; and margins that are significantly higher than our competitive set.\nOur scale creates cost advantages that our brands could not achieve individually. A great example is the fact that each of our specialty restaurant brands: the Capital Grille, Eddie V's, Seasons 52, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, achieved record results for the year, even in the midst of historic inflation.\nWe will continue to leverage our scale and our superior financial position to make long-term investments in our business. First, we will continue to invest in our brands' value propositions by underpricing inflation over the long term. This is the biggest investment we make every year. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our scale to invest in technology that enhances the guest experience and simplifies operations.\nFinally, it is our people who bring our brands to life, and we will continue to invest in them so they can grow and thrive and help us do the same.\nAt the restaurant level, our strategy comes to life through our back-to-basics operating philosophy. This philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, has never been more important than it is today. Our restaurant team is focused on being brilliant with the basics, ensures we put the full in full-service dining.\nThe work our brands are doing to drive execution by simplifying our processes and menus puts our restaurant teams in the best position to deliver great guest experiences, and it's working. Olive Garden's overall guest satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. Additionally, on Mother's Day, the Olive Garden team delivered record performance. Mother's Day was the highest sales day and second highest guest count day in their history. We also continue to make key investments across our portfolio to position each brand for long-term success.\nFor example, LongHorn Steakhouse has made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food. They continue to lead the casual dining industry on food quality and taste of food, which propelled them to over $2 billion in annual sales for the first time.\nSimilarly, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen is a value leader, and the investments they have made to simplify their menu and price below inflation has resulted in improvement in their industry-leading value ratings.\nFinally, as I mentioned, our specialty brands had record performance for the year, which was due to the investments they made during COVID and the scale advantage of Darden. Our strategy remains the right one for the company, and we will continue to execute it to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. As we begin our new fiscal year, we continue to experience significant inflationary pressures, and we will stick to our strategy of pricing below inflation and our competitors over time. While we can't predict the future, we're focused on managing the business for the long term, and the power of Darden positions us to navigate this environment better than anyone else.\nNow I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, 14.2% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants, which included 1 temporary closure that will reopen in fiscal 2023. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.24.\nTotal EBITDA was $431 million, and we returned significant cash to shareholders, paying $137 million in dividends and repurchasing $237 million in shares for a total of $374 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. We continue to see increasing cost pressures with total inflation for the fourth quarter of 7.5%. During the quarter, we took additional pricing to help offset a portion of the growing inflation that brought total pricing to 6% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This is well below our annual inflation of just over 6%, as we continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our value leadership position.\nTurning to the fourth quarter P&L. Compared to pre-COVID, food and beverage expenses were 300 basis points higher, driven by investments in both pricing below inflation and in food quality. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 12% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points lower, driven by hourly labor efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, which were partially offset by continued wage pressures. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7% versus last year, primarily driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 9%.\nMarketing spend was $48 million lower as we remain disciplined in our approach to marketing activities, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 140 basis points lower, driven by our corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021 and sales leverage. As a result, we achieved restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 19.9%, 40 basis points above pre-COVID level, and quarterly EBITDA of $431 million. Total EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.6%, a 170 basis point improvement to pre-COVID.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. We ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $282 million, which was 10.8% of sales. All of our segments had higher total sales and higher average weekly sales per restaurant. Segment profit dollars were higher for all segments as well.\nOlive Garden and Fine Dining segments also grew their segment profit margin, while LongHorn and other business segment had lower segment profit margin this quarter, driven by higher level of inflation and other investments in those businesses since pre-COVID.\nFiscal 2022 proved to be another unpredictable year. We experienced strong demand early in the year as capacity restrictions were largely removed. Additionally, we faced reduced demand and staffing challenges as the Delta variant emerged in the fall and the Omicron variant followed in December and January. Finally, inflation increased throughout the year. In fact, our total inflation doubled from our original expectation of 3% to just over 6% for the full year.\nDespite all of those challenges, we were able to deliver $9.6 billion in total sales and achieved diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.40, in line with our internal expectations and at the higher end of our -- the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. We see a strong top and bottom line performance drove over $1.5 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations, resulting in 15.9% EBITDA margin, nearly 200 basis points higher than pre-COVID.\nWe also invested almost $400 million of capital in the business, returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders and ended the year with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet.\nOur strong operating model generates significant cash flows. In fact, since 2017, we have averaged EBITDA growth of 9.5% annually. Our balance sheet is well situated at just 1.8x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2022, well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x, and provides us flexibility for the future. The strong balance sheet, coupled with our disciplined approach to simplifying operations, underpricing inflation and driving profitable sales growth, positions us well for the future.\nFinally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We expect total sales of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8% from last year; same restaurant sales growth of 4% to 6% and 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $500 million to $550 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 5%.\nFurthermore, we expect commodities inflation of approximately 7% that's heavily weighted in the first half of the year; hourly labor inflation of approximately 8%; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8.\nHeading into 2023, we expect the commodities inflation rate to increase in the first quarter from the 12% we had in Q4 and then to moderate significantly, ending the year roughly flat. So due to this significant unusual timing, we would like to provide some context on the cadence of quarterly earnings expectations.\nWith the first quarter commodities inflation in the mid-teens, we expect a low double-digit percentage decline in EPS from last year. For the second quarter, commodities inflation eases a bit to the low double-digit range, resulting in flat EPS to last year. And for the back half of the year, we anticipate low single-digit commodity inflation and positive EPS growth. As a result of our strong performance and our fiscal 2023 outlook, our Board approved a 10% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.21 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.84. This results in a yield of 4.2% based on yesterday's closing share price.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nCEO, President & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Raj. I want to close by thanking our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout a challenging year. As a publicly traded company, we strive to earn a profit and create long-term shareholder value. And while we are proud that our average annual total shareholder return has always been at least 10% for any 10-year period as a public company, there is a larger purpose to what we do, and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve.\nAs a restaurant company, we continue to nourish our guests with delicious, high-quality food. But to us, it means more than that. We want to nourish the spirits of our guests, to delight them with great service in an atmosphere that enables them to reenergize and connect with family and friends over a great meal. We also want to nourish and delight our team members by providing competitive wages and benefits while giving them opportunities to build meaningful careers within our company.\nWith more than 1,850 locations and 8,000 leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway for thousands of people across the country to transform an entry-level job into a lifelong career. Helping others realize their potential and achieve their dreams is one of the things that makes our industry special, and that's why a central tenet of our approach to team member development is a commitment to promote from within.\nWe are proud that more than half of our restaurant manager positions are filled by our hourly team members. But their growth doesn't stop at the restaurant manager level. In fact, more than 15% of our officers began their careers with us as hourly team members.\nFinally, we want to nourish and delight the communities where we operate and our team members call home. When we open a new restaurant, we make a positive impact by creating an average of 100 new jobs and serving the local community. We aim to make a difference by helping tackle issues that we are best equipped to address, like fighting hunger and sourcing food with care.\nSo our purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve, is not limited to just sales and earnings growth, rather, it's about sales and earnings growth as a way to make a positive difference in the lives of millions more guests, tens of thousands more team members and hundreds more communities. And by doing so, we'll continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.\nNow let's take your questions."

    "content": "Q1 2022 1&1 AG Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2022 1&1 AG Earnings Call\n\nDRIXETRAMAY 12, 4:00 AM\n\nOliver Keil\n\nHead of IR, 1&1 Drillisch AG\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2022 conference call. During this conference call, our CFO, Markus Huhn, will first go through the highlights of the first quarter '22 and then walk through our financial numbers and presenting the latest update for the build and the rollout of our 1&1 mobile network. After that, as always, we have time for the Q&A.\nWith that, I hand over to Markus. Markus?\n\nMarkus Huhn\n\nCFO & Member of Management Board, 1&1 Drillisch AG\n\nThank you, Oliver. Yes, good morning. This is Markus speaking. Yes, a warm welcome to all participants in the call from my side as well. I would like to give you an overview to the performance of Q1 and the financial results. Please let us step into the presentation with Slide #4, the customer base. We have increased our customer base with 60,000 new contracts in the first quarter, plus 90,000 mobile contracts and a decrease of minus 30,000 broadband lines. These numbers are reflecting that what we have already mentioned during our last call in March this year, the growth in Q1 is encumbered by minus 90,000 contract leavings because of the latest amendment of the Telecommunication Act.\nSo our operational performance without this negative impact is plus 150,000 contracts, which is above the Q1 performance in 2021. As we have already explained in the last call, we see this impact as a temporary impact in this year because of the shorter cancellation period of 1 month. To understand this issue, you have to differentiate between the moment when the customer cancels his contract and the moment when the contract will finish.\nBefore the last amendment of the Telecommunication Act, there was a minimum of 3-month difference between the moment of cancellation and the moment of finishing the contract. After the last amendment, in many cases, there is just a difference of 1 month instead of a couple of months, which leads temporary to a higher number of leavings. So the conclusion is the number of cancellations is still on the same and a low level. But we have temporarily a higher number of leavings because we have to close the contract earlier than before.\nYes. Let us go to revenue on Slide #5. You can see revenue in first quarter 2022, with EUR 975.9 million, which is more or less the same as in the year before. Service revenue was EUR 789.1 million and a plus of 3.5% is still on a solid growth path. The other revenue, mainly hardware revenue is below 2021 with minus 11.7%. This is caused by a lower number of transactions and a lower demand out of our customer base for new smartphones. Furthermore, we have a shift between the first and the second quarter in later delivering -- the deliveries of smartphones to our customers.\nLet us go to the EBITDA by segment on Slide #6. In the Access segment, we have realized EUR 195.4 million in the first quarter, which is a solid increase of 11.6% compared with the year before. The year before, in the EUR 175.1 million. This amount doesn't include the EUR 34.4 million non-period income in 2021 as also mentioned on the Slide #8. The minus EUR 8.3 million EBITDA in segment 1&1 mobile network is including our activities for the start of the rollout of the network.\nNow, I would like to go on the status of the one-on-one mobile network. Slide #8. Yes. On the Slide #8, you see the issues that we -- that have already been realized since 2019. Whilst the negotiations and the agreement for national roaming took 2.5 years, we were -- we could start with the negotiations of the contract that we need to build up the network in 2021. So that means we had 1 year to prepare all the -- yes, the necessary agreements that we need after we had finished the national roaming agreement in May last year.\nSo most of the topics and issues have already been mentioned in our last calls. There are 2 new topics since our last call. One is the new contract with GfTD and the contract with American Tower Cooperation for co-location. Both contracts have been signed in April this year.\nOn the next slide. After we have all partners on the start that we need, our target is to be able to start with the operational -- or to operate with the 5G net within 1 year. And therefore, we have planned some milestones that you see on this slide. So in Q3 2022, the -- we will realize the connections to Internet nodes, approximately 40 public and private peeries. And we will start a friendly user test in the Frankfurt Main area.\nThen in Q4 2022, we start with the operations of approximately 140 regional edge data centers with 24 decent realized edge data centers and with 2 core data centers. And of course, at the end of Q4, we have to finish the first 1,000 antenna sites. We will also launch our first product, which is a fixed wireless access product. Then in Q1 2023, we will build up the connection to national and international telecommunication networks. End of Q2 2023, we are able to start with national roaming. And then in Q3 2023, we will start with the operational of the 5G network with all of the 4 core data centers. We will have the full functionality of national roaming. And then we will also start with the marketing launch and parallel to that, the [succession] of the MVNO sales.\nSo these are the main -- or the most important milestones in the next 12 years -- 12 months, sorry. On the right-hand side on the slide, you see the obligations that we have to fulfill, the first 1,000 sites per end of this year. And the 50% household coverage end of 2030, but our plan is to have this household coverage much sooner than we need for the obligations.\nNow we come to the key financial figures for the first quarter. I would like to start with the P&L, Slide #11. Revenue has already been commented. The cost of sales grew up from EUR 651.5 million in 2021 to EUR 659.5 million. Press profit dropped from EUR 322.2 million to EUR 316.4 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we had already mentioned positive non-period impact of EUR 34.4 million, which is included in the cost of sales. Without this impact, the operational gross profit in 2021 was EUR 287.8 million, which leads to an operational increase in the position gross profit in Q1 2022 of plus 9.9%.\nThen the costs for distribution increased from EUR 114.3 million in 2021 to EUR 120.7 million, which is driven by higher spendings in marketing. The administration costs was EUR 30.8 million, more or less on the same level as in the year before. The other operating income and expenses with EUR 5.6 million are also in the range of that what we've seen in the year before. We have an increase in the impairments on renewables and contract assets from EUR 17.9 million in 2021 to EUR 23.7 million in Q1 2022.\nThe profit from operating activities in the first quarter is EUR 146.8 million. In the EUR 162.6 million in the year before, of course, is also the non-period impact included. If we eliminate this impact, we would come to increase, an operational profit increase of approximately 14.8%. Financial result with minus EUR 1.6 million is including the spendings for the investment in white spots. To remember, in the auction 2019, we have agreed with the government to pay the frequencies over 12 years in installments. And we gave the commitment to invest EUR 50 million in white spots. So this investment is reflected in the position financial result.\nYes. Then we come to a profit before taxes of EUR 145.2 million. Tax expenses with minus EUR 43.6 million and the consolidated result of EUR 11.6 million for the first quarter 2022. On the next slide, you see the balance sheet. The balance sheet in total rose from EUR 7,630.7 million at end of 2021 to EUR 7,090.4 million as of end of Q1 2022. There are 2 main changes in the balance sheet. One change is an increase in the short-term assets of EUR 46.1 million, which is driven by investments in the free cash flow with United Internet and the reduction of short-term liabilities by minus EUR 65.9 million.\nOn the next slide, you will see the cash flow. So the cash flow, the net inflow from operating activities with EUR 83.9 million in Q1 2022, which is lower than in the year before. The reduction is driven by changes in trade and other receivables and payables with minus EUR 59.8 million. And the year before, the balance out of this position was plus EUR 11.8 million. So that's the main driver for the lower net inflow. The cash flow from investment activities was minus EUR 77.4 million. In this position, we have the EUR 21.3 million CapEx and EUR 56 million investment of free cash flow with United Internet.\nThen we have the cash flow from financing activities with minus EUR 4.4 million, equal to the year before with EUR 4.1 million. And then the free cash flow, we finished the first quarter with a free cash flow of EUR 62.6 million.\nOn next slide, we have the EBITDA bridge. So we start with the EBITDA in Q1 2022 with the EUR 187.1 million. Then we have the negative balance out of the trade payables and other liabilities that I have already mentioned on the slide earlier, with minus EUR 56.5 million. The negative impact of minus EUR 13.3 million out of the other working capital positions. Taxes was minus EUR 33.4 million and CapEx of minus EUR 21.3 million. So we come to the free cash flow in the first quarter of EUR 62.6 million.\nNow I come to the forecast 2022. We would like to confirm our forecast for this year with service revenue of approximately EUR 3.2 billion. EBITDA on a previous year level of approximately EUR 672 million. In this EBITDA forecast are EUR 70 million included for the one-on-one network costs. The operating subscriber growth, we see approximately 650,000 new contracts, minus 200,000 contracts, which comes out of the shift to the recent amendment of the Telecommunication Act. We see also the EUR 400 million cash CapEx, which is mainly driven by 1&1 mobile network for antennas, computers and software. So many thanks for your attention so far. And now I would like to hand over to the operator for the Q&A session."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO, and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

During today's call, all references to industry results refer to the Black Box Intelligence casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden. During our fiscal Q2, average same restaurant sales for the industry grew 1.3%, and average same restaurant guest counts decreased 0.4%. Additionally, median same restaurant sales for the industry grew 1.9%, and median same restaurant guest counts decreased 0.5%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter. Raj will provide detail on our Q2 financial performance and share our updated fiscal 2026 financial outlook. Then, Rick will close with some final comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nThank you, Courtney. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter that exceeded our sales expectations as each of our segments delivered positive same restaurant sales. Commodity headwinds were stronger than we anticipated as beef prices remained at historically high levels throughout the quarter. Our restaurant teams did a great job of being brilliant with the basics during the quarter, driving record or near-record guest satisfaction scores across all of our brands. At the Darden level, we continue to leverage our four competitive advantages to enable our brands to compete effectively and continue providing strong value to our guests. The power of our scale enables us to continue to price below inflation over the long term and not pass all the costs on to our guests, while the breadth of our portfolio enables our brands to stick to their strategy even if they are overly impacted by a single commodity.\nWe opened 17 new restaurants during the quarter and are on pace to exceed our planned openings for the full fiscal year. These new restaurants opened faster than planned, collectively contributing 40 additional operating weeks versus our plan for the quarter. This is a testament to the outstanding job Todd Burrowes and the entire development team, led by Marc Braun, have done to strengthen our pipeline. Olive Garden delivered positive same restaurant sales of 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the success of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion and first-party delivery, combined with strong operational execution that led to all-time high guest satisfaction scores. For the fourth consecutive year, the starting price for Never Ending Pasta Bowl was $13.99. Preference was strong, and refill rates reached a record high, demonstrating that guests continue to find abundance and meaningful value at Olive Garden in this environment.\nFirst-party delivery, through our partnership with Uber Direct, continued to drive strong results. This channel attracts younger, more affluent guests who crave Olive Garden at home, value convenience, and order more frequently. These guests have a higher check average than dining guests. Uber Direct sales represented 4% of total sales for the quarter, and approximately half of that was incremental. As we have discussed on recent calls, across the portfolio, we are placing a greater emphasis on sales growth and reinvesting to drive long-term success. At Olive Garden, the success of first-party delivery is helping fund investments such as the addition of the lighter portion section on their menu, which features seven existing dishes with a smaller portion and a lower price. This section is designed to give guests more choices and is offered in addition to the Olive Garden's regular portion sizes.\nOlive Garden has seen a double-digit increase in affordability perceptions from guests who order from the lighter portions menu and an increase in frequency among these guests, which should help build traffic over time. 40% of restaurants offered this menu during the quarter, and they added another 20% of locations early in the 3Q. Olive Garden plans to complete the rollout system-wide in January. As we begin Q3, the Olive Garden team is poised to build on their momentum. They are currently offering two fan favorites for a limited time: Ravioli di Portobello and Braised Beef Tortelloni. Thousands of Olive Garden fans requested the return of these iconic dishes, which included multiple online petitions to bring them back.\nTurning to LongHorn Steakhouse, the team's ongoing commitment to their strategy, rooted in quality, simplicity, and culture, continued to guide their success as they delivered strong top-line momentum driven by same restaurant sales growth of 5.9%. Their relentless focus on executing every dish on their menu to their high standards was reflected in an all-time high steaks grilled correctly score for the quarter. Their ability to consistently operate at this high level is enabled by having one of the most experienced teams in the industry. In fact, LongHorn further strengthened their impressive retention by setting their record low for team member turnover during the quarter. The investments LongHorn has made in food quality, combined with their grilling expertise, have built strong guest loyalty.\nTo further build on their leadership in food quality, LongHorn brought back a guest favorite for the holidays, the 14-ounce 7-Pepper Crusted New York Strip with brown butter sauce, which was met with enthusiastic reviews by guests and social media influencers. Same restaurant sales for our other business segment grew 3.1% during the quarter, driven by strong performance at Yard House. During the quarter, Yard House's Oktoberfest event returned for the fifth year. This event continued to deepen guest engagement and drive results through limited-time menu offerings that strengthened Yard House's competitive advantages of a socially energized bar and distinctive culinary with broad appeal. The event also featured a $5 refillable beer stein that was a hit with guests, with all steins selling out within the first few weeks. Also during the quarter, Yard House began rolling out first-party delivery through our partnership with Uber Direct.\nWhile the impact on total sales won't be as significant as what we've seen at Olive Garden, the team is pleased with the initial results and plans to continue rolling it out to additional restaurants in Q3. Same-restaurant sales for the fine dining segment grew 0.8% for the quarter, driven by strong performance at Ruth's Chris Steak House and improving trends at The Capital Grille. As guests continued to seek price certainty, Ruth's Chris brought back its limited-time offer featuring a three-course menu for $55. It was a key driver of sales and traffic growth and featured a new eight-ounce prime thick-cut strip and two guest favorites, stuffed chicken, and salmon and shrimp. Each entrée came with a soup or salad, an individual side, and a dessert.\nThe Capital Grille's Wagyu & Wine event returned during the quarter, featuring a choice of a Dave Phinney wine and Wagyu burger for $35. This event delivered strong guest preference, and sales momentum at the Capital Grille continued to grow throughout the quarter. I am pleased with our performance as we move back into the back half of our year. Our brand teams have the appropriate plans in place, and the power of Darden positions us well to win in a competitive environment. Now, I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, the second quarter was another strong sales quarter for Darden, with top-line momentum exceeding our expectations. While elevated commodity costs driven by beef were a significant headwind for the quarter, we priced 130 basis points below inflation as we remain committed to providing strong value to our guests. This large investment in underpricing inflation resulted in restaurant-level margins being below last year. The near-record beef costs have sustained longer than we anticipated and are likely to remain elevated into the third quarter with some relief as we get into the fourth quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of total sales, 7% higher than last year, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4.3%, the addition of 30 net new restaurants, and the acquisition of Chuy's in October of last year.\nBoth our same restaurant sales and same restaurant guest counts were on the top decile of the industry again this quarter. Same restaurant sales exceeded the industry benchmark by 300 basis points, and the positive gap widened throughout the quarter. Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share from continuing operations of $2.08 were 2.5% higher than last year. We generated $466 million of Adjusted EBITDA and returned $396 million to our shareholders this quarter by paying $174 million in dividends and repurchasing $222 million in shares. Now, looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points higher, primarily due to elevated beef costs driving total commodities inflation of approximately 5.5% for the quarter. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points higher, with total labor inflation of 3.3%.\nRestaurant labor in our comparable restaurants was favorable to last year, driven by productivity improvements that more than offset pricing below labor inflation. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points higher as sales leverage was more than offset by Uber Direct fees and brand mix with the addition of Chuy's. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points lower due to sales leverage. We had incremental marketing activity in the quarter that was funded by cost savings. This all resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA of 18.7%. Adjusted G&A expenses were 60 basis points favorable, driven by leverage from sales growth and lower incentive compensation accrual, as well as favorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this favorability is fully offset in the tax line.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, and we generated $243 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 7.8% of sales. Looking at our segments, all segments grew sales for the quarter driven by positive same restaurant sales. The high beef costs pressured segment profit margins at all of our segments except for Olive Garden. Total sales for Olive Garden increased by 5.4%, driven by strong same restaurant sales and traffic growth, as well as the addition of 11 net new restaurants. The sales momentum continued from prior quarters with same restaurant sales in the top decile of the industry and outperformed the industry benchmark by 340 basis points.\nOlive Garden delivered a strong segment profit margin of 21.8% for the quarter, which was 30 basis points above last year, even with an approximate 20 basis points of margin investment related to the lighter portions menu and the continued impact of delivery fees. At LongHorn, total sales increased by 9.3%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 5.9% and the addition of 21 new restaurants. The sustained sales and traffic outperformance resulted in same restaurant sales and traffic in the top decile again this quarter. The LongHorn team is doing a great job of staying focused on their strategy and maintaining momentum despite elevated beef costs. Our measured approach in reacting to inflation resulted in pricing 320 basis points below inflation at LongHorn, that resulted in segment profit margin of 16.2%.\nTotal sales at fine dining segment increased 3.3%, driven by positive same restaurant sales and the addition of three net new restaurants. High beef costs also had a large impact on the brands in this segment, resulting in segment profit margin of 14.8%, 280 basis points lower than last year. The other business segment sales increased 11.3%, with positive same restaurant sales of 3.1% and the acquisition of Chuy's benefiting part of the quarter. The positive sales growth and the continued productivity improvements in multiple brands within this segment were not enough to fully offset the elevated commodity pressures from beef and the impact of delivery fee. This resulted in segment profit margin of 13.4%, 60 basis points lower than last year.\nTurning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2026, we have updated our guidance to reflect year-to-date performance, the evolving commodities environment, and the expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales growth for the year of 8.5% to 9.3%, same restaurant sales growth of 3.5% to 4.3%, 65 to 70 new restaurant openings, total capital spending of $750 million to $775 million, total inflation of approximately 3.5%, with commodities inflation of 4% to 5%, and approximately 116.5 million diluted average shares outstanding. All other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged, including adjusted diluted net earnings per share between $10.50 and $10.70, of which approximately $0.20 is related to the addition of 53rd week. We expect earnings per share growth in the third and fourth quarters to sequentially improve as the gap between pricing and total inflation narrows in the back half of the year.\nSpecifically for the third quarter, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits compared to the third quarter of last year. In summary, we're pleased with our strong top-line performance and continued industry outperformance this quarter. While our pricing strategy amid elevated commodity costs has impacted margins in the near term, we believe it's the right approach to support our long-term success. As we move through the rest of the fiscal year, we remain confident in our ability to grow sales, manage costs, and deliver value to our guests and shareholders. Now, I'll turn it back to Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nIs that time for the Q&A session, everyone?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nNo, no, sorry.\n\nOperator\n\nOh, sorry.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nIs that right?\nMy microphone's off. Sorry. As I reflect on our performance, I'm reminded of the power of the platform we've built over time and our ability to navigate whatever comes our way. When you look at our company, there are three key attributes that we believe make Darden a great company and a great stock. First, our winning strategy grounded in our four competitive advantages and our commitment to managing the business for the long term has led to a long track record of success. Over our 30-year history as a public company, Darden has achieved annualized total shareholder return of 10% or greater for any 10 fiscal year period when considering Darden stock appreciation plus dividend yield. Second, we have a clear roadmap to grow our portfolio of iconic brands, which includes two dominant brands, three high-potential growth brands, and several balanced brands that are leaders in their respective categories.\nAnd third, our strong commitment to disciplined capital stewardship enables us to return capital to shareholders while making appropriate investments in the business for long-term success. I'm incredibly proud of the results we continue to deliver for our shareholders, and we remain committed to executing our strategy to drive shareholder value now and for generations. Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Darden's first CEO, Joe Lee. Joe was a visionary leader whose leadership helped shape not only Darden, but the entire casual dining industry. I was fortunate to work with Joe, and one of the things that always stood out to me was the care and compassion he had for his people.\nHe always said, \"If you take care of your people, they will take care of your guests.\" Those words remain fundamental to Darden's culture today, and they are especially meaningful during the holidays. Now is the busiest time of the year in our restaurants, and I'm so proud of our 200,000 team members who do such a remarkable job of nourishing and delighting everyone they serve. On behalf of our entire leadership team and the Darden Board of Directors, thank you to all of our team members for everything you do. I wish you and your families a happy holiday season. Now we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to be placed into question queue, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, we ask you to please ask one question and one follow-up, then return to the queue. If you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star two. Once again, that's star one to place yourself into question queue, and please ask one question and one follow-up, then return to the queue. Our first question today is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning and happy holidays, and congratulations on solid top-line results. First question is on the lighter portions menu and the strategy as you roll that out to 100% of the Olive Garden restaurants here in January. How impactful do you think this will be to sales just based on what you've seen so far? Is it something that we're actually going to be able to identify here from the outside, or is it more of an impact to internal metrics like value perception, etc.?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Brian. It is an impact to internal metrics, value perception, affordability, and the right portion size. But we will see some impacts to sales in a couple of ways. In the long term, as we said, we've got higher frequency in the guests that are ordering this versus the guests that aren't. And the guests that aren't are increasing frequency as well. So this is a good top spin. In the short term, there will be a little bit of check mix. So as Raj mentioned, in the second quarter, we had about 20 basis points of mix from 20 or 30 basis points of mix from the lighter portion. As we roll it out to more restaurants, there'll be a little bit of bigger mix impact, but that's being offset by other things we have with the strong performance of delivery.\nIt might not be necessarily in mix offset, but in total sales. So we believe this is the right thing to do for our guests in the short term and the long term, and that's why we've actually accelerated the rollout.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks for that. My follow-up is on labor and the margins on labor. Over the last couple of quarters, you've seen some labor margin deleverage despite growing comps over 4% the last couple of quarters. What do you attribute this to? Because historically, you've been able to better leverage labor margins on these types of comps. Is there any specific investments going into labor or mix issues within the brands worth pointing out? How are you thinking about the ability to maybe better leverage labor margins moving forward?\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Brian. This is Raj. So from a labor margin perspective, I think I said in my prepared remarks, if you actually look at our comparable restaurants, which is where we obviously had the same restaurant sales growth, you have actually labor leveraging. We actually saw labor improve year-over-year, even with us underpricing inflation. Because labor inflation, as I said, was about 3.3%, our pricing was 2.6%. So we were able to offset that underpricing inflation and drive labor leverage through productivity improvements. The reason you don't see it at the total Darden level is because of the growth over the last year and the acquisition of Chuy's. And so that's really what you got to look at, the brand mix combined with some of the nuances. So it's more, I would say, idiosyncratic versus a systematic issue.\nWe actually feel like as we go through the back half, you should start to see labor start to be more of a good guy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. And congrats on this, particularly this Olive Garden same store sales result in the quarter, which should help with concerns about that brand lapping the tough comparisons coming up in the fourth quarter. But I'm wondering, what does your guidance generally anticipate with regard to Olive Garden comps going into that quarter? Are you factoring any benefit from fiscal stimulus? And just generally, what do you think you'll be doing in general to help maximize your chances of keeping positive comps going over those tough comparisons? And I have a quick follow-up.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, David, thanks for those comments. So from a same restaurant sales perspective, if you look at our guidance, we talked about for the full year, 3.5% to 4.3%, which essentially means roughly 2.5% to 4% in the back half, which would imply basically flat traffic at the midpoint of that range. I don't want to get specifically into the brands, but here is how we think about the total. When we look at taking into consideration the first half of the year, some macro uncertainty, but potential consumer spending benefit from the fiscal stimulus in early 2026. And we have several initiatives at the brand levels to drive sales. We feel like the outlook we provided is reasonable. And so I think that's really all I have to say on that front. Thanks.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThe other thing I'm curious about is how you're thinking about pricing versus the path of inflation on beef and steak. And clearly, I think you said something about your pricing was trailing inflation by three points or more. I think I didn't quite catch that at LongHorn. So, I'm just wondering about whether you think that, does your guidance anticipate additional pricing at LongHorn through the rest of the year? Any thoughts on that? Thank you.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, David. So yeah, on the pricing front, let me start at a bigger picture and then get back to LongHorn specifically. So we did price for the quarter at the Darden level, was about 130 basis points below inflation. We do expect that to cut in half by the time we get to Q3 and actually catch up to inflation as we get to Q4, primarily because of one, we're taking some pricing, but also we expect inflation to come down, especially as we go into Q4. Specifically at LongHorn, yeah, I don't expect LongHorn's to have underpricing by 320 basis points as you move forward. We'll take some modest price increases. But look, that's the benefit of the portfolio, right?\nWe've talked about, Rick mentioned this in his prepared remarks, that when there is some near-term pressure on one of the commodities, the portfolio provides the air cover to be able to kind of deal with this for the near term. And so all that said, look, our bias is to minimize pricing, and we'll do what we think is right to protect the guest, even if that means some margin erosion in the near term. Primarily, we're talking about Q2 and Q3 because we expect margin growth as we get into Q4.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst and Executive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thanks. Morning, guys. Raj, can you maybe just talk more about the beef piece and what kind of gives you the confidence that that starts to come down by Q4?\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Brian, I guess maybe let me start with what happened in the Q2 and how we're transitioning and how we see this because beef prices peaked in our fiscal Q2, and they were well above the normal seasonal trends due to supply constraints that stem from packer cutbacks and halted Mexican cattle imports due to the screwworm outbreak. We have seen retail demand destruction accelerate over the past few months, and we think November was actually down about 14% demand volume down in steaks. Prices have started to improve in recent weeks, and we've been able to take some coverage for the back half. I think this morning we showed about 45% coverage for the back half. Actually, as we're speaking, our team is getting a little bit more coverage.\nThe prices that we're the coverage we're getting at is at the levels that are in line with our updated thinking, and all of that is contemplated in our guidance. If you look at what happened in the near term, prices are expected to ease a little bit as beef production actually increased to near prior year levels the last couple of weeks, driven by packer profitability and lower cattle prices. Now, there is enough inventory on feedlot to support the recent production increase.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst and Executive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. With first-party delivery, is 4% of sales, is that kind of where you expected to be at this point? Or I guess, what else do you think could continue to push that higher if you, in fact, want that? Are you still seeing sort of sequential increases in delivery mix?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Brian, we're really pleased with 4%. As you recall, we didn't do any marketing. You didn't know that, but we didn't do any marketing in Q2, and we're at 4%. I think the way that would increase is if we do some more marketing and get more people into it. But it's tracking pretty closely to our overall-to-go business, and we feel good where that is with the incrementality we're getting. But if we want to drive that up, we have some options on the marketing side.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jacob Aiken-Phillips from Melius Research. Your line is now live.\n\nJacob Aiken-Phillips\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nHi, good morning. So I wanted to ask on Olive Garden delivery. You said about half of the 4% was incremental. But as delivery grows, do you expect the incremental share to hold, or does cannibalization increase with penetration? And then what are you doing operationally to try to preserve that incrementality?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nJacob, I would hypothesize that as delivery grows, the incrementality will stay where it is or get better, because it's these folks that are ordering delivery are higher frequency, a little bit younger, and more affluent. So as it grows, if it continues to grow, we would expect a little bit more incrementality until it wraps on itself, and then it's a little less there.\n\nJacob Aiken-Phillips\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nJust more broadly, you've talked about guests moving between channels depending on value or occasion. Have you seen any meaningful shifts in where full-service or casual dining fits into the broader food spend mix?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah. As you see, our sales performance and the casual dining industry itself, I think the industry has been growing faster than other segments, and we've been growing faster than the industry. So I would say that we're continuing to take share from casual, and we're taking share from a little bit on the limited service.\n\nJacob Aiken-Phillips\n\nVP of Equity Research, Melius Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next call today. This question today is coming from Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\n\nJake Bartlett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. My first was about marketing. And marketing as percentage of sales was down a little bit in Q2, I think roughly flat in Q1. What are your expectations for the year? Is it still the 10 to 20 basis points? And I guess that would imply an acceleration. Maybe if you can confirm that. And then I have a follow-up.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jake. So recall we said in the last quarter, I think we talked about we got about, call it roughly $20 million of savings in marketing with some of the great work our teams did to go back and take a look at how we spend the dollar. So anyway, when we take that into consideration, that helped increase marketing activity, even though the dollars were basically flat the last year. Now, as we look at the full year, we're probably closer to somewhere around 10 basis points increase year-over-year. But if something changes, we'll update you next quarter.\n\nJake Bartlett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. My follow-up was just on the macro environment. I'm not sure if I heard you kind of talk about what you're seeing from a consumer perspective, lower income, whether some of the weakness is bleeding up into the middle income. What is the baseline macro environment that you're basing the back half sales guidance on?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah. I would say that we see the same reports you see. We've said that before. But the consumer is still resilient. They're being cautious. As we've said a few times, the weaker consumer sentiment doesn't necessarily translate into reduced spending. During the quarter, so this is what's happening in our brand. During the quarter, our casual brand saw an increase of visits year-over-year from guests within middle to higher income groups. So it hasn't kind of moved up for us to the middle income groups, with the largest growth, though, coming from our higher income households. We did see strong traffic growth from guests 55 and over as well, so on the demographic side. But there was a little pullback in those earning less than 50,000 in the casual brands. But I'll end it with the way we always talk about it.\nWe know casual dining is the number one category where consumers intend to treat themselves and indulge. When they're kind of thinking about where they spend their hard-earned money, they want to go to a place that they get a great value and a good experience for a great price. We'll continue to focus on delivering an excellent experience and deliver value for every guest that chooses to dine with us.\n\nJake Bartlett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Raj, just curious, with the updated same-store sales guidance, does that impact any incremental pricing? You talked about the higher inflation forecast and how you're not going to fully price off that inflation. Just curious if there's an increased pricing factor contemplated within the updated guidance.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYes, Andrew. There is a little bit of increase in price. As I said, we actually expect our pricing to be closer to mid-threes in the back half for the full year to be close to 3%. So if you think about where we started the year, I think we were 2.2% in the Q1, 2.6% in the Q2. So there's a little bit of an increase there that we incorporated into our guidance.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nVery good. Thanks. And Rick, in the past, you've laid out your hesitations around listing Olive Garden on third-party delivery. And I'm curious if any of those pieces around things you've laid out in the past, like data sharing, tip sharing, the ability to throttle it on and off, do you believe are better addressable as ultimately contemplating the decision to add Olive Garden to third-party delivery?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Andrew. I would say the two big third-party delivery providers know what our concerns are on third-party. And as long as we get a solution for those concerns, then we would look at it. It wouldn't make sense for us not to look at it, but we really do have some concerns, and they know what they are.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. My first question is just on the comp commentary. I think, Raj, you mentioned that the favorable gap to the industry improved through fiscal Q2. I was wondering whether you would assume or you are assuming that that continues. Maybe you have some quarter-to-date Q3 numbers, but your assumption for the back half of the year in terms of maybe a further widening of that gap. And then I had a follow-up.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jeff. Look, we did see an increase in our performance. We've said historically, when industry slows down a little bit, we widen the gap. But as we look at the back half, we don't really start with what the industry numbers are. We actually look at a lot of what's macro and then all the things I mentioned about the brand initiatives because industry is a representation of some of it, but not all of it. So we just do it differently. I don't want to comment on what we expect the gap to be going forward.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nUnderstood. And then the follow-up is just on the Uber addition. It sounds like Yard House is next up, third in line, therefore behind Olive Garden and Cheddar's. I think you mentioned it's not likely to be as meaningful of a contributor as it is more of a bar-type concept. But just wondering where LongHorn sits, or where I know you don't dictate it, so where perhaps management of LongHorn specifically think about it. It would seem like that's the next big brand that could have more of a meaningful contribution. But offsetting that, I know often discuss that maybe their food doesn't travel as well. So just wondering your updated thoughts in terms of whether LongHorn could add 1P delivery. Thank you.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jeff. I'll start with the Yard House part. We don't anticipate it to be as big an impact because Yard House is a smaller brand, not just because they're a bar, but they also do a little bit lower to-go business. So you think about when we implemented it at Olive Garden and then at Cheddar's, the percent delivery aligned up pretty well with the percent to-go. So Cheddar's right now, I think, is doing about 15% off-premise. LongHorn does about 15% off-premise. So it's not a small off-premise business. And we do know that when guests order at LongHorn off-premise, the mix is different. So they order more chicken and seafood, and a little less steak than they do in the dining room. So it's something that LongHorn is learning from the other brands to see if it makes sense for us to go onto Uber Direct.\nIf it does, then we'll start testing it. But we don't have anything to say about that right now.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I was interested just on the topic of value. It sounds like that's resonating even actually in fine dining. You talked about these sort of combos and these and the $55 at Ruth's. I guess, are you bringing in different customers across the brands? I mean, I know you mentioned maybe some softness in below 50, but if I just think about, well, the pricing may be up low single digits, there's presumably some negative mix, and the sort of entry-level price points are lower across, sounds like across maybe all your brands. So are you seeing different customers come in for that, or is it just more increasing frequency among the customers you do have as you offer these kinds of very accessible price points?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYes, Sara. Most of our promotions really help our core customers. We are seeing a little bit of an increase in new customers or customers who haven't seen in a while when we do these. But we actually see an increase in our core too. So it's not targeted for new people. It's targeted for anybody. And we do see a little bit of a mix at Ruth's Chris when we do the $55 prix fixe menu. But that's because guests are looking for certainty and price certainty. And so that's what we're giving them. And it drives quite a bit of volume at Ruth's Chris, and it's a good thing for us. It's a profitable deal for us.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. Right. Thank you. Understood. And then just on the follow-up, Raj, you mentioned I think that demand has declined about 14% in November for beef. I guess, are there certain kind of rules of thumb about what that would mean for beef prices? Just as I think about it, it seems like this is the first time we've really seen retail demand pull back. So just trying to understand how that translates into kind of the market prices for beef. Thanks.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah. I would say the last few months have been different from what we would have seen historically. Historically, there was retail demand destruction. You saw the prices come down sooner. I don't want to get into a lot of the dynamics, but there is something between the packers and how things are working. It seems like there is some constraining of supply. But it's hard for us to really know what's happening. Maybe there are other challenges. So it's really going to be a function of how much production is out there, right? And so, yeah, I don't think we have a good crystal ball on that. But I did share we are seeing some green shoots, and that's what we're actually starting to see, the coverage that's coming more in line with our expectations.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jim Salera from Stephens. Your line is now live.\n\nJim Salera\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nHey, Raj. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Raj, I wanted to start and maybe ask if you could give us the comp components for Olive Garden, breaking out particularly mix and traffic. As an add-on to that, are you able to give us any details around the type of consumer that you're seeing in the near term with Olive Garden, given that it's a well-established brand, but they have a lot more avenues that consumers can access the brand now? I wonder if that has any noticeable changes in the type of guests, whether it's income level, age, group sizes, anything like that you could provide would be great.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah. So from an Olive Garden breakdown, the same-restaurant sales were 4.7%. The traffic, as we measure, was 1.7%. But when you add the catering of 1.1%, that's basically a traffic growth of 2.8%. And their pricing was 2.6%. So there was some negative mix, but also there was some help from Uber Direct fees. But that's the mix of the traffic and the sales. From a guest perspective, I think Rick already addressed it in the script or in his prepared remarks about we're seeing more increased growth across all income levels above $50,000. And we're seeing a little bit more growth as we move up the age spectrum. There's a little bit of a pullback, the below $50,000 and lower or younger folks. But that's really it.\n\nJim Salera\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nOkay. And then, if I could shift gears a little on LongHorn, continued outperformance there, I think value steak in general. Is there any way for us to maybe match that up with the outperformance in fine dining as well? Because I think a lot of people expect the value to continue to do well, but we're surprised by the outperformance in fine dining. I don't know if there's a read to make there, if there's some maybe aspirational guests that are accessing fine dining, or if we just reached a point where we've lapped enough and the sales base is lower that we can get back to positive on fine dining.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Jim, I'll start with LongHorn. And I think LongHorn, their outperformance is driven by years of what they've done, focusing on their strategy. Continue to price a little below inflation, invest in their food, and cook their steaks better. And that's been very helpful for them. Now, I think they may be benefiting right now with such a high price of beef that consumers are actually going to LongHorn instead of eating at home. And when we talk about the $50,000 consumer under $50,000, I think LongHorn grew under $50,000. So it's interesting. They have a higher check than Olive Garden, but they grew their guest count at an under $50,000 range. That could be because of such a disparity between how much you have to pay in the grocery store versus what you pay in the restaurant, which could be driving some of the traffic growth.\nBut it is impacting their margin. So on the fine dining side, I'll finish with one other thing at LongHorn. I still think they might be taking a little bit of share from fine dining. That said, fine dining had a good quarter this quarter. The trends are improving. And it may be that we're getting closer to kind of clearing everything out that happened during COVID. We're seeing some good value, some good performance at Ruth’s Chris. Capital Grille had a good quarter. But it's not over yet. We've got to see that continue for a while to feel really great about it. We feel good about it. We only feel great about it.\nSo as we think about what's happening in the industry, we continue to say that as long as we do the things that we're supposed to do, provide a great value, cook the food properly, give a great experience to our guests, they're going to be coming back.\n\nJim Salera\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nGreat. I appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nRestaurants Industry Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. Can you just help unpack what you saw in terms of cadence of actual comp as you move through the quarter? I know there's a lot of volatility and noise in the industry. Anything that you can provide on what you're seeing quarter-to-date as well as differences that you may be seeing across regions. Thank you.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Lauren. I don't want to get into the quarterly cadence of comps, but I'll just say from an earnings perspective, I think we kind of provided a high level how we're thinking about it. And it's really more driven by pricing. As I said, pricing gap to inflation is expected to cut in half as we get into Q3 as we take a little bit more price. And inflation actually is probably closer to the Q2 level. But then as we get to the Q4, we expect pricing to go up a little bit more and inflation to come down a little bit more. And so that's kind of why we talked about what we expect earnings growth to be more in the Q3 to be in the mid-single-digits. But I don't want to get too much into the quarterly sales comp.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nRestaurants Industry Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then just on stimulus, there's some excitement about stimulus into 2026. If you go back to prior fiscal stimulus, which brands tend to benefit the most in your portfolio? And do you see it through traffic or average check?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Lauren, I would say all of our brands benefit from stimulus depending on how it comes in. But I will say that if you think about the folks that benefit from no tax on tips and no tax on overtime, they may be median income and lower. So that could help our brands like Olive Garden, Cheddar's, or Chuy's that have a little bit higher mix there. But all of our brands benefit when there's stimulus that gives more money to consumers.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nRestaurants Industry Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the conversation around the marketing efforts around Uber Direct. I think you guys mentioned you didn't do any marketing this quarter. Can you just talk about that decision and what's the game plan in the back half of the year? Are you planning on increasing marketing around that effort? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Peter. The reason we didn't do any marketing on Uber Direct in the Q2 was we had just kind of done some in Q1. And we had other things that we wanted to spend our marketing dollars on, particularly Never Ending Pasta Bowl is our best promotion at Olive Garden. And I think others had some concern that we were wrapping on Never Ending Pasta Bowl and how that would go. And as Raj mentioned, our gap to the industry grew every month in the quarter, even though Never Ending Pasta Bowl was kind of coming towards the end of the promotion period. So we think that we were better off spending marketing dollars on Never Ending Pasta Bowl than we are on delivery at that time.\nI can't comment on if we're going to do it in the Q3 or Q4, but it's something that people will see pretty quickly if we do.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nGreat. And then just following up, my last question on tariffs. Is there any sort of update on the impact there, tariffs on either commodities or on development costs? I think in the past you had mentioned there was maybe a slight impact on development costs from tariffs. Just any update on that front would be helpful too.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Peter, not a lot. I mean, at this point, part of our commodities inflation includes some of the tariff impact. It's in the tens of basis points as a percent of sales, which is in line with what we had indicated earlier. From a construction cost, I'd say we're still, from the data we're seeing, it's in that mid-single-digit impact. No change there. Thanks.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nManaging Director and BTIG Restaurants and Food Distributors Analyst, BTIG\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jon Tower from Citi. Your line is now live.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHey, great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe going back to the small plates that you're rolling out now and getting it done by January. I'm just curious, have you tested any media behind it and what's your intention behind doing that? Obviously, you're seeing a bit of negative mix now that you've rolled it out to some of the stores. So how are you thinking about communicating it to guests? And obviously, there could be some pressure on the business if you were to market it to them. So how are you thinking about the trade-off there?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Jon, currently we're not expecting or we're not thinking about marketing it to our guests because it's doing pretty well on the menu the way it is. It's driving a little bit more frequency and the guests would order it. Maybe the word of mouth from other guests will do that. Our plans right now don't include marketing it, but those could change.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Is this something that will be available to delivery, so 1P guests as well?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants",
    "content2": "Yes. The way we think about 1P is if it's on our menu, it's probably available for delivery.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Cool. And then just on the unit growth update, it's nice to see you guys taking up the numbers by another five, potentially, for the year. Can you just give us some color on where you're seeing those numbers or what brands it's coming from? And then is this just a pull forward from what you were thinking for fiscal 2027?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Jon. When we're talking about five restaurants, it's a couple of brands that are driving that. Without telling you exactly which one, because that can change throughout the year where we end up at the fiscal year. We did say 65-70. It isn't necessarily a pull forward from next year that doesn't get backfilled by other brands. We don't anticipate that this year's growth a little bit ahead of plan will damper next year's because our teams are out there working hard, going and finding sites and getting deals done faster than they had before. As you recall, in the June call, I said that we are farther along in development than any point in any June we've had in years. We feel really good about it. That team is still doing great work to get us more sites.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions and happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.\n\nJeff Farmer\n\nRestaurants Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThank you. With all the pushes and pulls, how are you guys thinking about the fiscal 2026 restaurant level margin versus fiscal 2025?\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jeff, I would just refer you back to the long-term framework. And we've talked about that we put out at the beginning of the year. And we said we're focused on earnings after tax margin, a flat to positive 20 basis points. And I think our guidance still implies we're going to be in that range, give or take 10 basis points, but that's kind of how we look at it. We don't want to get too bogged down on any one level of one line item. We manage the business holistically to get a good return to the investor. And I would encourage you all to look at it through that lens.\n\nJeff Farmer\n\nRestaurants Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Then with your top line exceeding expectations for the second consecutive quarter, I appreciate that there's some incremental costs or greater than expected costs that you guys are incurring. Are there areas where you're increasing reinvestment relative to prior expectation with that better top line performance?\n\nOperator\n\nPerhaps your phone is on mute.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nThis is the microphone. Yeah, Jeff, we are making investments with these incremental sales. Primarily, it's in the lighter portion section on the Olive Garden menu. We're rolling out faster than we anticipated. We had originally expected to roll it out over the fiscal year and maybe even into next fiscal year, but it's doing so well. And in delivery is doing so well. We just decided to keep going. We're also making big investments and still pricing below inflation.\n\nJeff Farmer\n\nRestaurants Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now live.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nSenior Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask the latest on the operational efforts or the speed of service efforts. I know it's a longer-term initiative that you've touched on previously, but just any updates on the implementation of that or how you're thinking about the plan?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Dennis, every brand's implementing it a little differently depending on what they need to do. I would say that some brands are getting their speed up faster than other brands. But all brands are making some improvement. And again, this is going to take a lot of effort and a lot of time to convince a group of folks that they have to do something a little differently than they thought. And to help the teams understand that the guests want things faster, and we don't really get a whole lot of complaints about being too fast. We get them about being too slow. So those are the things that we have to keep doing. This is changing people's habits, and that takes a while. But we're seeing some improvement.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nSenior Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, Rick. Just to follow up on that, I know the genesis of the plan is to improve the customer experience, etc., more so than table turns, I believe. But an obvious benefit over time, if this goes well, presumably, is your table turns move notably, and maybe there's a traffic benefit that you see from this. Is that fair?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nAbsolutely. I think, especially during peak times, if we can get speed better, then table turns should speed up. And it would increase traffic during those times. But I think it'll increase traffic long-term anyway because people are getting the experience they want at the pace they want, and they'll come back more often.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nSenior Research Analyst, UBS\n\nMakes good sense. Thanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Could you give us just kind of a Cheddar's brand update? And not a lot of call out there. I imagine there's some pressure just given the success of some big bar and grill concepts right now. But just kind of where that stands and what you might look at as a key for more unit growth there.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Andy. Cheddar's is part of the other segment. The other segment also grew same restaurant sales. Cheddar's didn't disappoint. They grew their same restaurant sales as well. Even if other bar and grills are kind of out there talking a little bit more, a lot more about value, Cheddar's is still doing what they do, providing great everyday experience with wow pricing. The other thing that we've been able to do over the years is to significantly improve their operational turnover. If you think about turnover, when we bought Cheddar's, it was well, well above the industry average. Now it's below industry average. It's much closer to Darden averages for turnover. That means a better experience. We do believe that Cheddar's is one of those brands that I mentioned earlier that have high potential for growth.\nAnd what I would say is I want to remind everybody that we think that growing way too fast is an issue in the industry. So our growth rates for any of our brands won't exceed 10%. But for Cheddar's, this year is the year that they're kind of finalizing and building their pipeline. And so it might take a year or so before you start seeing a little bit more growth at Cheddar's.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Appreciate it. And then, Raj, can you just go through, I missed some of the Olive Garden, the components of same-store sales?\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nSure, Andy. So the traffic, as we measure, was up 1.7%. Catering was another 1.1%. So I'd say really the traffic growth was 2.8%. And then the check was 2.6%. Yeah. And then.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nNot check, sorry. Pricing was 2.6%. So if you look at it through that lens of 2.8%, then the implied check would be 1.9%.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now live.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, is there a plan to take the smaller portion approach with any of the other brands?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nWe do have another brand testing smaller portions of current menu items. But they're doing it in a different way, and not as many items. So there are some brands that lead to being able to do different kinds of portions based on the protein. And so other brands already have it. So you think about LongHorn has different sizes for some steaks. They're testing a little bit more. They have different sizes for their chicken tenders, so does Cheddar's, I believe. So we do have other brands doing it, but not at the same way. We don't have a separate section on the menu for it.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nOkay. Just based on the company's research on GLP-1 usage, do you see a need to make any additional changes beyond the smaller portions to kind of accommodate these consumers?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nWe're continuing to monitor the usage and the impact on eating and drinking. It's impacting drinking more than it's impacting eating, especially in our kind of brands. The data that we see is they're basically pulling back on some restaurant visits, but more so limited service. That said, the lighter portion section is helpful for that. But we aren't doing the lighter portion just for GLP-1s. We're doing it to give all of our guests more options. It just so happens to benefit the consumers that might want smaller portions that are on GLP-1 medications. We have a lot of options like that in all of our menus.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\n\nAndrew Strelzik\n\nRestaurant Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your comments that the Olive Garden delivery was tracking with the broader off-premise business. Does that surprise you at all? I mean, it's supposed to be a different guest. It's as incremental as it is earlier in the life cycle. Just kind of curious for your perspective on that.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nNo, Andrew, it doesn't surprise us. They're more similar to off-premise guests than on-premise guests. So if you think about Olive Garden and the percent of sales they do with to-go, and you look at the ratio of what they do off-premise versus delivery, then I would expect that same ratio to happen at our other brands because they are more similar. Our off-premise guests that are not delivery are also a little bit higher frequency than on-premise guests. These are just the delivery guests are even higher frequency. So it wasn't surprising that the same kind of mix happened at other brands.\n\nAndrew Strelzik\n\nRestaurant Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nOkay. All right. And then just curious on the changing CapEx guide. Is that all the new units? And with the updated new unit guide, you're close to the low end of your updated range. What's a realistic timeline to start pushing kind of higher towards the higher end of that range? Thanks.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nWell, so let's start with the CapEx part of it. So CapEx is really a function of saw the openings happening sooner than we planned at the beginning of the year. And again, kudos to the team for doing a great job on that. But it's also a function of what we're as we fill up the pipeline for next year because the spending this year happens for some of the restaurants opening, especially in the front half of next year. So we feel good about the pipeline. We just updated our framework to reflect 3% to 4% unit growth contribution from new units. And we think we're going to be in that range based on what we provided here.\n\nAndrew Strelzik\n\nRestaurant Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. Stepping back and looking at the long term, you have been outperforming the industry for quite some time. And I was wondering if you were to decompose these outperformance versus the industry, on which consumer cohorts are you winning the most? And I don't mean just by income level, but also maybe occasions, age. And as you're maturing your brands, how do you see these outperformance to continue?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Danilo, I would say that granularity of data on where we're outperforming more is a little bit harder to get because we don't know where other parts of the industry are getting their guests. We do know that we've had over the last couple of years a little bit better performance in our higher-income consumer than not. But I would say during COVID, we had a great performance in our lower-income consumer. So it's really hard to say where we're getting the outperformance versus the industry. I can just tell you we've got a great portfolio of brands that meet all the different consumer needs. And so if a higher-income consumer is feeling great, we've got great brands for them. If a lower-income consumer is feeling great, we've got great brands for them. So that's the beauty of our portfolio. And that's what makes us pretty different than most.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. And then I want to follow up on your comments on GLP-1. Specifically, I think your brands have enough flexibility within your menu to offer different options for consumers and solve different needs. I was wondering if you can comment also on how the spending behavior is changing, not just on the alcohol mix, but also on the eating behavior, whether you see a greater mix of protein, fewer desserts instead. What's your best estimate on how this is going to be evolving over time and how it will be impacting the overall spending behavior in the industry?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nI would say the only real big change in mix that we're seeing is in alcohol sales. We've been seeing that for a little while. You can see that more in the fine dining brands and the other brands. We're not seeing a dramatic change. We are seeing a little bit of mix in appetizers and desserts, probably from some folks that are on GLP-1 drugs. Because I think when people get on GLP-1s, they also want to try to change their lifestyle. They want to eat a little less fried food. If you think about most restaurants, appetizers are fried. So that could be part of it. But we've got a broad menu. We are going to continue to monitor what's going on with folks on GLP-1 drugs.\nWe believe we have great brands that have a lot of protein, which is something that GLP-1 users want. And I would say we've got a great brand that was designed 20 years ago that is in the sweet spot of GLP-1s, and that's Seasons 52. So we've got a lot of things that we can offer folks on those medications and anybody else. So I don't want to focus just on GLP-1 users. We've got a broad portfolio that can serve any guest need.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your line is now live.\n\nGregory Francfort\n\nRestaurants Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nHey, thanks for the question. Raj, can you just maybe give us an update on where turnover sits, either for Olive Garden or your total system for labor? And do you think we're in a different environment now than we were the last few years and what that might look like going forward? Thanks.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Greg. I would just say the turnover is actually pretty low. We continue to be better year-over-year. I think we're still trending probably double-digit increase versus prior year from a turnover, essentially lower turnover. So I think for most of our brands, this is like a record low. Yeah. So from that perspective, we feel really good about that environment. I think the other factor I'll mention is our hourly wage rate inflation on the hourly wage was about 3%. This is kind of lower than what we saw even before COVID. We used to be in the mid-3%. So to be around 3% tells you that the labor environment is actually pretty solid for us.\n\nGregory Francfort\n\nRestaurants Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nAwesome. Thanks for the perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\n\nBrian Vaccaro\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey, thank you. I just had a question on Olive Garden. And Rick, you spoke to the strength of Never Ending Pasta. I was just curious, was the sales mix up on NEP year on year? And are you seeing any changes in the mix, kind of the entry-level price point versus the higher tiers? And could you comment also just on the lighter portions? I think the sales mix was running mid-single-digits last time we heard. Have you seen that increase the longer it's been in the market?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Brian, I would start with the Never Ending Pasta Bowl. we did see a little bit more mix to Never Ending Pasta Bowl, so a little bit more preference in it. We did see a much stronger refill rate. I think we had our record refill rate potentially. And we did see a little bit fewer buy-ups to the more protein. But it could be because we've got more guests coming in and because the refills were so high that they were getting great value. In regards to the lighter portion menu, still about somewhere 1.5%, but around. So it could be up 10 basis points, down 10 basis points here, there. As we talk about frequency growing, it's going to take a while for that frequency to really make a meaningful impact in that mix. And we feel good about that mix.\n\nBrian Vaccaro\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nAll right. That's helpful. And then, Raj, just a quick one on G&A, if I could. It came in lower than we were expecting here in the current quarter. I know there's quarter-to-quarter volatility. But could you just give a quick update on where you see G&A shaking out within your fiscal 2026 guidance? Thanks very much.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Brian, I'd say we're still probably at our— when we look at the full year, we're probably going to be still close to $500 million. Q4 is probably $15 million-$20 million higher than Q3. Part of it is because of the 53rd week and some seasonal stuff. But really, no change to the total guidance for G&A.\n\nBrian Vaccaro\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Your line is now live.\n\nJim Sanderson\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nHey, thanks for the question and the time. Just wanted to follow up on the lighter portions at Olive Garden. Anything to call out that's notable about the demographics of the consumer that is purchasing this light portion, whether by gender, household income, daypart, anything like that?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jim, we're still doing some more work on that. You think about, we haven't had it in all the restaurants. We're talking about 1.5% of sales. You think about the number of tokens we have for that. It's going to take us a little bit of time to get that work.\n\nJim Sanderson\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nAll right. And just another quick follow-up. Anything to comment on with respect to holiday bookings? Are they exceeding your expectations for the current timeframe, maybe inline? Just anything you would provide as a test on how the consumer is behaving?\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Jim, two things. One, in regards to Thanksgiving, which was already happening, we had record Thanksgivings in our fine dining brands, our reservation brands. Our holiday bookings are strong.\n\nJim Sanderson\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Northcoast Research\n\nAll right. Thank you very much.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you so much. So the question is on immigration broadly. And I was hoping we could touch on a couple of maybe related topics to that. Firstly, I heard the comments, obviously, that labor inflation is now running lower than even it was pre-COVID. So that must mean that your supply of labor overall is very good. But I wonder if there's anything happening kind of below the surface that maybe in certain restaurants, certain pockets that labor markets have kind of turned over, but you've just been able to replace the people that perhaps would have left or maybe gotten competed away. So that's kind of the first question. And then secondly, make a comment if you can in terms of pockets of demand.\nI think I remember you using the word that there may have been some ripples of kind of demand being affected in various markets. So I wanted to see if there was a change there. And then the third point, there's a comment made on beef packers that maybe were constraining some supply. I wonder, and this just actually came to mind when you said that, if there may be kind of an immigrant worker situation on the packer side, if that could potentially be a leading indicator for other types of industries. So just the overall, your view on this broadly important topic. Thank you.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nHey, Jim, thanks. I'll try to get those answers, and maybe Raj can jump in too. On the immigration front, on our team members, we really haven't seen anything material on any restaurants turning all of their team members for those reasons. As we mentioned, we've got record retention. So there might be a restaurant or two that had a few folks, but it's not something that we're too worried about. In regards to the packer situation, we can't comment on what's going on and why there might be some supply constraints. I don't think it's necessarily driven by labor. Although one supplier did close one of their plants. I don't know if that was a labor issue or not. They didn't comment on why. And then Raj can talk about the sales impact for us.\n\nRaj Vennam\n\nCFO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, from a regional difference, John, I'd say for the quarter, when we look at second quarter, Midwest was our strongest growth. And then I think we saw actually softness in sales in New England area and then Pacific Northwest. Other than that, most others were pretty close to the median. Even Florida and Texas, which were lagging, were actually still below the company average, but they were a little bit closer to the company average than they were a quarter ago.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is coming from Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much. Follow-up to the earlier question of the casual dining outperformance. With many other segments kind of playing catch-up on value, could you kind of talk about your plans to better communicate value to consumers? Any new or expanded marketing approaches you are planning for the back half? And additionally, I think Rick, you mentioned that you have no imminent plans to market the lower portion size menus. But what would make you change your mind? Thank you.\n\nRick Cardenas\n\nPresident and CEO, Darden Restaurants\n\nYeah, Christine, competitively, I don't want to get into too much detail about our plans, especially for each brand. We're disciplined and remain committed to our marketing filters. And as you all remember, the marketing filters is, does the message build brand equity? Is it simple to execute and not a deep discount? And so we're going to continue to pull the right levers like we did with Never Ending Pasta Bowl, Oktoberfest at Yard House, the three-course menu at Ruth's Chris, Wagyu & Wine at The Capital Grille. Those are all things that elevate everything that we talk about without a deep discount. And you look at our promotional calendar last year for the back half, I wouldn't anticipate it's going to be significantly different than that. Now, on the lighter portion menu and marketing, yes, right now we have no plans to do it.\nIf that changes, we'll have to find the right way to communicate it. But it'll have to be something that we feel like we've got a great way to communicate it to explain what it is for consumers that don't really know that section of the menu. But I think that there's a better way to do that, which is just let the consumer tell their friends. And so right now, we don't have plans to do it. But if that changes, it's because Olive Garden came up with a great way to talk about it.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.\n\nCourtney Aquilla\n\nVP of Finance and Investor Relations, Darden Restaurants\n\nThat concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release Q3 results on Thursday, March 19th, before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating on today's call, and happy holidays, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. Let me just connect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."

(Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKevin Kalicak\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Analysis, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.\nAs a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.\nToday's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We plan to release fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nThis morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance, Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal '22 financial outlook, and then Gene will have some closing comments.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Gene.\n\nEugene I. Lee\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter was one of stark contrast, and I'm pleased with our performance in this highly volatile environment. Our team did a great job controlling what they could control. In fiscal December, we achieved record sales while meeting our internal profit expectations that were contemplated in the guidance we provided in December. However, in fiscal January, which is a high-volume period for us, the Omicron variant significantly impacted consumer demand, restaurant staffing and operating expenses. We also experienced substantial weather impacts, all of which resulted in significantly lower sales and earnings than our internal expectations.\nFinally, as COVID cases declined and the operating environment normalized, sales improved throughout fiscal February, and we had strong results that exceeded our internal expectations. Sales strength has continued into March. Quarter-to-date, our average weekly sales are slightly ahead of our February actuals, and these trends are incorporated in our guidance.\nWhen we talked last in December, we could not have predicted the impacts Omicron would have on our business. In fact, the dramatic spike in cases create the most difficult operating environment since the initial onset of COVID 2 years ago. Rick will provide more details on the impact it had on our staffing levels in a moment. Omicron also created additional pressure on expenses at the restaurant level as we saw higher levels of sick pay and we incurred significant overtime costs due to staffing shortages caused by exclusions. The January spike also caused further supply chain disruptions, and we now expect inflation to be higher in Q4 than when we talked in December. We have implemented pricing actions to mitigate the impacts of rising costs, and Raj will provide more detail in his remarks.\nWe recognize that all of us in the industry faced additional risk due to the current geopolitical environment such as higher inflation and further supply chain disruptions. However, I'm confident that Darden can compete effectively in any operating environment. We have a strong balance sheet and the right strategy in place, driven by our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere.\nNow I'll turn it over to Rick.\n\nRicardo Cardenas\n\nPresident & COO, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Our restaurant teams are focused on executing at the highest level in creating exceptional experiences for every one of our guests. That's why we are committed to doing what it takes to have the people we need and the products our guests expect when they choose to dine with us.\nFrom a people perspective, we are seeing positive momentum in applicant numbers, and we feel much better about where we are now in terms of overall staffing. Our focus will continue to be on hiring and more importantly, training our new team members to reach the productivity level required to enable us to operate at optimum staffing levels.\nOur biggest staffing challenge during the quarter was managing the impacts of team member and manager exclusions due to Omicron. To provide some context, at the peak, team member exclusions in January were 3x higher than the monthly peak we experienced with Delta. While we did get some help as the CDC guidelines for exclusion were reduced from 10 to 5 days, 8% of our total workforce was excluded at some point during January.\nTo put a finer point on this, in the month of January, we had over 13,000 team members excluded for a total of more than 65,000 exclusion days. I am really proud of how our teams managed through the impacts of Omicron. As it moved across the country, we had some restaurants that were down as much as 40% of their staff and others that needed to limit their hours were temporarily moved to takeout only in order to operate effectively.\nAs Omicron began to fade, our teams kept the same level of focus on staffing and training to provide a great guest experience, which resulted in record sales for fiscal February. Valentine's Day was strong across all our brands, and that is a testament to the excellent job our operators are doing to ensure their restaurants are staffed and ready to serve our guests. In fact, on Valentine's Day, Olive Garden served more than 1 million guests with approximately 35% of sales off-premise.\nOn the product side, our supply chain team is working hard leveraging our scale to ensure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels remained strong, and some of the logistical challenges we had been dealing with began to improve in December. However, Omicron impacted staffing for our supply chain partners in January as well. For labor-intensive food production, this resulted in reduced supply and increased cost at a time when protein prices typically shift down from the heavy holiday buying season.\nOur distribution partners also experienced warehouse staffing challenges and driver shortages. Thus, we had expedited shipping costs and utilized more spot rate haulers in the quarter. Between those impacts and dealing with back-to-back winter storms, our team did an admirable job of maintaining supply continuity for our restaurants. Together, all of these factors increased our expected annual inflation, and Raj will provide more color on that in a moment.\nTo Go sales remained strong during the quarter as our brand and our guests continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. Off-premise sales accounted for 30% of total sales at Olive Garden and 16% of total sales at Longhorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 63% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 12% of Darden's total sales.\nBefore I turn it over to Raj, I want to thank all of our team members who have shown tremendous resiliency and dedication in the face of constant change. Two years ago, we closed our dining room and did not know when we would be able to reopen them. Since then, we have dealt with multiple COVID waves, and our teams continue to demonstrate incredible flexibility and perseverance while creating exceptional guest experiences.\nToday, we are hopeful that we are near the end of the COVID-19 as a pandemic and that we will be able to live with it like we do with other viruses. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our team members, they say each day feels a little more normal, and they are invigorated by the energy that has returned to our dining room. Our team members are the best in the business. I'm inspired by their winning spirit and confident that Darden's best days are ahead of us.\nNow I'll turn it over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Vennam\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to expand on Gene and Rick's comments regarding the impact of Omicron and winter weather on our third quarter results. When looking at the fiscal months, actual sales for December and February were close to our internal expectations that were contemplated in the financial outlook we provided in December. And we met our profitability expectations in December and exceeded them in February. In fiscal January, however, we were significantly below our sales and profitability expectations as COVID cases surge, causing increased staffing shortages and reduced demand.\nWe also experienced more severe winter weather than historical averages. As a result, sales were negatively impacted by over $100 million. This sales down, a slowdown, coupled with additional expenses related to sick pay, overtime and increased inflation, negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.30 and was more than 100 basis points drag on EBITDA margins for this quarter.\nNow turning to the detailed results for the quarter. Total sales for third quarter were $2.4 billion, 41% higher than last year, driven by 38% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Total EBITDA was $395 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 16.1%, 50 basis points better than pre-COVID.\nWe continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $141 million in dividends and repurchasing $382 million in shares for a total of over $520 million cash returned to investors in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $555 million of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to see increasing cost pressure with inflation -- with total inflation of 7% this quarter, which was higher than our previous expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, we began taking additional pricing in the third quarter and have also implemented additional actions to further preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests.\nFor the third quarter, total pricing was 3.7%. And for the fourth quarter, we expect our pricing to be approximately 6% compared to last year. As a result, we now expect pricing to be just over 3% for the full fiscal year. This is well below our updated total inflation expectations of 6% for the year as we continue to execute our strategy of pricing below overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position.\nTurning to our P&L and segment performance for the third quarter. We are comparing against pre-COVID results in the third quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity.\nFor the third quarter, food and beverage expenses were 270 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodities inflation as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Our commodity inflation this quarter was 11%.\nRestaurant labor was 50 basis points higher, driven by wage inflation, higher sick pay and overtime expense as a result of Omicron. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was just over 9%. Restaurant labor as a percent of sales in fiscal December and February was better than pre-COVID as these months did not experience the same scale of headwinds from Omicron.\nRestaurant expenses were 80 basis points lower as our teams continue to manage controllable expenses. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 190 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 19.4%, 50 basis points below pre-COVID levels for the quarter. However, both in December and February, restaurant-level EBITDA margins grew by almost 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID.\nG&A expense was [90] basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense, lower travel expenses, and sales leverage.\nTurning to our segment performance. Sales and segment profit margins significantly increased versus last year for all of our segments. As we compare to pre-COVID, all segments, other than Olive Garden, grew sales. Olive Garden sales were slightly lower due to disproportionate impact Olive Garden experienced from the significant increase in COVID cases. This is because Olive Garden's geographic footprint and guest demographics make it more sensitive to COVID case counts. Additionally, Olive Garden continues to have significantly less marketing and promotional activity, which is a headwind to sales growth when comparing to pre-COVID. The January impact from Omicron I discussed earlier resulted in all of our segments experiencing lower segment profit margin in the quarter relative to pre-COVID.\nFinally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.62 billion driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 30% and approximately 35 new restaurants; capital spending of approximately $425 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, with commodities inflation of approximately 9% and total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%; EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 129 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.45.\nThis outlook implies full year EBITDA margin growth versus pre COVID of roughly 200 basis points, still within our previous expected range. This outlook also implies fourth quarter sales between $2.52 billion and $2.59 billion and EPS between $2.13 and $2.28, which is higher than what was contemplated in the previous outlook we provided in December. As Gene said, our quarter-to-date average weekly sales are slightly ahead of February, and that is incorporated in this guidance.\nLooking forward to fiscal 2023, we're providing some preliminary guidance for a few items. We expect to open approximately 60 new units in fiscal 2023. We project total capital spending between $500 million and $550 million. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 14% for fiscal 2023.\nNow I'll turn it back to Gene.\n\nEugene I. Lee\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\nThanks, Raj. This morning marks my 31st and final earnings call in my years leading Darden. So all the analysts who support us, thank you for believing us, our vision and our ability to execute. And for those of you who didn't always believe in us, thank you as well. You motivated me more than you will ever know. I want to thank our shareholders for the trust they have shown us and by investing in Darden. I will miss our time together, whether it's a one-on-one meeting, a group meeting or one of the many dinners we shared over the year. And finally, thank you to all the team members in our restaurants and our support center for the lifeblood of our company. I look forward to seeing you in our restaurants in my new role as Chair.\nI began this journey 45 years ago as a high school kid busting table. I've learned a lot of lessons throughout my career, but 2 in particular have served as guiding principles for me. First, when it comes to making decisions, you have to make sure both your guests and team members win. When those 2 critical stakeholders win, it's a good decision.\nSecond, this is a simple business. [Malcolm] said it best. The restaurant business is simple, but simple is heart. To be successful in the restaurant industry, you must have great people who consistently serve outstanding food and an engaging atmosphere. So I may have bored you with my back-to-basics operating philosophy, running great restaurants will always require intense focus on the fundamentals. As I transition into my new role as Chair, I'm confident Darden is set up for success. Rick is ready to lead the company, and he and his team will do a great job.\nNow we'll open it up for questions.",

This conference will be recorded.\n\nAt the end of the presentations, you will have the opportunity of asking questions. Should you need the support of an operator, please press\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Oliver Kyle.\n\nallow me to welcome you on behalf of our CEO Rans Dommermud and our CFO Markus Huhn for the presentation of financials 2021 and the forecasts for 2022.\n\nThe board will present the financials and forecast in the context of this meeting.\n\nconference and explain the forecast for 2022. As usual, we will be available for your questions after the presentation. Thank you very much. May I give the floor to Mr. Damamud now?\n\nGood morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference. I'll start with the company development 2021 and will give you a short status update on our 5G network development and then Mr. Hoon will give you the financials for 2021 and the forecast for 2022. The company development is as follows.\n\nOur digital business is broken down into broadband and mobile phone. For broadband, we are the largest alternative DSL provider in Germany, serving 4.24 million broadband connections. We offer VDSL and fiber-to-the-home complete packages, including voice, IPTV from a single source via one-on-one versatile.\n\npartner company provides the last mile, either Deutsche Telekom or City Carriers.\n\nWe are doing fairly well in our services. We have won Connect's landline test several times.\n\nin mobile phone services, where Germany's leading MVNO provider with 11.9 million mobile service contracts.\n\nWe offer this as our primary brand, 1&1, as well as our co-brands, GMX and WebDE, and the discount brands, which we own together with Drillish AG. Again, we have good quality here in terms of customer satisfaction.\n\nwere awarded the first place by Connect in 2021.\n\nThe customer contracts last year developed positively, we were able to conclude.\n\nan additional 600,000 contracts, a total of $15.43 million by now. Growth was driven by mobile internet with 670,000 new connections. With broadband lines, we have a slight decrease of...\n\nRevenue last year increased by 3.2% to €3.9 billion.\n\nincluding a 3.123 billion euro worth of service revenue, which represents a growth of 3.4%. On top of that, other revenue, which is usually low margin revenue, particularly smartphones.\n\noffer to our customers with subsidized rates and that are paid back in the course of the contract period.\n\nWhat's interesting is the EBITDA by segments, we make a distinction between our access business, which is our current business, and the buildup of our 5G network. If we take a look at the access segment, we were able to.\n\nincrease the EBITDA operatively to 709 million euro. Why operatively? Well in 2021 we had an out of period\n\nvalue which is actually from 2020 and in 2020 we had a once-off.\n\nvolume, and if we adjust this, we can see that our operative EBITDA has been increased by 8.9%. I think that is a significant increase, 8.9%.\n\nat 3.4% growth of service revenue. I think that shows that.\n\nhandled our customer base very well and are very good in upselling.\n\nConcerning the buildup of 5G, i.e. our own mobile phone network, we had higher expenditures than in 2020, 37.9 million Euro in 2021 compared to 13.9 last year.\n\npage shows a summary of growth of customer contracts plus 4 percent, revenue increased by 3.2 percent, as I mentioned, the EBITDA.\n\nuh... adjusted for out of period and one so\n\nvalues growth by 5.3 percent to 671 million and\n\ntake out the cost of the build-up of our network, we actually had an increase of 8%, 5%.\n\ngenerate any business yet. The operative EBIT...\n\nAnd similarly to EBITDA, increasing by 5.2% to 570.3 million EPS, operative again has increased to 1.94 up from 1.92.\n\nwill suggest to the annual general meeting in our\n\n22 to payouts, five cents per voting share.\n\nYou know that we are subject to the 5G.\n\nAct, we expect significant investments this year into the 5G network, which is why we would like to keep the money in the company right now.\n\nAnd that takes us to the buildup of our 5G network. Let me give you the status overview in 20...\n\n19 were able to acquire\n\nfrequencies at 3.6 and 2.1 gigahertz. We are also renting frequencies from Telefonica at 2.6 gigahertz.\n\nThis will run until the end of 2025 when we will have our own frequencies available. We were also able to make an agreement with\n\nTelefonica last year. We also have created or closed a general contract agreement with Rakuten and were able to agree on the leasing of antenna sites from Vantage Towers.\n\nWe are now in the process of building up the network with a one-on-one, versatile partner organization that builds fiber optic network, connecting decentralized...\n\nAt the same time, the antenna locations are being set up. We are mostly relying on co-location, so we want to extend existing locations.\n\nand we are building core and edge data centers. This is ongoing right now and we think, as you can see on the next slide.\n\nThe next, the first 1,000 antenna locations will be commissioned by the end of 2022.\n\nthus meeting our rollout obligations. We're also cooperating, we're negotiating with further tower companies for additional co-location locations.\n\nnegotiating with partners to build new antenna sites because we won't be able to cover the entire network with co-location sites.\n\nwhether we will retain these.\n\nantennas or whether we will sell it and lease them, sell them and lease them back has not yet been decided. It's also an important milestone is the acquisition of the 800 megahertz frequencies, which is being discussed in Germany, how this should be auctioned.\n\nFor us, it is important that this be discrimination-free so that we have a fair chance of acquiring frequencies. We was.\n\nauction at the beginning of 2024, but this is out of our control. This is going to be decided by the Federal Network Agency. So, what is established, if you catch your minds back, we didn't even have the national roaming contract within the Telefonica last year. We didn't have an agreement with Rakuten as a general contractor. We had no agreement with Vantage Towers or with 101 Versatil. All of that has been done by now. Our team is growing.\n\nWe're building our own team that is responsible for the buildup of the network.\n\nSo we're quite optimistic that things will pan out as planned. Well, thank you very much for your attention, and I'll give the floor to Mr. Hoon.\n\nThank you, Mr. Damoud, and good morning from my behalf as well.\n\nI'd like to take you through the financial figures on the next pages of the past financial year. I want to start with the revenue situation on page 14. Mr. Dhammamud has already mentioned the turnover and the cost of sales have been...\n\ndropped to 2.7 million, which is a drop of 6%. The result has increased to 199 million, which is a plus of 32.6%. These two positions reflect the effects that Mr. Dhammamud has mentioned earlier on.\n\nwhich is the hundred and twenty nine\n\nmillion off in 2021 and the 39.4\n\nmillion of off-period results. If we adjust these two positions, the operative turnover costs would be increased by 1.4% and the gross results...\n\nwould have been increased by 8%, so this is a very nice development compared to the service turnover as well. The sales costs have increased to 467, the distribution costs, which is an increase of 34.2%.\n\nAnd these are the higher costs for sponsoring and marketing.\n\nuh... administration's cost where one hundred and twenty six point one million which is an increase of twenty six point seven percent and these includes the initial uh... numbers of our five-g mobile network uh... this is also the reason for the high increase five-g cost twenty four million euros alone so uh... that the increase in the administration cost for only two point seven million euros\n\nuh... the other financial realm\n\ncosts have been dropped by 27.8 million and the assets to minus 78.4. The result of the operative activities was 146.7 million euros. The financial result at minus 11.6 includes expenses for the investment to the 5G covering white spots.\n\nWhen we acquired the frequencies in 2019, we had an agreement with the...\n\nministry which meant that the payment was postponed over the next 12 years and then on the contrary we\n\nagreed to invest 50 million into the covering of white spots and that will be levered by the financial results and that ends up to 11 million euros and without that we would have been.\n\ncoming out at the same level as the year before. The tax profit before taxes was 535 million point 1. The tax expenses 165 point 1 million euros so that we had a consolidated result of 370 million euros.\n\nOn the next page you see the balance sheet, the sum with $7,063,700, an increase of $365,000 compared to the year before. On the active side, on the asset side, we see that by the short-term assets, which have increased by $340,000,000.\n\nThe rest is from free liquid means because of the financial agreement with United Internet. The short-term liabilities have increased by 81.5 million euros, which is mainly due to the application of the reverse charge proceedings by invoicing communication services. That means the service that we provide are invoiced without.\n\nVAT and we pay that VAT directly to the financial tax office and that means we have short-term liabilities.\n\nfor that respect. The long-term liabilities have been dropped by €73.5 million. That is because of the payment for the frequencies. In 2019, the asset capital has been increased by €370 million.\n\nOn the next page, you see the cash flow calculation, the net cash in payment.\n\nin 2021 was 432 million euros after 450.7 in the year before. The main reason for this drop was\n\nbased on the upfront payment for the new VDSL contigent contract in 2021 and that was about 200 million euros.\n\nOn the other side, we had expenses from this payment which were resolved so that at the bottom line, the end is 126.3 million in accuracy.\n\nand the result was 360.6 million which is 37.2 million CAPEX and 313 investment of free cash at United Internet. The cash flow from financing activities with 81.2 is at the level of before comprising of dividend payments 8.8, leasing liabilities with 11.6 and repayment of spectrum liabilities of 61.3 million euros so that in the result we have a free cash flow of...\n\n349.8 after 243.7 in the year before.\n\nOn page 17 you see the development of the operative EBTA to the free cash flow.\n\n€671.9 million is the operative EBTA and in addition we have the €39.4 million of period revenues leading us to the EBTA of €711.3 million.\n\nThat is reduced by the build-up of the contract assets and liabilities due to our growing customer base. This position grows by 48.7 million. And then we have the accrued expenses, which is the balance of the down payment for the VDSL contract minus the payment made for that of 126.3 million euros.\n\nThe result from reliabilities of related companies is positive with 25.4 million.\n\nThe other working capital is negative with 8.2 million euros and the taxes result to minus 121.5 million euros and the cap at the mentioned minus 37.2 million so that we end up with a free cash flow of 349.8 million euros.\n\nLooking at the forecast for the next year, 2022, our service revenue is planned with a\n\nPlus, for 2022, $2.3 billion after $3.1 billion in 2021, the EBGA will be kept.\n\non previously at level at 672 million euros. This includes 70 million starting up costs for the 5G network in the past business year.\n\nThis was 38 million euros and the operatives of Flavagrove is expected to be a plus of 650,000 contract after about 600,000 plus in 2021.\n\nresult will be reduced by\n\nof period effects from the TKG adjustment of a minus of 200,000 contracts and the CAPEX is affected to 400 million euros roughly after 37 million in the year before. These are mainly driven by investment into the build-up of the 5G mobile network.\n\nmainly in the first year investments in computers, software and platforms which are necessary to operate that network, and of course in the extension of the sites and investments into antennas.\n\nSo with that, I'll hand back over to the operator and we are ready to take in your questions.\n\nThank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we can now start with the question and answer round. If you wish to ask a question, please press your telephone keys 0 and 1. We will then give you the possibility of asking your question one after the other.\n\nIf you want to retract your question, please press 02.\n\nIf you are using a loudspeaker today, please make your question via your telephone.\n\nThe first question comes from Willie Cotton, Jefferies.\n\nWell, I would like to start with two questions. The first one pertains to customer growth, which is mentioned.\n\nthat you expect 650,000 operative additional customers.\n\n200,000 shifts from the Telecommunications Act.\n\nI have two questions of content. Why is this effect so high for one-on-one? Other operators have indicated this pressure, but you can't really lose them all if there's only a shift. So why is that a relatively high negative effect that you're expecting at one-on-one? And then I found that this is not included in the annual report. Why is this not included in the annual report and is only shown on this slide?\n\nconcerning the network project. Progress seems to be a bit slowed down. Topic...\n\nadditional contracts for further antenna towers, then soft start with a thousand locations to replace your broadband business by the end of the year. Should we understand this such that you are procrastinating the whole project a bit until you find out about the details of the 800 megahertz?\n\nThere is no assurance of a continuation of the broadband business for one and one.\n\nWell, concerning the first question, customer growth, I don't know what the effects with the competitors will be. What we've seen, the competitors haven't given any details so far. For our side, we can only say that...\n\nNotices that we're receiving on contracts. We don't see more customers leaving us but\n\nin the past under the previous legislation customers\n\nwere receiving up to 12 months worth of services before the notice became effective under the\n\nnew act so the customer can leave the contract within a month so that the notice is effective much faster and we forecast that this will have an effect on 200,000 contracts this year.\n\nThe question on why is not given in the business report, I think it is shown in the letter of the board on page 8 of the report.\n\nconcerning the extension of a network, the buildup of a network. It's not true.\n\nprocrastinating the build-up because there's uncertainty concerning 800 megahertz frequencies.\n\nWe are in the process of taking all preliminary steps.\n\nuh... started their work there on schedule they have reached all the milestones that we have prepared so intro including uh... ventures uh... durations where\n\nin order to build the antennas, it's all on track.\n\nThe negotiations with the other tolerant companies took a bit longer than we had originally expected. The negotiations turned out to be more complex than we had expected, but we're, again, quite optimistic that we will be able to get a good result.\n\na contract result. No deliberate procrastination, but more effort and complexity involved than we would have expected a few weeks ago. But on the other hand...\n\nwhere we were able to conclude contracts. We have made good progress in operative implementation.\n\nOh, may I? Sorry, let me add to that.\n\nWhy are we starting in two stages? Well, we don't have national roaming initially. And initially, we have no function for cell handover. And this is.\n\nYou can put a Wi-Fi router or a cube into your home and use it to place your phone calls. That's the first step. And once that is up and running...\n\ncreating the mobility function and in the summer of 2013\n\nwill start national roaming and then there will be a short period of stability where we only allow new customers to connect and then some weeks later.\n\nWe will conclude with the final steps, moving existing customers. That means...\n\nthat will have to port nearly 12 million phone numbers. That will be a period of about two years before all customers have been migrated to the new network. That's the schedule, the timeline. Concerning the 800 megahertz frequencies...\n\nI said that I'm sure that there will be no simple extension. Why?\n\nWell, because these frequencies have to be allocated discrimination-free. And that's what I hear everywhere. That allocation of these frequencies will take the new entrant into custody.\n\nI don't know what the upshot will be, but I'm sure that it won't be just a straightforward extension.\n\nVodafone, Telefónica get their licenses extended, that's not what's going to happen.\n\nThe next question is Jonas Blum for Port Richard, your line is open.\n\nThank you. I have three questions as well. First of all concerning wholesale, could you give us a status update on the negotiation with Freenet and is there any restrictions with respect to Telefonica Germany? The second question is tower companies. Could you remind us how many players you are negotiating with and to what extent?\n\nwhat that could be with respect to further additional sites and the question concerned to that is there a capex risk if you don't close any more negotiations and the question the third question is a comment of Mr. Ruhemann from a Bundesnetzagentur in FHZ I think\n\nsaying that a mandatory moment would be considerable for the extension of the 800 MHz.\n\nlicenses and for Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom the question would that be a possible solution to win a second player for roaming for\n\nOkay, let me start with the wholesale negotiations. As to now, we have no concrete negotiations ongoing with that respect. We have to set up our network, and then we can start thinking of that. What is stopping us now is the national roaming agreements with Telefonica, because as of today, that prohibits wholesale, and as the mobile...\n\nservices have to be offered across all Germany. That means a tariff is always the share of our share and the roaming share from Telefonica. That makes it impossible for us to...\n\nnow sell our offer by third parties with the third parties\n\nuh... having the customers and uh... doing that what we can do a spandex reselling which is moralist standard procedures of today if you look at all the today for example uh... you're not doing a contract with all the usual contract with telephonic up that is what we are allowed to do as long as we are the contract partner that is okay but as of today we are not\n\nallowed to combine the wholesale, the national roaming services.\n\nwith our own services, which is Freenet with Mogul.com DBTEL, and we can't offer that.\n\nBut that is something where we have different opinions with respect to Telefonica, and we'll have to settle that difference of opinion with Telefonica. The different tower companies, we are in negotiations with two companies, or in discussion rather, which is about collocation for a couple of thousands of sites, I think we're looking at.\n\n4,000 possible additional sites here beyond the ones that we have from Vantage already. And it is clear that if these discussions don't lead to success or we can only win one of these partners, we will not be able to build these sites and co-locations and we'll have to build new sites.\n\ninstead, and the CapEx risk is given if the new site will be held by us in the long run. What has become customary in the past years from the Anglo-Saxon area\n\nuh... but i had to stop being taken over by many telcos in uh... Europe that they built right and directly seldom at least come back\n\nAnd these are offers that we have available, and we tend to go down that path as well. I don't think we are going to have passive infrastructure in...\n\nform of antenna in our portfolio in the long run. But I can't promise that as of today. As of today, we are not expecting any CAPEX risk. And a site, no matter whether it's a co-location, when it's not ours, or we build it, sell it, and lease it back, that state will not be, that site will not be on our balance sheet. And you asked also about a quote.\n\nwhere he said that Vodafone and Telecom\n\nobliged to do roaming in the auctioning of the frequencies. Of course, I can't comment on that very well.\n\nBecause I didn't say it, Mr. Homann said it, but what I imagine is that in the case that they say there is a mandatory roaming, that of course that cannot only be mandatory for Telefonica alone. They can't audit them, auction them, and if Telefonica gets them, they have to do national roaming, and if Vodafone or Telekom get them,\n\nAnd the question is, of course, even if that were the case...\n\nIf you think it all the way down the line, if you can exclude us, why shouldn't we not auction a free coin and offer a national roaming to another partner? We could do just as well as Vodafone or Telefonica could.\n\nSo in that respect, I am quite relaxed.\n\nThis has to be free of discrimination and...\n\nThe regulations, whatever may apply then, is up to the federal offices to decide.\n\nThank you. Can I just ask again on the tower companies, which had to be additionally put on by third parties, would that have a...\n\nsignificant difference in costs from what the offer is now.\n\nIt always depends on the site, there are more expensive and less expensive ones.\n\nAs far as we see it, as of today, that is not going to be a significant difference.\n\nThe next question is by Martin Hammerschmidt. Your line is open. Well, thank you very much. I would like to get back to the first...\n\nWhy is that not a zero-sum game for the entire industry? If everybody loses customers, they have to migrate somewhere.\n\nAnd one-on-one has a solid...\n\nnetworks, why is that not a net benefit for one-on-one? That's the first question. The second question is...\n\nYou said that the tower negotiations turned out a bit more complex than expected.\n\nWhat part is so complex, is it the pricing, the locations, or maybe other?\n\nIn your interview with Weltansamt, Amsontag newspaper, you spoke of 5 billion that need to be invested over the next few years.\n\nYou have the various components, Rakuten, Vantage, one of them Versatil.\n\nCan you give an approximate split of what you expect in OPIX and CAPEX, or is that not yet possible? Thank you.\n\nwith the impact of the new Telecommunications Act.\n\ncustomers with a minimum contract uh... length of twenty four months\n\nused to go into an extension, an automatic extension of the contract.\n\nwith a uh... notice period of three months uh... so we had to pay an extension of contract periods by three to twelve months now they can uh... give notice within uh...\n\none month and your question is if you if your customers go away you should\n\nGain new customers as well Well, the fact is that we don't see all our notices here our customers leaving us But only a part of it\n\nAnd this is due to the fact that some customers have already made a new contract along the other one, the old one, to continue. So if a customer, for instance...\n\nwants to buy a new mobile phone, still has an old customer running for another five months.\n\nuh... they made a new contract to get the phone and uh... let the other one run that's not necessary anymore now they can give notice now within a month and that is the effect we're anticipating we will see this effect for a twelve month period after that it will have balanced out and these twelve months\n\nwill see the strongest effect in the first quarter, then less in the second quarter, less even in the third quarter, and least of all in the fourth quarter because it overlaps. Customers who anticipate notes notice.\n\nuh... don't have an impact in the uh... second third or fourth quarter where they would have had it in the past customers who anticipated to the second quarter won't have an impact on the third and fourth quarter anymore so this wave kind of will flat notes uh... over the over time so we have the highest uh...\n\npeak in the first quarter, then less in the second, less in the third, and at least in the fourth quarter. That's our forecast. Now, if we...\n\nEnded the business now then it would develop in the other direction because then\n\nwhen we normally would discontinue this business, we'd have X amount of contracts if we discontinued the business overnight. Then at the end of the day, we'd have as many.\n\nnotices to issue, as we have now. Concerning the second question, the tar companies, why is it more complex? Well,\n\nAnd such a contract has hundreds of pages plus attachments.\n\nand a lot of detail is covered by uh... those contract because you have\n\nmake rules for a long-term cooperation running for 20 years with extension options in our case.\n\nAnd this forecast of what will be 20 years from now, how will prices have developed by then?\n\nand how will they develop in any extension period and\n\nCan we simply use straightforward price increase mechanisms, or do we have to have a fundamental adjustment somewhere along the line? And what happens if this fundamental adjustment makes it unattractive for one side or the other? That makes it very complex. So that's my experience from these negotiations, and those are the main issues.\n\nwe're dealing with here because where we have a very long-term outlook and don't make a contract for the next uh... couple of years uh... we want to be happy with\n\nAnd of course, the other side has the same outlook, their infrastructure providers.\n\nAnd so those are complex negotiations.\n\nAnd that, just like with any other problem, there will be solutions for this one as well. And that we'll find them over the next few weeks. I'm really optimistic here.\n\nwas what's the breakdown of the five billion in OPEX and CAPEX in the interview I'd said.\n\nIf I add up what we've already spent on frequencies and add what we've ordered in terms of hardware,\n\nIt takes us to fiber optic hardware.\n\nIf we look at what we've already ordered for the next few years, it all has to be delivered, then this tops up to $5 billion.\n\nnot be CAPEX out of it. Of course, the antennas are CAPEX. We own them. The equipment of the data centers is CAPEX. It belongs to one-on-one, but the shell of the data center is not CAPEX.\n\nThat is made available by one-on-one versatile, or the fiber optic cable is made available by third parties. Locations are made available by Vantage, and so they're opaques for us.\n\nBut I can't give you an exact breakdown now. We will be happy to do that when we've.\n\nfinalized everything, when we've made the contracts that are still missing, when we've auctioned or acquired the frequencies that we still lack, then we can tell you what our business will develop over, how our business will develop.\n\nWe have another question from Ulrich Ata, Geoffrey. Your line is open.\n\nThank you for allowing me to ask again three shorter questions. The first one, could you...\n\nDetail on the drop of landline customers\n\nIs that just out of focus, because the focus is on mobile?\n\nCommunications and that is why this is\n\nor is that something that you want to address again more strongly in 2022? Another point is the capex level of 400 billion euros, which is at least above the market expectation when it was announced.\n\nWould you go as far as saying that as the start-up level?\n\nand you should expect something lower in the years to come or would you go to as far as to say how much the startup cost or the ramp of costs would be from these 400 and first question is inflation\n\nSpecifically on the Advantage Tower IPO, here the company declared that the MSS, and I think Vodafone,\n\nhave a 2% inflation cap, I think, so wherever inflation may be, it will never be above 2% in the contract.\n\nDo you have that in your contract as well with Vantage and maybe in the overall picture could you at this point in time...\n\ncomment on the expectations of inflation and how that is going to affect your business case with respect, for example, to energy costs and other aspects as well. Thank you.\n\nBefore Mr. Huynh comments on the CAPEX question, I would like...\n\nConcerning the contract with Vantage Towers is just something we cannot publish any details on because it is\n\nNot possible to disclose it, but I would be happy if you ask Vantage.\n\non the regulations that we have made with respect to price developments, but without the agreement of our partners, I wouldn't want to talk about that, breaching possible confidentiality. And the draft of the landline contracts...\n\nlandline business is good business for us because\n\nwe can increase turnover and profit every year despite a dropping number of customers.\n\nof course we are not happy that we are losing customers even if it's only a small number we are of course up to grow in this area as well to do that we\n\nto drop the prices and intensify marketing and sales.\n\nto do that for, in inverted commas, old or transitional technologies because at the moment we are mainly offering ADSL and VDSL and that is why we decided not to go over the line in these old technologies.\n\nin terms of investments, but rather turn towards new technologies. We are more and more able to offer FTTH. We have just finalized a contract with Telecom in the past few weeks, and we are starting to work that market from that perspective now. And that is where we see the future in the next couple of years, where we are more open to do more investment while the ADSL and VDSL\n\nis rather something that we'll, of course, carry on with, but...\n\nas good as possible as Bell, but not to put more load balance on the telecom net, the Versatel net, has a high utilization rate anyway, and the telecom network is something that we have to pay customer by customer, and we have no pressure there at all. Why should we invest into marketing, lower the prices with all the effect in the customer . . .\n\nto keep ADSL and VDSL up, which will drop and decline over the years anyway, and against that background, we want to move to FTTH as this is growing continuously.\n\nincrease marketing and sales there as well. We want to learn how to work in that business and then we'll see.\n\nthat it will balance hopefully and the customer losses that we have in ADSL that's where we are losing the customers while VDSL is slightly growing still where we then could be able to compensate these loss of customers by FTTH and the futures that's where we need to see the future and that's where we want to invest.\n\nAnd coming to the question on the CapEx, I mentioned earlier the 400 million euros include a larger sum for the initial ramping up and equipment of the Core Data Center, including the platforms and the necessary software which is needed to operate that kind of network.\n\nIn the next year there is going to be investments as well but these are going to be lower than 2022 and the investment sum that we are forecasting for next year is going to be lower than what we are planning for 2022.\n\nSo, I'll try to answer the question in this way. The market has a consensus of what direction, what range the investments can move in, and that is what we have been planning and expecting for next year as well.\n\nThe next question comes from Dan Watts, Aventus Participations. Thank you very much.\n\nconcerning these 1000 antenna sites that you want to have by the end of 2022, how many sites do you have already? How many locations or are there any locations already?\n\nYes, we have some locations, we have test operations.\n\nrunning already on different locations, but that's a handful only, and we...\n\nunder full steam in order to develop the other locations, the co-locations to get this done by the end of the year.\n\nAnd that is what our contracts with our partners are designed to achieve.\n\nWe are following up on this very closely. We're on track everywhere with Vantage, Recruit, and 101 Versatile. And if this continues, then we will manage to achieve our first target.\n\nWe'll see that we started late in the game.\n\nWe had the frequency acquisition in 2019.\n\nAnd we would have liked to start in 2019, as you know.\n\nWe're able to conclude National Roman Catholic Phonica in May 2021.\n\nstart operating a network without national roaming because\n\nYou're not allowed to be a network operator and MVNO provider at the same time, which is right.\n\nand we have more than 11 million customers we have to cater to.\n\nAnd we had no option to say, oh, well, we'll just start operating.\n\nbecause that very day we would have had to start migrating our customers to our national network and without national roaming we wouldn't have had any customers at the end of the day. And so for us\n\nThat was an important moment, this national roaming agreement.\n\nAnd finally, concluded in 2021, you know that the real option...\n\nin our MBA contract with Telefonica that we drew that in 2018. It took us two and a half years to negotiate the terms.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, the EU supported us in terms of pricing so that we were then able to make a conclusion.\n\nconclude the contract. And, of course, we would have loved to do this quicker. Now, it is what it is. We have to step on it and achieve to develop our network, this first stage of our network.\n\nIt's 25% of our budgets by the end of 2025 and 50% of our budget to 2030.\n\nWe hope that we can achieve the next stages much faster, that is at least the plan.\n\npreparation time for these targets. The 1,000 antennas, that'll be a tight schedule, no doubt. But what it's really a\n\nbe relevant for our business, we will be able to handle this very easily as planned in our business plan. Yes. Thank you. Maybe another question following up on this. What happens if you don't manage to achieve the first 1,000 antennas because you can justify that very well?\n\nIf you don't achieve the 1,000 antennas by the end of the year, would that be still acceptable?\n\nwell i can't say anything about that that's a decision by the federal network agency uh... i expect that we can achieve this target by the end of the year so i never thought about what happens if we don't\n\nI don't have to speak about the overall political situation.\n\nsupply chains, etc, etc. You know more about that than I do. I can't give you a rock-solid commitment now, but I can tell you that we are on track with our...\n\nplan to achieve these 1,000 antennas. We've reached all the milestones in good time.\n\nSo I have no reason to believe that we will not achieve the next milestones, and that's why I'm quite optimistic that we'll make it in time with 1,000 antennas. And we report on a regular basis to the Federal Network Agency, so we are in constant dialogue with the agency on our network extension, on the milestones we have, the contracts we've concluded.\n\nWe don't do that on a monthly basis, but maybe it is on a monthly basis, actually, that we actually give a...\n\nuh... extensive report to the uh... the federal network agency they have a one one hundred percent transparency uh... concerning our contracts are milestones everything\n\nHello, Miss Moore, Oliver Kyle. I'd like to go to the English room to see if there are questions. Yes, that's okay. There are no more questions from the German room, so we'll switch over to the English room.\n\nAnd just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press zero and one on your telephone.\n\nAnd the next question is from Polo Tang, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two questions. So the first question is really just clarification in terms of network build cost.\n\nSo if you come back to the 5 billion euro figure that was mentioned previously, can I clarify if this includes any OPEX or is it just a CapEx number? And can you clarify over what time frame this 5 billion euros is being spent?\n\nDoes it include any costs for the 800 MHz spectrum?\n\nAlso, just to focus on CapEx, if you exclude spend in terms of CapEx on the core network and CapEx on data centers, can you give us a rough idea in terms of what we should expect in terms of CapEx per cell site and also how should we think about the OpEx per cell site?\n\nSo that's the first bucket of questions. And my second question is really just about the broadband market.\n\nCan you maybe just comment a bit more about the competitive dynamics in terms of what you're seeing with the German broadband market? So only Deutsche Telekom appears to be seeing growth, so do you think the market is mature? And also, how do you think about future growth in your broadband business? Is it more about growing ARPU and people trading up to faster speeds?\n\nOr do you think you can kind of also grow by adding subscribers?\n\nYes, let me start with a second question.\n\nin our customer base, we do see a good development as far as the APO is concerned, which is growing. And as I've just said, we want to carry on with that. In particular, with the.\n\nelderly technologies, ADSL, VDSL, we don't want to see any drops in the customer base. We have competitors that offer at lower prices than we do.\n\nVodafone and Telefonica are less expensive than we are. Telecom...\n\noffers roughly at our offer at our level if you order a telecom online and that's our only sales channel we have more or less the same terms and conditions as we do offer so in this point we are not very low priced but\n\nWe develop our base. We want to concentrate, however, on the newly starting business of Fibre to the home.\n\nand in the past we have been working with city networks but the footprint was\n\nOverseeable and now telecom is starting and until end of 25 I think they want to reach 25 million households and Maybe it was 20 million. I don't\n\nme for that, but by that, we have much more marketing opportunity with these new technologies, and that's a business that we were lacking of before, and that is why we do assume that with the customer drop in the old technologies, in particular ADSL, we're going to see a growth in FDHH, and that will balance it off.\n\nWe'll have to see how that develops, how long that will take, but that is our rough strategy as a whole, despite of the drop in customers in the broadband business, we had higher turnovers and revenues in the last year than in the year before.\n\nCAPEX expenses that we see in the 5G context, we had named the 5 billion figure. These include the payment\n\nobligations for the contract from the next year. This also includes the frequencies which are in the auction 2019. The expenses for the 800 megahertz frequencies are not included here.\n\nthe CAPEX and OPEX is concerned in detail, we cannot yet comment.\n\ntoo much. We'll be able to do that when we can make the business case transparent as a whole. For this year, we have guided the 400 million CapEx.\n\nand of course this includes larger components of core of platforms which are initial and which will not repeat in the next year in this dimension so that is why we expect CapEx in 23 to be below the level of 24 22.\n\nand the components that we find in the CAPEX, Mr. Dhammamud has mentioned these before, I think, that is the antenna, which are going to be effective on the CAPEX, as well as computers and software that will be installed in the data centers. The data centers themselves will be rented from Versatel, as well as the fibers and the infrastructure from the TAR companies.\n\nThe next question is from Joshua Mills, BNP Paribas exam. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\n\nHi guys, thanks for the questions. I'm going to ask a couple. So I guess to put it in context, it's been...\n\njust over three years since you first bought Mobile Spectrum and we haven't had any detailed financial guidance on EBITDA, free cash flow, return to targets, for the financial markets to assess whether you building a network is a value-creating or value-destructive event. And I know that today had initially been planned to be a capital markets day. So my question is...\n\nwhen will you provide us with those financial details? Do you plan to provide them at all?\n\nbecause what sounds like you're saying is the tower code\n\ndiscussions have delayed things but you also made the point that it might be more difficult to give guidance until we have the 800 megahertz spectrum auction which as things stand won't happen until 2024. So my question is should we expect within the next 12 months to get a clearer guide on what the cost EBITDA, CAPEX and free cash flow implications of you building a network will be?\n\nAnd then the second question, more simply is, I know there's been a couple of one-off payments to Telefonica Deutschland and adjustments which they've reported, and I think you've also talked about in the past, should we expect any one-off payments to Telefonica Deutschland in 2022? Thank you.\n\nwith the transparency concerning the build-up of the network. We have a business plan. So far, with what we've ordered or bought already, we are...\n\nknow that with Vantage we've agreed 3,800 to 5,000 antenna locations of 12,500. Now we need to cover the missing locations. I said earlier that we're working on it, that it takes a bit longer than anticipated to conclude the negotiation.\n\nAnd once we've done that, we'll have a better overview of how the business.\n\nWhat we still lack are the 800 megahertz frequencies because they will only be auctioned to market in 2024.\n\nI think we can give you an overview of where we stand without these 800 megahertz frequencies.\n\nIf we, once we have the\n\nuh... agreements of the contracts on uh... the uh... power uh... at that time\n\nOnce we've determined whether we will build additional antennas and then sell them and lease them back, we will decide about that in the next few months, and then we can give you an overview. But that will be subject to the proposal that this may change with the acquisition of the 800 MHz frequencies. But, as I said earlier in the interview with Valdemar Zontag in the newspaper last Sunday,\n\nI indicated that our case hinges on the fact that...\n\nnot be more expensive in terms of our production.\n\nAfter a short few years, then we now purchase them. So we should move into a phase very soon.\n\nsubsequently where we actually will be more profitable than now because we don't only have the network costs that we need to take a look at but also on the other hand we have significant savings\n\ndon't have to purchase our own produced capacities externally anymore and we will be able to give more detail on that.\n\nOnce we have an overview of how we will proceed with the antenna locations, and then we will be able to model this quite precisely with the exception of the 800 MHz frequencies, we'll be happy to do that.\n\nConcerning the question on the contract with Telefonica whether this\n\na result in a one-off payment in 2021. That is not the case. There will be no one-off prepayments anticipated by the.\n\nThank you. If I could ask one follow-up, sorry, on the network coverage. So the press article talks about five billion costs over the next few years.\n\nSo my question is, does the $5 billion cost get you to just the 25% coverage, which you have to meet by 2025?\n\nOr does the $5 billion cost get you all the way to the 50% coverage which you need by 2030? I'm just getting back to Polo's question here. $5 billion is a lot of money. It really matters whether it's being spent over the next three to four years or over the next 10. So if you could do some numbers around that, it'd be helpful.\n\nWell, this figure is to give you a general idea of what we've already spent or ordered by now.\n\nWe look at covering 50% of households.\n\nBut this will not be, this figure will not be sufficient to reach this.\n\nWhat the exact volume will be, we can discuss once we have contracts.\n\nAs we will place the orders for 20 years with Vantage, for instance, we have a contract running for 20 years.\n\nFor example, we have to rent the data centers, the fiber optic cable, et cetera. They're all long-term contracts. And these long-term contracts will be juxtaposed to revenue as well.\n\nwe won't be able to make do on 5 billion euro for the next 20 years, that'll be more of course.\n\nAnd the next question is from James Ratzer, New Street Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So there are two specific questions, please. Just going back to the path for tower build out.\n\nCould you just run through again how you see yourself at the moment or the options to get to the 12,000 sites I believe you've talked about in the past. If I take your comments earlier, I think you were saying you've got up to 5,000 with Vantage Towers. You mentioned you might be in discussions with another third party about another 4,000 co-locations.\n\nIf I understood that correctly, that would then take you to 9,000. What would be the bridge for the last 3,000? Would that be 3,000 built to suit...\n\ncontracts. It would just be helpful to kind of run through that and also an expected timetable on when you think you might be able to announce some of those transactions.\n\nAnd secondly, please, going back to the impact of the new telecoms law, I think you mentioned it could have an impact for around 200,000 customers. Could you just help us to quantify what the impact is on service revenues?\n\nfrom this change, is it actually extremely limited or is it more material and therefore the underlying service revenue growth you're guiding for this year is an acceleration from 2021? Thank you.\n\nThe agreement with Vantage covers 3,800 sites and can be extended up to 5,000 sites.\n\nTalk to the two tower companies that we are discussing with in the way we imagine it and that would work out. We would look at another 4,000 sites.\n\nAnd you are quite right, on the way to 12,600 there are some sites missing.\n\nI'll say that will be a magnitude of about 5,000, which will be built suit.\n\nAnd whether it's really 5,000 exactly or 7,000 will depend on how we deal it out with the telcos.\n\nIn summer, we will be able to give you a more clear picture in this respect.\n\nMaybe quicker, but I don't want to from my hat out too far here. We have no pressure that we have to sign any contract. Now we are working with Vantage. Currently, we'll have to get the first thousand sites up. But we don't have to cover all twelve thousand six hundred now.\n\nAnd in this respect, like with everything else, there is a good contract with...\n\nwill prevail over speed in concluding it.\n\nSo this is why I would like to ask you for a little more patience and my impression is that we'll have a better picture in summer time, but please don't name it down to it. As I said, we have no pressure to sign these things fast. For us, it's important to...\n\nIlluminate our different options Vantage is our prime vendor in this and from that we will move on\n\nAnd with respect to the question on the early leaving or terminations of customers due to the GTG law on the service, yes, it does have an effect on the service, but we don't see that as material.\n\nIn that respect, we don't see them having an effect on our guidance. With the $3.2 billion, we are still quite comfortable.\n\nBut just to check, thank you for that, just to check, I mean, are you able to give any idea on how...\n\nJames, can you repeat, please? I've heard that you want to check something, but the later part of your sentence, we weren't able to listen to.\n\nOh, yes. Okay. Sorry about that. Yes. So the 2nd part, which is, are you able to give any quantification of what that impact is on service revenues? Please.\n\nThe impact range is 10 to 15 million euros.\n\nThe next question is from Adam Fox Rumley, HSBC. Your line is now open.\n\nThank you very much. I've got a couple of questions please. Firstly, I was wondering if you could talk about 70 million of losses this year. Are you paying all the contractors that you've announced at this stage already? Is there any way that you can help us think about how those scale up over time?\n\nThe second question was on the contribution to the white spot build. I know it was a fairly small number in Q4, but should that quarterly number annualize? Is it 40 million a year that you're contributing there, or is it less than that?\n\nAnd then finally, we've got a question on depreciation. Last, in the article at the weekend, Mr. Donald pointed to fixed wireless access by the year end on those 1,000 sites. Does that trigger the amortization of the spectrum to start? Thank you very much.\n\nYes, concerning the question\n\nThe use of the 5G expenditure, the $70 million this year, are driven by the beginning of the rollout.\n\nWe have initial expenditures for fiber optic connections now.\n\nthat are necessary to operate the data centers and also for the build-up of the organization to operate the network. Last year the expenditure was largely driven by the preparation by negotiations for the\n\nSo this position is now growing together with the extension, the build-up of the network. Concerning the white spots, these 11 million euro...\n\nthat we're showing in our financial results for this year.\n\nwill be deferred over the period. So in the first year, we have the highest expenditure at 11 million euro. Then in the subsequent years, the financial expenditure from this position will.\n\nDepreciation for frequencies will start once we start operating the network.\n\nSo once we start migrating the customers, which will happen in the second half of 2020.\n\nOkay, thank you for those clarifications. Can I just ask, are there any payments to Rakuten in that 17 million? Thank you.\n\nThe $70 million, of course, include expenditures influenced by Rakuten.\n\nThe next question is from Mr. Bluestone Credit, which your line is now open.",
    "content2": "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'll keep it to one question, please. I just had a question about the 200,000 subscriber impact that you flagged from the new telecoms law. I think the new telecoms law became effective in December , so I guess this would have impacted Q4 a bit already. Your net ads looked broadly fairly stable, so.\n\nCould you maybe comment on what was the impact that you saw in the sort of first month, so in Q4, from the new telecoms law? And maybe if you can just give a little bit of color around, does this mostly impact you on mobile or fixed? Obviously, I appreciate there's a difference in size of the customer bases, but where do you see the headwind to the proportionately hitting most?\n\nAlso, because we have more mobile customers and\n\nIn the last year we couldn't see any impact because the new law was enforced.\n\nenacted in the 1st of December .\n\nand that would, in 1st of December and with that one month termination notice, customers couldn't terminate their contracts last year.\n\nRight. I guess maybe if I can ask a follow-up, and sorry, it's obviously hard to comment on competitors, but we saw a sizable impact at Vodafone, but not for you. Are you able to comment on why it didn't impact you, but it did impact them? Is there something different in terms of how the contract...\n\nWe can't answer that question, unfortunately. We can't know why it had an impact with Vodafone. As Mr. Dommamood has explained, the customer could have terminated at the earliest point.\n\n1st of December at a four-week notice, so the effect can only take place in 2022. Got it.\n\nThe next question is from Ms. Vangazi-Bornberg. Your line is now open.\n\nHello, thank you for the opportunity. I've just got two questions please. The first question was just on the\n\nBased on your discussions that you're having with the Tahoe Coast, is there any scenario that you can foresee when you might be able to get to coverage of 12,500 sites as early as –\n\n2025 or 2026. I just want to test whether that is a\n\nwhether that is even a realistic scenario or not.\n\nAnd then the second question was around the new agreement with Deutsche Telekom.\n\nwhere, you know, clearly it seems to be that the...\n\neconomics of selling the higher speed packages is better, you get to pay lower overage charges.\n\nSo this is – and I guess selling IPTV is also more economical now with the new contract. So just in that context, are you planning to be more active on the high-speed tiers and with IPTV than you have been in the past? Thank you. Well, thank you very much.\n\nand how fast the\n\nbuild-up speed will be with build-to-suit sites will be, so we can't tell today.\n\nif we can get a certain number of additional co-locations.\n\none or several partners who are quite competent.\n\nthen it is theoretically possible to finish this within five or six years, four or five years, but we can't comment on this today because we're not at the point where we know.\n\nconcerning the uh... economic viability of the new telecom contract that we concluded at the end of last year in principle the economic viability of\n\ngross margin that we achieve with this customer is at the same level as the old contract but what we can see is a shift towards\n\nAlso, the demand for a terrace with wide bandwidth.\n\nUm is increasing has been increasing for years. So we are now focusing on\n\nthese uh... white uh... broadband uh...\n\nand that is why we've had a slight decrease in our contracts over the last couple of years.\n\nuh... an increase in sales volumes because uh... the a p o is increasing because uh... cost\n\nAnd then the, are you actively selling IPTV at the moment with broadband? Or is this something that is planned for future? Thank you.\n\nis always offered with our agreements, with our contracts.

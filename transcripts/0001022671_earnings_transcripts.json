Sir, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Elie. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics' Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently.\nSuch statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions.\nExamples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet, at www.sec.gov and, if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results.\nAnd now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thank you, David. Well, good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us on our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Some may suggest hyperbole, but I often said that we have the best teams on the planet and they proved it once again in the third quarter.\nOperationally, they executed incredibly well while keeping each other safe, and achieve pivotal successes in furthering our significant growth projects. Financially, even with some interim market headwinds in flat roll, we achieve a number of key operational milestones. We had a record steel shipments of 3.6 million tons. Revenues were $4.8 billion, adjusted EBITDA was $664 million, and we had a healthy cash flow from operations of $723 million. At Sinton, we believe consistent operational execution has been achieved.\nIt was a record quarter for shipments, downstream coating and prepaint product quality has matured, and the value-add product portfolio is expanding nicely. Industry participants are recognizing that this is the middle of the future. Our Linen team continues to make strong progress in commissioning and ramping operations, receiving a number of quality certifications in September and October.\nIn particular, our can sheet has been performing extremely well with equivalent results to competitive material. Much more to do, but incredibly exciting performance today. In our biocarbon team shipped their first product in September. We're extremely excited to have this new tool in our decarbonization journey that will further reduce our carbon footprint from an already industry-leading low level.\nI continue to be proud of the entire Steel Dynamics team because they are just the foundation of our company, and they continue to amaze me. And so we're laser-focused on providing the very best for their health and safety. It is an everyday conversation at every level. Our world-class safety culture continues to mature and our team's dedication to our tape controller safety program is extraordinary and continues to produce strong results.\nTheir commitment is inspiring. They consider themselves family and challenge the status quo each day to keep you other safe. But that said, there will always be more to do as we drive toward a 0 incident environment as there is nothing more important for us.\nSo with that, I'll hand it to Theresa and to Barry to give some color to the quarter.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and thanks to the team for an exceptional performance. Our third quarter 2025 earnings per diluted share were $2.74 with adjusted EBITDA of $664 million. Both third quarter 2025 revenue of $4.8 billion and operating income of $508 million were higher than the second quarter results driven by record steel shipments and metal spread expansion as scrap raw material costs declined more than steel prices.\nAs we discuss our business this morning, we continue to focus and execute on our transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated operating income of $498 million in the third quarter, 30% higher sequentially based on record shipments, supported by an almost 20% improvement in shipments from Sinton and metal spread expansion.\nAverage scrap costs declined $27 per ton, while average realized pricing only declined $15 per ton. For modeling purposes, this quarter's hot band shipments were 1,097 000 tons. Cold-rolled shipments were 120,000 tons; and finally, coated shipments were 1,486,000 tons. Additionally, we also highlight that our 3 flat-rolled steel production divisions have planned maintenance outages in the fourth quarter, which could reduce volume by as much as 85,000 tons.\nFor the third quarter, operating income from our mills recycling operations was $32 million, significantly above our sequential second quarter results driven by near-record shipments supported by domestic steel demand and study nonferrous volume coupled with metal spread expansion. We're the largest North American metals recycling processing ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals, and we're growing to support our increased steel capacity and aluminum flat-rolled operations through new and expanded supplier relationships and through the use of innovative separation technologies.\nOur metals recycling platform is a significant competitive advantage for all of our platforms. Our steel fabrication team achieved operating income of $107 million in the third quarter, 15% higher than second quarter sequential results due to increased volume, coupled with relatively flat metal spread. Our [ joists ] and deck backlog extends through the first quarter of 2026 with solid pricing. And federal programs, manufacturing growth and onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and therefore, related steel joist index consumption in the coming years.\nCongratulations to the aluminum teams in Columbus and San Luis Potosi, hitting so many early quality milestones, the energy and momentum are contagious. Related startup operating losses of $57 million were somewhat higher in the third quarter than previously expected as the team's continued construction and commissioning of various areas while also accelerating testing for beverage can and automotive products.\nWe currently estimate comparative losses to be in the range of $40 million for the fourth quarter of 2025. Based on current expectations, we continue to believe our aluminum operations will achieve monthly EBITDA breakeven or better in the fourth quarter of this year. During the third quarter of 2025, as Mark mentioned, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $723 million, of that, operational working capital was a funding source of $126 million.\nWe ended September with liquidity of over $2.2 billion. For the fourth quarter of 2025, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $200 million and early estimates for capital expenditures for the full year 2026 are in the range of $500 million to $600 million.\nDuring 2025, we've repurchased $661 million of our common stock or 3.4% of our outstanding shares. At September 30, $1 billion remained available for share repurchases. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 223% and we've repurchased $7.4 billion of our common stock. That's over 40% of our outstanding shares, all while maintaining investment-grade ratings and growing.\nThese actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nOur free cash flow profile has fundamentally increased over the last 5 years to $3 billion, excluding our large strategic Sinton and aluminum investments. We've truly placed ourselves in a position of strength. To have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns.\nWe recently announced that each of our company's steel mills achieved global steel Climate Council product certifications. For our customers, this means greater transparency and confidence when sourcing lower and body carbon steel products from us.\nAnd I'm incredibly proud and excited to announce that our biocarbon solution team safely produced and shipped their first biocarbon material in September and it was successfully used as a carbon replacement at our Columbus Flat Rolled Steel division, providing an even lower carbon supply chain for our steel customers in the future.\nThe team plans to continue to refine operations and increase production into the first quarter of next year. This achievement marks a pivotal SEP in our decarbonization journey and verse demonstrates our ability to translate innovative concepts into tangible results, a personal thank you to all 73 biocarbon team members. Decarbonization is a meaningful part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment.\nWe are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We uniquely have an actual path forward that's intentional and manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our peers. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Thank you. Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations improved their sequential results as volumes increased 12% sequentially, more than offsetting slight metal spread compression. Order activity remained steady in the quarter, and our backlog now extends through the first quarter of 2026.\nPricing for steel joist and deck bookings remained relatively stable throughout the quarter. We continue to be optimistic for our Steel [indiscernible] platform based on the continued onshoring of manufacturing, continued announcements of significant privately funded manufacturing projects and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs.\nThe long-term uplift of this backdrop could be considerable for all of our platforms. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, critical and softer demand environments allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the impact of lower steel prices.\nEarnings for our metals recycling operations were much higher in the third quarter as metal spreads improved and shipments were at near record levels. We believe [ fares ] scrap prices have stabilized and are likely to remain relatively steady throughout the rest of the year, aside from typical seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, the team continues to expand its access to recycled aluminum for our aluminum flat-rolled operations.\nNorth American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel, aluminum and copper operations and for our scrap generating customers. Our metals recycling team partners closely with our metals production and manufacturing teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through advanced process and technology solutions.\nThis collaboration helps mitigate supply risk by making more grades of ferrous and nonferrous scrap usable for operating platforms and generally at a lower cost. Additionally, it positions us to significantly increase the recycled content in our products, unlocking enhanced earnings capabilities.\nThe steel team delivered a solid quarter with record shipments of 3.6 million tons. In the third quarter of 2025, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78%, while our steel mills operated at a notably higher rate of 88%. This consistently higher utilization reflects our value-added steel product diversification, differentiated customer supply chain solutions and strong support from our internal manufacturing businesses.\nOur elevated through-cycle utilization rate is a key competitive advantage, underpinning our growing cash generation capability. Overall realized steel pricing slightly declined in the quarter due to lower flat-rolled steel pricing tied to lagging contracts, which more than offset increasing structural and railroad rail pricing.\nOverall, domestic steel inventories remain lean from a historical basis. However, coated flat-rolled steel volume and pricing compressed during the quarter due to an inventory overhang related to imports received earlier in the year prior to the positive related trade rolling. We do believe that prices have bottomed out and will improve as we head into 2026.\nLast month, the ITC unanimously voted affirmatively on the final determination that imports of corrosion-resistant steel from 10 countries injured the U.S. steel industry. This uniquely positions us as we are the largest producer of nonautomotive coated flat-rolled steel products in North America.\nTogether with the announced Section 232 steel tariffs, these developments are expected to positively impact demand for lower carbon emission U.S.-produced steel products. The underlying steel demand remains steady, However, customers continue to exercise caution in placing orders to ongoing changes in trade policies.\nThat said, we believe steel prices have stabilized in the near term with potential for upward movement in 2026. Our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill achieved higher earnings in the third quarter, driven by record shipments and the continued efficiency and quality gains. Congratulations to the team.\nThe team continues to make improvements in yield cost reduction and quality. They are also continuing towards additional product development to expand our current flat-rolled steel capabilities. Meaningful progress has been made on unique high-quality API pipe grades, high-strength grade 10 110, pressure vessel quality and OEM qualification packages for our automotive customers.\nWe are seeing increased shipments from SIM's value-added coating lines which are strengthening the facilities product mix and boosting its through-cycle earnings capabilities. Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2026 were recently revised modestly upward yet currently remain modestly below 2025 forecast.\nFortunately, our specific automotive customer base has not only remained stable but have provided opportunities for growth. We have become a supplier of choice for many U.S.-based European and Asian automotive producers due to our superior carbon content capabilities. Additionally, numerous announcements have been made concerning a considerable volume of automotive production moving to the U.S. from foreign locations in the coming years.\nWe continue to grow market share in both flat-rolled and SBQ steels within the automotive sector. Nonresidential construction should benefit from ongoing onshoring activity, recently announced domestic manufacturing projects and continued infrastructure spending that are expected to further support fixed asset investment construction-related demand.\nIn the energy sector, oil and gas activity remains steady, with solar continuing to be very strong as producers adapt to benefit from expiring incentives. Overall, we remain extremely optimistic concerning steel demand and pricing dynamics for the domestic producers in the coming years based on the expected demand from new manufacturing and U.S.-produced steel content requirements.\nWith that, I'll return it to Mark Millet.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. [indiscernible] I appreciate that. Thank you, Theresa. So after many years, I think it's clearly evident that our performance-driven team-based culture in combination with a proven, diversified and value-added business model drive superior financial metrics.\nThis consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a very balanced cash allocation strategy that has delivered the highest shareholder returns, not only among our metals peers for the best of domestic manufacturers.\nOur disciplined investment approach continues to support a strong and growing cash generation profile while maintaining a best-in-class return on invested capital. Our aluminum investments are now a reality and are extremely compelling. Initial operations and commercial activity are confirming our initial investment premise.\nWe believe we will enjoy a unique commercial position. Unlike our entry into the oversupplied steel market some years ago, there's a significant domestic supply deficit of over 1.4 million tons for aluminum sheet. And this deficit is forecasted to grow even before tariffs. In 2024, that deficit was supplied through high-cost imports, which are now at an even higher cost as the tariffs increased from 10% from 24% to the current 50% level.\nThere's a clear alignment with many of SDI's core competencies. Our construction capabilities have been once again proven. Both Columbus and SLP are state-of-the-art assets. And if you just think about it for a second, we shipped our first coil within 24 months of groundbreaking.\nAnd here we stand today, 27 months from groundbreaking and we're shipping a prime product to the can sheet in automotive markets. That's an absolutely incredible, incredible performance. My hats off to the team down there to Glen pushes into Greg Wigan everyone for making that happen. It's an absolutely beautiful, beautiful facility, work of art.\nWe also lever our deep operational know-how, have an extensive and successful experience operating melting, casting rolling type assets. And our performance-driven culture will drive higher efficiency and lower cost operations, just as we did when we entered the steel industry some 30-plus years ago. It's demonstrated and the teams will achieve.\nWe have an advantaged commercial position. 2/3 of our carbon flat rolled steel customers also consume and process aluminum flat rolled sheet. Our growth and penetration into the automotive sector will complement our existing steel position and give customers product optionality. The countercyclical beverage can market which, in conjunction with the more stable earnings profile experienced through the use within the aluminum space will further enhance the consistency of our through-cycle cash generation.\nOur own material platform will facilitate higher recycled content. We are the largest North American metal recycle, including aluminum, we recycle already around about GBP 0.5 billion of [ linen ] per year. And we've successfully developed new separation technologies, allowing us to have both more access to usable aluminum scrap at a lower cost.\nOperational experience thus far is confirming our earnings differentiation. We've advertised and do believe that through-cycle EBITDA of $650 million to $700 million is absolutely achievable, plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for our omni operations.\nThe key areas of advantage remain labor efficiency, higher recycled content, higher yield and optimize logistics along with our low-cost culture. There is no doubt the strategic investment is a cost-effective and high return growth opportunity, providing SDI with additional [indiscernible] diversification further stabilizing and growing our cash generation capabilities.\nAnd for those that have been there, you understand it. The 650,000 metric ton [indiscernible] is no longer a vision. It's clearly here. As our aluminum growth has become a reality and our reputation permeates the industry, aluminum professionals with vast experience have joined us in this excelling project. They see the vision and are energized by our culture where they realize that they will be heard and can have a real impact.\nThey have helped us build a phenomenal team that combines in-depth knowledge of aluminum flat-roll operations, commercial markets, process technology and custom service complementing our SDI professionals that bring our performance-driven entrepreneurial culture. We're finding the customer base is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-focused and responsive to their needs.\nFor us, as in with steel, business relationships are long term founded on trust and the continuous goal of creating mutual value, not simply financial value, for new supply chain solutions, new products, better quality and better service. We are seen to react with surprising speed. Many customers have just seen that with the recent supply side challenges in the market.\nThe timing of our ramp-up has been fortuitous, allowing us to help the market while accelerating our material qualification. We received approvals for industrial and can sheet finished products and for automotive aluminum hot band earlier this month. This accelerated certification should allow us to shift our product mix to a higher-margin mix in 2026, reaching optimization sometime in 2017.\nThree of the 4 melt [ casthouses ] are fully commissioned at Columbus and have produced 3,000 5,000 6,000 series ingots for the industrial, can sheet and automotive sectors for rolling mill commissioning product development and commercial shipment. The hot mill is completing its commissioning, having run 3003 and 5052 industrial, 3104 can [indiscernible] and 754 auto grade material.\nThe code reversing mill is in startup and is successfully producing 3003, 5052 and 3104 alloys. Tandem mill #1 will be starting up in November and then Tandem mill #2 and the cash line are on schedule to be available in the first quarter of 2026 and it's absolutely incredible if you walk through the plan because the team is incredibly excited with the earlier-than-anticipated product certification.\nIt is a testament to the phenomenal talent that we have on the team and is great energy, great momentum. We anticipate exiting 2026 at a rate of 75% capability, and we expect to achieve monthly EBITDA breakeven sometime in the fourth quarter and increasing thereafter as we continue to ramp and optimize our product mix.\nAcross our business, evolving market dynamics provide an opportunity for us to further enhance our earnings potential. The renewed focus on strategic mercantilist policies to ensure fair and sustainable competition will further improve market strength. The recent coated flat-rolled steel positive trade determination will further curb core and prepaying imports. We're seeing that already. The administration will continue to hold a firm position on tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\nAnd the inclusion of tariffs on steel content or derivative products, including fabricated structural steel, which has played the domestic industry for years will be substantial benefit. One has to consider that in '24 some 30 million to 35 million ton of steel came in through actual products. And then last year, obviously, the successful sunset reviews of Section 201 and 301 trade cases will remain in place for some years, stopping dumped Chinese steel for accessing our markets.\nWe will benefit from growing fixed asset investment, which correlates directly with increased steel demand. Risk mitigation to address numerous supply chain dislocations as accelerated reshoring of manufacturing by many OEMs. I AI and cloud computing will support the need for more nonresidential construction, along with data centers, chip factories and battery plants.\nWe believe that obviously will be associated positive stimulus through the inevitable interest rate reductions that should happen this year and the next. And finally, decarbonization. We're materially steepen the global cost curve providing steel dynamics with a meaningful competitive advantage to gain market share and increase margins. More importantly, we continue to be in passion by our current and future growth plans.\nAs they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. Capital spending for symptom, the 4 value add lines and alum Dynamics is largely spent for the projected future through-cycle EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion.\nSteel Dynamics has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business of scale and diversification, driven by the best teams, as I already said, in the world. The model has now demonstrated itself year after year. delivering financial metrics equivalent to best-in-class manufacturing companies. We are fortunate and at the heart of that good fortune are our people.\nThey are the foundation of everything we do, and I want to personally thank each of them for their passion, their commitment and unwavering dedication. And we are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority, always. And I would also be remiss not to express my gratitude to our loyal customers, many of whom have been with us since the beginning.\nThese partnerships are built on mutual trust keeping our word and delivering innovative solutions that enhance your value. Our new aluminum partners can expect the same level of commitment and collaboration and to our suppliers and service providers thank you. We value your continued support and the strong relationships we've built together.\nOur culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance, leading best-in-class financial performance. and as a circular metals business, we are uniquely positioned to offer lower carbon supply chain solutions, enhancing sustainability while helping to mitigate cash flow volatility through all market cycles.\nThis positions us to deliver superior shareholder returns and create lasting value for all stakeholders. So we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us and today and in the years ahead. And with that said, Elie, we would love to open the line for questions."

Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our second quarter 2025 earnings call. As evident in our release, our teams achieved a solid second quarter performance, and most fulfilling to me was the team's overall safety performance. They achieved an all-time low quarterly recordable and lost time injury rates. In fact, 80% of our over 100 locations didn't even have a single recordable injury. It's a supreme achievement by the team. My sincere thanks to everyone involved.\nAlthough experiencing some challenges in the second quarter relating to vendor oxygen supply that inhibited steel production, the Sinton team continued their progress. They increased sequential earnings achieving pretax breakeven and another positive EBITDA quarter. We expect a steep acceleration of profitability for the remainder of this year and next. We believe we have reached an earnings inflection point for steel fabrication with expectations for increased profitability in the third quarter.\nWe achieved record quarterly metals recycling shipments -- adjusted EBITDA was $533 million. Biocarbon is in the midst of commissioning with expectations for product shipments to begin later in the third quarter. We were awarded the Volkswagen Global Group Award for Sustainability is a testament to our low carbon steel program and its associated impact on us becoming the supplier of choice for auto groups expanding in the U.S.\nAnd aluminum is here. We shipped our first commercial quality aluminum flat rolled coils on June 16. So congratulations to absolutely everyone involved in the phenomenal progress. So we are successfully executing on many fronts, and I'm proud of the entire Steel Dynamics team. There's no doubt the other foundation of our company and remain our first and foremost priority.\nAs such, we are focused on providing the very best for their health and safety. We're building a world-class safety culture. Our team's dedication to our tape controller safety program is absolutely extraordinary and resulted in the record metrics this quarter. Continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They consider themselves family and challenge the status quo each and every day. With that said, there will always be more to do as we strive for a 0 incident environment.\nSo with that introduction, Teresa, some sales on the quarter.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our second quarter 2025 net income was $299 million or $2.01 per diluted share. which -- with adjusted EBITDA of $533 million. Second quarter 2025 revenue of $4.6 billion was above sequential first quarter results due to higher realized steel pricing across the platform.\nOur second quarter operating income of $383 million was 39% higher than the first quarter results, driven by steel metal spread expansion as pricing increased more than scrap raw material costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to focus and execute on our transformational growth initiatives.\nOur steel operations generated operating income of $382 million in the second quarter, over 65% higher sequentially due to average realized pricing increasing $136 to $1,134 per ton, while total shipments were modestly lower due to a decline in flat rolled shipments.\nEarnings from the steel platform were reduced in the second quarter by approximately $32 million due to a noncash write-off of consumable assets. They were also negatively impacted as seen shipments were reduced by approximately 55,000 tons due to a reduced vendor supply of oxygen, which has since been restored.\nFor those -- for modeling purposes for shipments in the second quarter, hot rolled shipments were 930,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments were 114,000 tons and finally, coated shipments were 1,387,000 tons. For the second quarter, operating income from our med recycling operations was $21 million or $4 million lower than sequential first quarter results, due to lower realized ferrous pricing as primes were down about $50 per ton and other grades $80 per ton.\nThe price differential more than offset the team's record shipments. We are already the largest North American metals recycler for ferrous and nonferrous metals and we're growing in support of our increased steel capacity and aluminum flat-roll operations through new and expanded supplier relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies. Our melt recycling platform is a significant competitive advantage for our steel, aluminum and copper operations.\nOur steel fabrication team achieved operating income of $93 million in the second quarter lower than first quarter results as realized pricing declined modestly and steel substrate cost increase compressing margins. Federal programs, manufacturing growth and onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel and steel joist and deck consumption in the coming years.\nAs for our aluminum operations, I also want to send a huge congratulations to the team on their first shipment. It truly is an exceptional accomplishment. Operating losses from the aluminum operations totaled $69 million in the first half of 2025. We estimate comparative losses to be in the range of $40 million for the third quarter of 2025, which is consistent with second quarter results, then improving to between $15 million and $20 million for the fourth quarter as we complete commissioning, commenced product certifications and ramp production.\nBased on current dynamics, we continue to believe we will achieve monthly EBITDA positive results before the end of 2025. Additionally, in connection with startup, we will stop capitalizing interest expense associated with the aluminum project. As such, we estimate interest expense to increase to about $30 million in the coming third quarter and to the full $45 million in the fourth quarter.\nRelated to cash flow, during the second quarter of 2025, we generated cash flow from operations of $302 million. Working capital grew $131 million in the quarter as we grew inventories for our new aluminum investments. In June, we repaid our 2.4% $400 million senior note that matured. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $1.9 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $744 million and are fully available unsecured revolver.\nFor the second half of 2025, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $400 million, with the majority related to the completion of our aluminum and biocarbon growth investments. In February, we increased our quarterly cash dividend 9% to $0.50 per common share, continuing our positive dividend profile.\nWe also repurchased $200 million of our common stock in the second quarter representing over 1% of our outstanding shares. At June 30, $1.2 billion remained authorized and available for share repurchases. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation in consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nOur free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to $3 billion, excluding our large strategic Sinton and aluminum investments. We placed ourselves in a position of strength to have sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.\nWe're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. In alignment with the 1.5-degree scenario set forth in the Paris agreement, we have an interim 2030 emissions intensity target, which represents a 15% reduction in our greenhouse gas intensity and a 2050 emissions intensity target. We announced during the second quarter that each of our company's steel mills achieved global steel Climate Council product certification.\nFor our customers, this means greater transparency and confidence when sourcing lower embodied carbon steel products. The GSCC certification verifies emissions data through a certified science-based standard aligned with the Paris agreement. Decarbonization is a meaningful part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment.\nWe're committing to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we grow in our excitement considering our first biocarbon production facility as it transitions from construction to commissioning, with expectations, as Mark mentioned, for production to begin in the coming months.\nWe believe our first facility could decrease our Steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35% and more importantly, provide unique value and supply chain opportunities for many of our OEM flat-rolled steel customers. We uniquely have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you.\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations achieved a solid performance in the second quarter in a somewhat challenging environment, as steel input costs increased and customer hesitancy prevented any meaningful increase in volume. However, order activity remains solid with the order backlog increasing by 15% since the beginning of the year and now extending into 2026.\nPricing for steel joist and deck bookings has remained relatively stable through the first half of the year. Based on the current market environment, we believe we have reached an inflection point in profitability from our fabrication operations and expect third quarter earnings to improve sequentially. We continue to have high expectations for the business based on continued onshoring of manufacturing, recently announced significant privately funded manufacturing projects and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs, the long-term uplift from this backdrop could be considerable for all of our platforms.\nOur steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the impact of lower steel prices.\nEarnings from our metals recycling operations were modestly lower in the second quarter despite record shipments due to lower realized ferrous scrap prices as scrap flows were steady and exports declined. We believe ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and are likely to remain relatively steady throughout the rest of the year, aside from the typical seasonal fluctuations.\nAdditionally, the team continues to expand its access to recycled aluminum in preparation for the ramp-up of our aluminum flat-rolled operations. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers.\nOur Metals Recycling team is also partnering more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through advanced process and technology solutions. This collaboration helps mitigate supply risk by making more grades of ferrous and nonferrous scrap usable for our steel and aluminum production.\nAdditionally, it positions us to significantly increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products, unlocking enhanced earnings opportunities. The steel team delivered a solid quarter with shipments of 3.3 million tons. In the second quarter of 2025, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at a notably higher rate of 85%, this consistently higher utilization reflects our value-added steel product diversification, differentiated customer supplied solutions and strong support from our internal manufacturing businesses.\nOur elevated through-cycle utilization rate is a key competitive advantage, underpinning our growing cash generation capability. Our realized steel pricing increased throughout our product portfolio in the second quarter. And just last week, long products saw additional price improvement. Overall, domestic steel inventories remain lean from a historical basis. However, coated flat-rolled steel volume and pricing compressed during the quarter due to an inventory overhang related to imports that we received just ahead of the final ruling related to the associated industry trade case.\nLast fall, we and other industry participants initiated a trade case related to these products and have since received favorable preliminary countervailing and antidumping rulings. We anticipate final rulings to be determined before the end of September. This uniquely positions us as we are the largest producer of nonautomotive coated flat-rolled steel products in North America.\nTogether with the announced Section 232 steel tariffs, these developments are expected to positively impact demand for lower carbon emission U.S.-produced steel. The underlying steel demand remains steady. However, customers continue to exercise caution in placing orders due to ongoing uncertainty related to trade policies and interest rates. That said, we believe steel prices have stabilized in the near term, with potential for upward movement in the future.\nOur Sinton, Texas flat roll mill achieved higher earnings in the second quarter despite operating a lower utilization rate of 71% due primarily to lack of sufficient oxygen supply caused by a vendor. We believe this impact to our operations could be as much as 55,000 tons. Sufficient oxygen, as Theresa mentioned, has been restored and the bill is operating very well. The team continues to make improvements in yield, cost reduction and quality. They are also continuing towards additional product development to expand our current flat-rolled steel capabilities. Meaningful progress is being made on API pipe grades, high-strength grades, Grade 1 110, pressure vessel quality and OEM qualification packages for our automotive customers.\nWe are seeing increased shipments from SIMs value-added coating lines, which are strengthening the facility's product mix and boosting its through-cycle earnings capabilities. Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2025 were recently revised modestly downward reflecting ongoing uncertainty related to trade discussions. Fortunately, our specific automotive customer base has not only remained stable, but have provided opportunities for growth.\nWe have become a supplier of choice for many U.S.-based European and Asian automotive producers due to our current and planned future superior carbon content capabilities. Additionally, numerous announcements have been made concerning its considerable volume of automotive production moving to the U.S. from foreign locations in the coming years.\nMeanwhile, we continue to grow market share in both flat-rolled and SBQ deals within the sector. Nonresidential construction remained stable despite broader predictions of a potential slowdown. So far this year, construction sector employment and spending have been stable. Pricing for most long products has generally improved, supported by strong backlogs.\nLooking ahead, ongoing onshoring activities, recently announced domestic manufacturing projects and continued infrastructure spending are expected to further support fixed asset investment in construction-related demand. In the energy sector, oil and gas activity remains steady with encouraging signs of increased demand for both flat-rolled and SBQ products heading into the third quarter.\nAdditionally, Solar is particularly strong currently as the producers attempt to benefit from expiring incentives. Overall, we remain extremely optimistic concerning steel demand and pricing dynamics for the domestic producers in the coming years based on the expected demand from new manufacturing and U.S.-produced steel content requirements.\nWith that, I'll return it to Mark Millet.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you Mr. Schneider, I appreciate that. Well, as you've seen these past years, I believe it's more than evident that our performance-driven team-based culture in combination with a proven, diversified and value-add business model drives consistently superior financial metrics. This consistently strong performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has delivered high shareholder returns.\nOur disciplined investment approach continues to support a strong and growing through-cycle cash generation profile while maintaining one of the highest return on invested capital amongst our peers. As mentioned, Sinton did face some action and supply challenges in the quarter, which have since been corrected, then productivity has been reestablished here around about 80% and growing.\nThe facility continues to improve operational reliability, enhance its downstream operations. Despite the hurdles, Sinton increased its EBITDA, as we said, and we expect a meaningful positive shift in its financial performance for the remainder of the year. The 4 flat-rolled steel coating lines are also continuing to increase volume and achieve high-quality standards.\nThese types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. Theresa, I already shared the exciting update for biocarbon. This is an ingrown part of our sustainability program. that is truly differentiating us in the eyes of our customers.\nAs I said, finally, we're incredibly excited to be officially part of the aluminum flat rolled product supply chain. Our aluminum investments are compelling and parallel our entry into then antiquated steel industry over 30 years ago, and there are distinct similarities. An industry with generally older inefficient assets at a considerable cost disadvantage and company's challenge to earn their cost of capital, thereby unable to reinvest in facilities and new technology due to lack of funds.\nSo we believe we have a significant competitive position with aluminum. Unlike our entry into the oversupplied steel market, there is a significant domestic supply deficit of over 1.4 million tonnes for aluminum sheet. And this deficit is forecast to grow. In 2024, that deficit was supplied through high-cost imports, which are now even higher cost as the tariffs increased from 10% in '24 to the current 50% level.\nThere's clear alignment with many of SDI's core competencies of construction and operational know-how. Our ability to build large capital-intensive assets has been proven once again at Columbus. It's a phenomenal facility. That customers are in all our team did a great job. We have a deep experience operating melting, rolling and finishing facilities, our differentiating performance-driven culture will drive higher efficiency and lower cost operations.\nThere's also excellent commercial alignment. 2/3 of our carbon flat rolled steel customers consume and process aluminum flat rolled sheet. We will have both steel and aluminum product offerings, as we gain market share in the automotive sector. And our new penetration into the countercyclical beverage can market sector is a new market for us.\nWe can take great advantage of our raw material platform to drive higher recycled content. As noted by Theresa earlier, we are the largest North American metals recycler, including aluminum, and we developed new separation technologies allowing us to have access to use of all aluminum scrap at lower cost. Feel confident in our earnings differentiation through cycle EBITDA of $650 million to $700 million plus $40 million to $50 million for Omni, as we discussed in the past, the 4 key areas of advantage and labor efficiency, higher recycled content, higher yield and optimize logistics.\nThis strategic investment is a cost-effective and high return growth opportunity, providing SDI with a new product offering and growth platform. And obviously, the project is no longer just a vision, it's here. The customer base is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-focused and responsive to their needs. For us, business relationships are long term, founded on trust and the continuous goal of creating mutual value.\nAs our aluminum growth has become a reality and our reputation permeates the industry, aluminum professionals with the vast experience have joined us in this exciting project. They see the vision and are energized by our culture, where they realize they will be heard and can have an impact. They have helped us build a phenomenal team that combines in-depth knowledge of aluminum flat-rolled aluminum operations commercial markets, process technology and customer service, complementing our SDI professionals that bring our performance-driven entrepreneurial culture.\nConversations with existing and new customers remain robust, as they need and desire new supply options. We have several automotive and beverage can producers that plan to aid us in the product development and rapid product certification as we ramp operations.\nIn the interim, we will be selling a lot of industrial and can sheet products with the expectation to reach our optimized product mix sometime in 2027. Three of our 4 melt cast houses are fully commissioned at Columbus and are producing all 3,000, 5,000 and 6,000 series ingots for industrial, can sheet and automotive sectors.\nThe hot mill and coal mill are in start-up and on schedule and have successfully produced 3,000 series industrial coils. The numerous them streamlines are also in various stages of commissioning and start-up, all on schedule. Based on our current pace, we anticipate exiting 2025 at a utilization rate of between 40% to 50% and exit 2026 at a rate of 75% as product certifications occur.\nWe expect to be EBITDA breakeven to slightly positive before the end of '25 and increasing thereafter as we continue to ramp and optimize our product mix. You have to be there, but there's a real sense of excitement across our company and the plan, driven by a passion to build on our legacy in steel and lead a transformation in the North American aluminum market.\nWe're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have constantly demonstrated. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton with 4 value add lines and aluminum [ Dana ] largely complete with a projected future through-cycle EBITDA contribution from these projects alone of over $1.4 billion. teams has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business of scale and diversification, driven by the best teams in the world. They will maximize opportunity as the industry continues to undergo a paradigm shift, where we have a renewed focus on strategic mercantilist policies to ensure fair and sustainable competition.\nIt's already evident by the recent positive trade determinations for coated flat roll and obviously, all the 232 tariff initiatives on steel and aluminum. And importantly, the inclusion of tariffs on steel content and derivative products particularly fabricated structural steel, which has played the domestic industry for years.\nAnd risk mitigation to address supply chain dislocations as accelerated reshoring of manufacturing. AI and cloud computing will support the need for more nonresidential construction for data centers, chip factories, battery plants, along with growing fixed asset investment associated with public and private dollars.\nDecarbonization itself will materially steepen the global cost curve, providing steel dynamics with a meaningful competitive advantage to gain market share and increase margins. The evolving metals industry landscape provides an opportunity for us to further enhance our earnings potential. As we've said before, we really are blessed in our people on the foundation and fuel of our success.\nI want to personally thank each of them for their passion, commitment and unwavering dedication. And we are committed to them. And I remind us listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and to each other is our highest priority. I'd also be remiss not to express my gratitude to our loyal customers, many of whom have been with us since the beginning. These partnerships are built on mutual trust, keeping our word and delivering innovative solutions that enhance their value.\nOur new aluminum partners can expect the same level of commitment and collaboration. And to our suppliers and service providers, thank you. We value your continued support and the strong relationships we've built together. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial performance.\nAnd as a circular metals business, we're uniquely positioned to offer lower carbon supply chain solutions, enhancing sustainability while helping to mitigate cash flow volatility through all market cycles. This positions us to deliver superior shareholder returns and create lasting value for us all. We look forward to creating even more new opportunities for everyone today and in the years ahead.\nAnd with that said, Holly, we would love to answer the questions of the group."

If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Holly. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the alumina industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports First Quarter 2025 Results.\nAnd now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. It's good to be with you on our first quarter '25 earnings call. I will apologize in advance. I've got a crushing head cold. So if I feel more -- sound a little rugged, please excuse that. But that said, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational performance in the first quarter. It's continued testament, I think, to our business model and performance-driven culture. Highlights included record steel shipments of 3.5 million tons and adjusted EBITDA of $448 million. Most importantly, our teams continue to operate safely. We've been successfully ramping our 4 new value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines with the expectation of full earnings benefit later this year. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification, which further adds to our position of being the largest nonautomotive coater in North America. The [indiscernible] team gained considerable momentum in the quarter running at around 86% of capacity and many times over 90%. The team also achieved positive EBITDA for the quarter with expectations of a steep acceleration of profitability for the remainder of this year. I'm very excited for the accomplishments that the team has made in the last 6 months. And there's absolutely no doubt, it is the middle of the future, and Barry will go into some more detail during his opening comments.\nAluminum Dynamics successfully cast its first aluminum ingot in January at our Columbus, Mississippi facility and in March at our Mexican satellite slab facility. We're extremely proud and excited for the [ teams ], everything is on schedule for the systematic commissioning of the rest of the lines with an expectation to ship commercial quality coils in June.\nAgain, I'm proud of the entire Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they continue to amaze me. We are singly focused on providing the very best for their health and safety, and we continue building a world-class safety culture. In particular, our team's dedication to our take controller safe program is extraordinary. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. I'm continually inspired by the commitment our team members have for one another. They consider themselves family and challenge the status quo each day. That said, there always will be more to do as we drive toward a 0-incident environment.\nSo Theresa, would you like to give us some details on the quarter?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I add my sincere thanks to the teams for another solid performance. Our first quarter 2025 net income was $217 million or $1.44 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $448 million. First quarter 2025 revenue of $4.4 billion was 13% higher than fourth quarter sequential results, primarily driven by record steel shipments. First quarter operating income of $275 million was 16% higher than sequential results, also related to steel volumes. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to focus and execute on our transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated operating income of $230 million in the first quarter sequentially higher as record shipments more than offset metal spread [ contraction ] with an average realized external steel price decline of $13 per ton and an average scrap price increase of $16 per ton. I do want to add my congratulations to the [indiscernible] team. They've really turned a corner, very excited for them.\nFrom a steel price perspective, as a reminder, approximately 75% to 80% of our flat-rolled steel business is tied to lagging contracts, generally, on average, about 2 months in arrears. So the more recent increases in flat-rolled steel pricing will positively impact the second quarter. For modeling purposes for the first quarter of 2025, hot band shipments were [ 1,093,000 ] tons, cold-rolled shipments were 116,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,403,000 tons. And as a reminder, we'll continue to see that coated volume actually increased from a product mix perspective as the 4 new lines start to have full utilization. In the first quarter, they were still only utilized on average around 50% to 55%.\nFor the first quarter, operating income from our metal recycling operations was $26 million improving modestly as volumes in ferrous metal spreads increase. We're the largest nonferrous metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap, nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals and we're growing in support of our increased steel capacity and soon-to-be aluminum flat-rolled operations through new and expanded supplier relationships and the use of innovative new separation technologies. And I want to congratulate the OmniSource and Nano all teams as they're increasing those separation technologies, and we're actually adding capacity in the coming months.\nOur steel fabrication team achieved first quarter operating income of $117 million, lower than sequential fourth quarter results as realized pricing declined a modest 4% and shipments seasonally decreased. Our steel joist and deck demand remained solid with good order activity. March was our strongest order entry month in 2 years. Our backlog extends into the [indiscernible] quarter of 2025 and forward backlog pricing remains solid. Federal programs, manufacturing growth and onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and rated flat and long product steel and steel [indiscernible] in the coming years.\nPivoting to our aluminum operations. A quick reminder as we finish constructing the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A. As a result, our SG&A in the first quarter was higher by approximately $37 million. We continue to have expectations to achieve positive EBITDA in the second half of 2025 for the aluminum platform, and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 30% for the full second half of the year with an exit rate of 50% and 75% for the full year of 2026 with an exit rate of 85%. Construction is coming to completion and commissioning progressing extremely well. Approximately $2.4 billion has already been invested through March of 2025 with the remaining $300 million forthcoming.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, we generated cash flow from operations of $153 million, which was reduced by an annual company-wide profit sharing retirement distribution of $165 million. Excluding this payment, cash flow was $318 million in the quarter with net working capital growing about $105 million as steel prices increased later in the quarter. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.6 billion. We invested $306 million in CapEx during the quarter.\nFor the full year of 2025, we still believe capital investments will be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, with the majority related to the completion of our aluminum and biocarbon strategic growth investments. As a reminder, our sustaining or what some call maintenance capital requirements are conservatively in the range of $200 million to $250 million annually. Regarding shareholder [indiscernible], our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure [indiscernible] and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nOur track record is proven and recognized. In the last 5 years, our average -- excuse me, our after-tax return on invested capital was 23% in this major line frame of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. We opportunistically access the investment-grade bond markets in March and issued $1 billion of unsecured notes comprised of a [ 5.25% ] $600 million 10-year tranche and a 5.75% $400 million 30-year tranche, using the proceeds to pre-fund a $400 million note that matures in June of 2025 and for other corporate purposes. We really appreciate the receptiveness of the credit investors for our offering, allowing us an excellent outcome, and we sincerely thank you to all involved.\nA quick forecasting comment as alumina dynamics and construction, so will the associated interest expense capitalization in the second quarter. So net interest expense in the first quarter was around $12 million. In the second quarter, it will be closer to $3 million and therefore likely $40 million a quarter. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to most recently, $3 billion if we exclude aluminum and Sinton. Even if we include aluminum and sinton, it's still over $2 billion per year.\nWe've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Thank you. Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations had a solid performance in the first quarter. In fact, as Theresa mentioned, March represented the single highest month order entry volume in 2 years with the momentum continuing in April. Our order backlog extends into the fourth quarter with attractive pricing levels. We continue to have high expectations for the business due to the strong quoting and order activity, continued onshoring of manufacturing recently announced significant privately funded manufacturing projects and public funding for the infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs.\nThe long-term uplift from this backdrop could be considerable for all of our platforms. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization and also mitigates the impact of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the first quarter as demand for North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume. The team also continues to grow its access to recycled aluminum in advance of our aluminum flat-rolled operations ramp up. Ferrous scrap prices increased each month of the first quarter of 2025 before moderating approximately $3 per ton in April as weather improved, supporting our scrap flows.\nWe currently expect prices to remain fairly stable throughout the year. The North American geographic footprint of our Metals Recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This helps mitigate potential risk of supply as more grades of ferrous and nonferrous scrap become usable for our steel and aluminum operations.\nIt also provides us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. The steel [indiscernible] managed strong quarter, achieving record shipments of 3.5 million tons. During the first quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at a utilization rate of approximately 75%, while our steel mills operated 89%. We consistently operate at higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics.\nRegarding the flat-rolled steel markets, pricing and order entry have stabilized at levels much higher than we saw in the second half of 2024. However, there has been some hesitation with certain customers awaiting more market certainty. Overall inventories remain historically lean, but increased imports kept incremental buying bay in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat-rolled steel products. We led -- we levied a trade case related to these products in the third quarter of 2024, and we recently received favorable preliminary countervailing and dumping rulings, which has already slowed the imports of a fairly priced coated steel flat-rolled products. This, along with the announced [ 232 ] tariffs, should positively impact demand for lower carbon emission, U.S.-produced steel products. This positions us incredibly well as we are the largest producer of nonautomotive coated flat-rolled steel products in North America. As for the long product steel market, they also improved in the first quarter with demand for most sectors stable or improving.\nPrices have increased over the last several months with solid order entry and improving backlogs. For Sinton, Texas flat-rolled mills production and reliability continue to improve in the first quarter, operating at 86% utilization and at times, over 90%. As Mark said, they achieved positive EBITDA for the quarter. We expect to see significant increase in Seton's earnings contributions as they continue in the second quarter and again in the second half of the year. As the team further improves yield, lowers their cost structure and improves the cost of quality, we also continue to work on product [indiscernible] to expand our existing flat-rolled product offerings. Currently, API pipe grades and high-strength steels are in various stages of development in the operations.\nAlso, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines are increasing volume, improving Sitton's value-added product mix and through cycle earning capabilities. Regarding the steel markets environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2025 recently revised lower with uncertainty due to the impact of recently discussed auto and auto part tariffs. However, there's ongoing discussions of these being softened as well. Fortunately, our specific automotive customer base has remained stable with us growing automotive market share in both flat roll and SBQ steels. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries. However, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen pricing for structural beams, engineered buyers and merchant buyers, increased over the last several months with expanding backlogs.\nAdditionally, onshoring, large recently announced domestic manufacturing projects and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented projects. As for the energy market, oil and gas activity remains steady with recent signs of increasing activity for both flat roll steel and SBQ. We also see ongoing demand in the solar markets, which we are very active.\nLooking forward, we remain optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for the remainder of 2025. And with that, I'll surrender the microphone.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Theresa. Thank you, Barry. Well, I think the last 6 months, a great example of the resiliency of our business model. Our performance-driven team-based culture in combination with a proven, diversified and value-add business model drives superior through-cycle financial metrics. Such consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, having a very balanced cash allocation strategy that has delivered the highest shareholder returns in our industry. Our disciplined investment approach continues to support a strong and growing through-cycle cash generation profile while maintaining the highest return on invested capital among our peers.\nAgain, the [indiscernible] flat rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. As we mentioned, [indiscernible] continues to perfect its operational reliability and downstream operations. They were EBITDA positive in the first quarter with expectations for a material positive shift in financial contribution this year. And most recently, volume and growth strategy is months away from contributing to our earnings. I think the aluminum investment premise is especially compelling and parallels our disruptive entry into steel industry some 30 years ago. We see a market environment in aluminum similar to the domestic steel industry back then.\nOlder assets, high legacy cost burden, inefficient, high-cost operations. They've had a difficulty earning their cost of capital and hence, little additional investment in facilities and technologies taking place. No significant expand in the past 40-plus years. But unlike our entry into the oversupplied steel market back then, there is significant North American supply deficit for aluminum sheet and it's growing. There's clear business alignment between our steel and aluminum operations. We're leveraging SDI's core competencies in construction and operational know-how and exploiting that with our performance-driven culture driving higher efficiency, lowest cost operations. It also levers Omni's recycling footprint being the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler, along with new separation technologies. This meaningful investment is a cost-effective and high return growth and diversification opportunity for us. And the project is no longer just a vision, but it's a reality. Construction of the expansive mill in Columbus, Mississippi is nearing completion and is in commissioning phase being executed at an extraordinary pace.\nThe aluminum industry is finally realizing we're here and we will be a force to be reckoned with. The customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-centric and responsive to their needs. For us, business relationships in long term, founded on trust and the continuous goal of creating mutual value. We strive to be a differentiated supplier each and every day. As our aluminum growth has become a reality, and our reputation permeates the industry, aluminum professionals with vast experience have joined us in this exciting project. And it's exciting to see, they see the vision and are excited by our culture where they see that they themselves can make a major contribution.\nThey are helping us build a phenomenal team that combines in-depth knowledge aluminum flat-roll operations, commercial markets and process technology, [indiscernible] customer service, complementing our SDI professionals that will bring performance-driven culture to bear. As many of you know, the physical assets will be a state-of-the-art 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility in Columbus, Mississippi, with about 300,000 tons of [indiscernible] sheet, 230,000 ton eventually of auto and 130,000 tons of industrial construction products.\nWe will, in Columbus have on-site slab capacity of around 600,000 metric tons, supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap regions. Project scope includes additional scrap processing and new segregation technologies to maximize the aluminum recycled content. The team is executing exceptionally well. The team successfully cast the first industrial [indiscernible] canned and goods in Columbus, Mississippi in January and have since then been developing practices for the 3,000, 5,000 series alloys. And in San Luis Potosi in March, they cast their first thing [indiscernible] also. We plan to continue commissioning throughout the facilities during the coming months and to produce commercially viable products in June 2025.\nProduction is expected to grow to an exit rate capacity of 50% this year and 75% capacity for the full year 2026. This is relative to cost differentiation. We expect through-cycle annual EBITDA of $650 million to $700 million plus $40 million to $50 million for metals recycling platform, significant savings relative to our competition centered on 4 key areas: labor savings, higher recycled content, significant process yield improvements and logistics. And while walking the plant floor, you can feel the excitement as our teams recognize their ability to revolutionize the North American aluminum industry as we did in steel. We're in passion by our current and future growth plans, as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years.\nThe earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. Capital spending for Sinton, the 4 value add lines and the aluminum dynamics facilities is largely spent with a projected future through-cycle EBITDA contribution of some $1.4 billion or more. Fuel dynamics has grown to a resilient cash-generating business and diversification, driven by the best teams in the world. In the last 5 years, we've invested billions of dollars in organic strategic growth. We earned a return on invested capital of 23% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12% and certainly way better than our industrial peers. We've increased our cash dividend over 100%.\nWe have repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares and over 40% since 2017. All the while maintaining best-in-class investment-grade credit metrics and creating outstanding value for our customers and suppliers our teams and our shareholders. I'm excited as investors clearly see now the power and consistency of our through-cycle cash generation, combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy. It is our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism that will provide a level playing field through continued and appropriate trade mechanisms. We've seen that in the recent coated flat road steel positive trade determinations. Recent Trump administration steel and aluminum moves, the tariffs, risk mitigation to address numerous supply chain dislocations of accelerated reshoring and manufacturing. AI and cloud computing will support nonresidential construction, data center data centers, chip factories and battery plants, [indiscernible] growing fixed asset investment associated with public and private dollars, decarbonation agent will materially steepen the global cost curve, providing steel dynamics with a significant competitive advantage to gain market share and increase metal spreads. This evolving metals business environment should amplify our earnings capability. So as you see, we are blessed with good fortune, our people being our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We are committed to them. And I remind us listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each of those is the highest priority.\nI'd be remiss not to thank our loyal customers, many of whom have supported us since our inception. As I said earlier, these partnerships are based on trust on doing what we say we will do and creating new solutions to enhance their value proposition. Our new and aluminum partners were experienced the same and also to our suppliers and service providers who we value and trust. Thank you. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're a circular metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions and in turn, mitigating volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles, providing an enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, I would love to open the lines for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, January 23, 2025, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today.\nLeading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses, as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the internet at www.sec.gov and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q.\nYou will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Fourth Quarter and full year 2024 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us for our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call.\nAs you saw, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational performance in 2024 in what was a challenging market environment, posting best-in-class financial metrics, which is certainly a testament to our business model and performance-driven culture. The highlights, obviously, second highest annual steel shipments of 12.7 million tons, cash from operations of $1.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 billion. And most importantly, we celebrated our safest year ever.\nAdditionally, we've been ramping up our 4 new value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines with the expectation of full earnings benefit in 2025. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification for us.\nThe Sinton team gained considerable momentum in the last 2 months, running above 80% capacity, and they are doing even better in January, with expectations to reach profitability in the coming months and Barry will go into more detail in his comments about the progress and what is yet to come.\nAluminum Dynamics cast its first aluminum ingot 2 weeks ago at our [ Columbus ] facility, and we're extremely proud and excited for the team. Everything is on schedule for a systematic commissioning of the rest of the plant to ensure commercial shipments this June.\nI could not be more proud of the entire Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company. There's no doubt that their passion, innovative spirit and commitment drives our success.\nAs I mentioned, certainly the most gratifying achievement was having a record year in terms of safety. Both our recordable injury and lost time rates were the lowest in our history. We continue to build a world-class safety culture and our team's dedication to our [indiscernible] controller safety program is absolutely extraordinary. The core safety teams visited 85% of our 124 locations in 2024. These teams are made up of our teammates who volunteered to sacrifice time from their families to keep their colleagues safe, and they are truly making it happen. 60% of our locations had zero recordable injuries and 81% had zero lost time incidents last year.\nI'm continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They consider themselves family and changes the status quo each and every day. And even with those phenomenal performance metrics, we certainly have a lot of work to do as we strive toward our zero incident environment goal.\nSo with that introduction, Theresa, would you like to give us your thoughts for the quarter and for the year?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\nAs Mark mentioned, 2024 had its challenges yet the team performed well, and I want to recognize that. In 2024, we achieved operating income of $1.9 billion and net income of $1.5 billion, or $9.84 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion and liquidity remained strong at $2.2 billion, as we continued meaningful organic growth investments and strong shareholder returns. And not to be ignored, our 3-year after-tax return on invested capital was a resilient 23%.\nAs for the fourth quarter of 2024, our net income was $207 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, with adjusted EBITDA of $372 million. As some of you noted, our effective tax rate benefited the quarter approximately $13 million, or 5.4%, due to state adjustments and another 3% benefit related to certain reserve items.\nFourth quarter 2024 revenues were $3.9 billion and operating income was $238 million, lower than sequential third quarter results driven by lower realized steel pricing and seasonal volume. Our steel operations generated operating income of $165 million in the quarter. Sequentially, lower as average pricing declined $48 per ton, while scrap pricing remained relatively flat. Seasonally lower shipments declined 5% in the quarter across the steel platform with a 50,000 ton negative impact at our Butler Flat Roll division related to an unplanned outage.\nFor the full year 2024, operating income from steel operations was $1.6 billion with near-record annual shipments. For your modeling purposes for the quarter, our hot van shipments were 901,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 119,000 tons, and our coated flat-rolled shipments were 1,282,000 tons.\nLikely many of you noticed a reclassification and our supplemental data. In the fourth quarter, we reclassified the financial impact of certain aluminum operations from our metals recycling segment to our new aluminum segment, impacting the associated revenue and operating income lines in our historical data. For context, for 2024, this would have shifted income of approximately $15 million from our metals recycling unit down to aluminum operations.\nFor the fourth quarter, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $23 million as nonferrous metal spreads improved more than offsetting lower seasonal shipments. For the full year of 2024 operating income from our metals recycling operations was $77 million, higher than prior year volume -- higher than prior year results as volume and metal spread improved across the platform.\nWe're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming vera scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other materials. And we are growing in support of our increased steel capacity and soon to be aluminum flat-rolled operations, through new and expanded supplier relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies. I'm really proud of what the metals recycling team is doing.\nAs it relates to steel fabrication, our steel fabrication team achieved fourth quarter operating income of $142 million, lower than sequential third quarter results as realized pricing declined a modest 4% and shipments seasonally decreased. For the full year 2024, earnings from the platform were $667 million, representing a very good year. Our steel joist index demand remains solid with good order activity, and Barry will expound more on that in a minute.\nWe believe that the infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturing growth and onshoring will still increase and support fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel and steel joist consumption in the coming year.\nHeading to our aluminum operations. A quick reminder. As we finish constructing the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. As a result, our SG&A was higher in 2024 by approximately $88 million. We continue to have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for this platform and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 50% in 2025 and 75% in 2026.\nThe construction and commissioning of the rolling mill in the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center are progressing extremely well. Approximately $2.2 billion has already been invested through December 2024, with expectations of funding the remaining $500-plus million in 2025.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $347 million. For the full year, we achieved annual cash flow of $1.8 billion. Working capital in the fourth quarter grew with the improved performance at Sinton and preparation for start-up at our aluminum facilities, which represented an increase generally of around $100 million. In addition to some unexpected increases we had in [ WIP ] and finished goods at some of our long product divisions, which we expect to be rightsized shortly.\nOur cash generation is consistently strong based on a differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $2.2 billion comprised of cash and investments of approximately $1 billion and a fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion.\nDuring 2024, we invested $1.9 billion in capital investments, of which approximately 70% related to construction of our aluminum flat-rolled investments. Approximately $200 million of funding for the aluminum investments shifted from the fourth quarter to 2025 spending. I'd just add as did some other smaller projects throughout the company, increasing our full year capital investment estimate from the original $750 million to $800 million to closer to $1 billion at this point. Again, this is simply a timing shift.\nIn the fourth quarter, we repurchased $295 million of our common stock and $1.2 billion for the year, representing 6% of our outstanding shares. At December 31, we had $194 million remaining authorized for repurchase. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit ratings.\nTrack record [ is ] proven achieving a 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 23%, as I mentioned, bring a period of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years. Our annual average free cash flow used to be around $540 million. Today, in the last 5 years is close to $3 billion.\nWe have placed ourselves in a position of strength to have sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment-grade metrics. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation.\nOn the sustainability front, as we mentioned on the third quarter call, in 2024, we did announce new certified science-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets for our steel mills. They are in alignment with a 1.5-degree set forth in the Paris agreement. We have interim 2030 emissions intensity goals as well as 2050 goals, and we feel very strongly that we can accomplish this. Decarbonization is a meaningful part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment.\nWe uniquely have an actionable path forward that's more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead from many of our industry peers. Our carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. And uniquely, actually, Tricia just let me know last night, we received an award from the corporate -- is that right, Tricia, the corporate nights? And we're one of the world's most sustainable companies. In fact, we're 29th out of 100 companies and we're the only steel company that was mentioned. So I think that's pretty good. And I want to give a congratulations to the teams because we can't do it without them.\nSo with that, Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well throughout 2024, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the first half of 2025. We continue to have high expectations for the business due to positive customer sentiment, high quoting activity, a moderating interest rate environment, continued manufacturing onshoring and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs. The uplift from this macro environment could be considerable for this platform as well as for our steel operations.\nOur steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.\nOur metals recycling operation also performed very well this year, considering the challenge of declining scrap prices through most of 2024. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and [indiscernible] raw material positions. They also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future.\nIt will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. Ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and have increased in January. We expect prices to be moderately high in February as well based on the extreme cold weather through much of the United States and resulting diminished scrap flows.\nThe steel team had another strong year. During 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 86%, excluding Sinton. We consistently operated at higher utilization to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support for our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and the best-in-class financial metrics.\nRegarding the flat-rolled steel markets, pricing stabilized in the fourth quarter and into January. Flat-rolled customer order entry has been seasonally strong to begin 2025. Lead times remain steady and customers remain optimistic on the outlook. Inventories remain historically lean, but increased imports have kept incremental buying at bay in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat-rolled steel products. As most of you know, we [indiscernible] trade case late 2024 and expect to get favorable countervailing and dumping rulings sometime in the next few months, which should significantly decrease these unfairly priced imports.\nLong product steel markets were challenged in the fourth quarter with seasonal weakness across the platform based on customer feedback, the severe weather definitely had an impact as well as cautiousness related to the election outcome and possible administrative moves. We have already seen order activity improvement and expect 2025 to pick up nicely in consumption as we progress through the first half of the year. Based on our railroad rail customers discussions and project activity, we believe we will see increased demand for rail products in 2025, which will further help our product diversification in our Long Products group.\nOur Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel most production reliability improved dramatically beginning in November, exiting the year with a utilization rate over 80%. The team continues to improve with operation levels approaching 90% levels in the last 4 weeks. The team continues working through quality and yield issues that are keeping costs at elevated levels. However, we expect these costs to moderate as we progress through the first half of the year, reaching positive earnings soon. We continue to work on product development with Sinton's capabilities to expand our flat-rolled product offering. Also, the additional two new value-added coating lines are up and running, improving Sinton's operating efficiencies, value-added product mix and through cycle capabilities.\nRegarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2025 were recently revised slightly lower. However, they remain at historically normal levels. Automotive dealer inventories continue to remain below historical norms and actually have declined further in December. The auto fleet in the United States continues to age and has now reached a record high. Our specific automotive customer base has remained strong, and our participation with this space has remained steady and, in some cases, growing. This is for both flat-rolled products and our automotive SBQ customers.\nNonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries. However, we believe moderating interest rates will unlock pent-up project work and create new opportunities as we progress into 2025. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects.\nAs for the energy market, the solar industry continues to grow and be a meaningful market for both our flat-rolled and long products mills. Oil and gas activity remains steady with recent signs of increased activity for both flat-rolled products and [ SBQ ] products. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics as we enter 2025.\nWith that, I'll turn that over.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you Barry. Thank you, Theresa. So I believe it's more than evident that our performance-driven team-based culture in combination with a proven, diversified and value-added business model drives superior through-cycle financial metrics. This consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a very balanced cash allocation strategy that has delivered the highest shareholder returns in our industry.\nOur disciplined investment approach continues to support a strong and growing through-cycle cash generation profile while maintaining the highest return on invested capital of our peers. As mentioned, the 4 value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies.\nAs we mentioned, Sinton continues to improve its operational reliability with expectations for strong production and financial contribution in 2025. And most recently, our aluminum growth strategy is unfolding, and is especially compelling. The ADI investment premise parallels our disruptive entry into the steel industry some 30 years ago. Back then, the market environment was similar to the domestic aluminum environment today, older assets, high legacy costs in efficient high-cost operations. They had a difficult earning -- difficulty earning their cost of capital over the years. Hence, there's been little additional investment in facilities and technology.\nThey have somewhat of an arrogant customer approach and -- but unlike our entry into the oversupplied steel market, there is a significant North American supply deficit for aluminum sheet and it will continue to grow. There's a clear business alignment where we can leverage SDI's core competencies. Our construction know-how is quite persuasive, all you have to do is look at the rate of construction of this project, and it's absolutely remarkable. And we also have operational know-how and our performance-driven culture would drive higher efficiency and lower cost operations than our peers.\nThe project also levers OmniSource's recycling footprint. They're the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler, and they have done a great job here of late developing new separation technologies to separate the various aluminum grades from the scrap stream, particularly the [ 5000 and 6000 ] series from automotive process scrap. This is a meaningful investment, is cost-effective and a high-return growth and diversification opportunity.\nThe project is no longer just a vision but quickly becoming a reality. And as I said, just look at our website. We update that and I think on almost a monthly basis, and just to think that we started digging in the ground July 5 of the year before last, somewhat 18 months ago, is absolutely incredible, the progress to date. Construction of the expansive mill in Columbus, Mississippi, as I said, is at an extraordinary pace. SLP, our slab cast house down there is also proceeding incredibly well and should be operational here in March or April.\nThe future customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-centric and responsive to their needs. And I have to emphasize, after I talk to a bunch of the customers out there, the aluminum customers out there, we will be innovative. We will be incredibly responsive and provide best-in-class service, which will translate directly into customer value. We will be a differentiated supplier.\nConversations with existing and new customers across the markets remain robust as they need and desire new supply options. As we strategically initiated at Sinton, we're developing an on-site industrial park to locate aluminum processing and consuming facilities there. We've already announced one such relationship with [indiscernible], who will help service our automotive customers. And we are currently negotiating a second arrangement that will result in approximately 100,000 metric tons of annual on-site processing capability.\nAs our aluminum growth has become a visible reality, and our reputation permeates the industry, we found aluminum professionals have been signing up to join this exciting project. They're helping us build a phenomenal team that combines in-depth knowledge of aluminum flat roll operations, aluminum commercial markets and process technology, along with customer service, which complements our SDI professionals that will bring our performance-driven culture to [ bear ].\nAs we stated in the in the past, just to recap the facility itself. It's a state-of-the-art plant, 650,000 metric tons of flat-rolled capacity in Columbus, Mississippi. The mix will be around 300,000 metric tons of [ can ] stock, 230,000 metric tons of automotive material, and about 130,000 tons of industrial and construction products. Actually, our Columbus on-site metal slab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons, supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC's scrap ridge regions. The project scope includes additional scrap processing and segregation technologies, as I've already mentioned, to maximize the loan recycled content.\nOur aluminum team is executing exceptionally well. The team successfully cast their first industrial and beverage can ingots on -- cast complex #1 in Columbus this past January 12. And we've had 6 or 7 cast since in developing process variables for the different grades. We plan to continue commissioning throughout the facility during the coming months and to produce commercially viable products before midyear 2025.\nProduction is expected to grow to a 50% annual run rate by the end of 2025, and 75% capacity in 2026. Given current market conditions, we also expect to be a little EBITDA positive before year-end '25. We expect through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million, plus about $40 million to $50 million for the metals recycling platform. The most significant savings relative to our competition center on 4 key areas. Labor savings, higher recycled content, significant process yield improvements and logistics.\nIt can hardly be explained, but the excitement within our company is palpable. Especially within the Mississippi and San Luis Potosi aluminum sites. And it grows as our teams recognize our ability to revolutionize the North American aluminum industry as we did in steel. We are in passion by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton, the 4 value add lines and aluminum dynamics is largely spent with projected future through-cycle EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion.\n[ Geodynamics ] has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business of scale and diversification, driven by the best teams in the world. In the last 5 years, we've invested billions of dollars in our organic strategic growth. We've earned a return on invested capital of 24% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12%, and way higher than the best of our peer -- steel peers. We've increased our cash dividend over 90%. We repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares, all while maintaining best-in-class investment-grade credit metrics, and creating outstanding value for our customers and suppliers, our teams and our shareholders.\nI'm excited as investors recognize the power and consistency of our through-cycle cash generation, combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy and they value us accordingly, more like industrial companies. It is our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years that will amplify this position. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism that will provide a level playing field through continued and appropriate trade mechanisms.\nRisk mitigation to address numerous supply chain dislocations as accelerated reshoring of manufacturing. AI and cloud computing will support nonresidential construction, data centers, [ chip ] factories, battery plants and the like, along with growing fixed asset investment associated with public dollars. And lastly, decarbonization will materially steepen the global cost curve, providing steel dynamics with a huge competitive advantage to gain market share and increased metal spreads. Given our position of some of our sheet mills are the lowest carbon footprint in the world. This evolving metals business environment will amplify our earnings capability going forward.\nWe are blessed with good fortune. Our people are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. I would be remiss not to thank our lot of customers, many of whom supported us since our inception, some 31 years ago. These partnerships are based on trust, on doing what we say we will do, creating new solutions to enhance the value proposition. Our new aluminum partners will experience the same. And also our suppliers and service providers who we value and trust. Thank you.\nOur culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're a circular metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions, in turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles, providing enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. So we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead.\nAnd with that said, Matthew, could we turn it over to questions, please?"

Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you being with us on our second quarter '24 earnings call. As you likely read, our teams achieved a solid second quarter financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving another great quarter for safety. Teams have been commissioning and ramping up 4 new value-added lateral steel coating lines at a record rapid pace, which is adding 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification.\nThough experiencing some challenges in the second quarter, the [indiscernible] team continues to make progress gaining full access to the melting capacity this past week. Fuel shipments for the quarter were 3.2 million tonnes. Revenues were $4.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $686 million. Cash flow from operations was $383 million.\nI remain incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are family. It's an honor and a pleasure to be honest, to be part of the team that looks out for one another and that strives for excellence each and every day. And that's why we're so focused on providing the very best for their health, their safety and their welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. A significant impact, the team continues to be deeply focused on our tech controller safety program has yielding an even better safety culture. But as I always say, there's more to do, and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to add some color to the quarter?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and thanks to team for another solid performance. Our second quarter 2024 net income was $428 million or $2.72 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $686 million. Second quarter 2024 revenue of $4.6 billion was slightly below sequential first quarter results due to lower realized steel pricing. Our second quarter operating income of $559 million was 26% lower than first quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs.\nOur steel operations generated operating income of $442 million, 34% lower sequentially due to average realized pricing declining $63 to $1,138 per ton, while total shipments were generally steady. Uniquely, all of our steel mills, except for Roanoke had planned maintenance outages in the second quarter, which impacted utilization and related conversion costs for the quarter. Additionally, our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel division operated close to 60% of capacity for the quarter compared to almost 70% in the first quarter due to required outages to implement needed changes which Barry will describe in a moment.\nOperating income from our mills recycling operations was $32 million, significantly higher than sequential first quarter results despite lower realized pricing as volumes increased and the team continues to gain operating efficiencies. As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations and shortly also our aluminum flat-rolled operations.\nOur steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $181 million in the second quarter, slightly higher than first quarter sequential results. Earnings were supported with an 11% increase in shipments more than compensating for a 5% reduction in realized pricing. Our joist and debt backlog extend to the fourth quarter of 2024.\nInfrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, DOE, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investment and in turn, related flat and long product steel consumption and join consumption later this year and in the coming years.\nA reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. So you'll see increased costs in this line item until we start operations mid-2025. This amount was $19 million in the second quarter. Our supplemental schedule provides visibility as a separate aluminum segment. We estimate that average similar costs of approximately $25 million per quarter will occur through the first half of 2025. We have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for our aluminum investment with plans to initially ramp with industrial type products as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We expect to be operating the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capability for the full year 2026 and full thereafter.\nMark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations for aluminum investments later on the call as well as our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the aluminum rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. We want to reaffirm the total project cost at $2.7 billion of which $1.5 billion has already been invested through June of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to invest another $900 million in the aluminum investments. And finally, in 2025, the remaining $250 million.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $383 million. Inventories were moderately higher in the quarter as we increased product ahead of our new value-added flat-rolled coating lines. Additionally, estimated tax payments were $273 million in the quarter, representing a 23% cash tax rate for the first half of the year.\nWe ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.7 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and are fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. For 2024, we believe total capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which we've already funded $793 million this year. In February, we increased our quarterly cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our positive dividend profile as through-cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $607 million of our common stock in 2024, representing 3% of our outstanding shares.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to currently $2.9 billion excluding our large strategic [indiscernible] and aluminum investments.\nIn July, we successfully issued $600 million of 5.375% investment-grade notes with a 10-year tender. The proceeds will be used for general purposes and in anticipation of repaying our $400 million notes due December 2024. We're very pleased with the transaction. We thank those who invested.\nLastly, sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start commissioning late in the fourth quarter to decrease our Steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We uniquely have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe is considerably less expensive than [indiscernible] for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference.\nFinally, for those of you on the call that track categories of our flat-rolled steel shipments, in the second quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of [indiscernible], cold-rolled products of 124,000 tons and coated products of 1,245, 000 tons. Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our Steel Fabrication operations performed well in the second quarter, achieving strong earnings and steady volume aligned with first quarter results. The market segments that we participate in -- participate in influence the mix of joys a deck that we engineer for each job. Our team's ability to engineer and manufacture the best solution for each segment remains a core strength. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, not extending through the end of the year. We continue to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, continue with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025.\nOur steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, critical and softer demand environments allowing for higher through-cycle utilization compared to our peers, but also helps to mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.\nOur metals recycling operations improved earnings in the second quarter as increased demand for North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume, more than compensating for the challenging price environment. We believe ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers.\nIn particular, our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and [indiscernible] raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations.\nOur metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings potentials.\nField team had a solid quarter, achieving shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the second quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78% while our steel mills operated at a rate of 81%. We consistently operate at higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions in the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics.\nOur realized steel pricing declined across product portfolios as prices weakened throughout second quarter. However, value-added flat-rolled steel pricing spreads remained very resilient during the same time frame, supporting our earnings as we already are the largest producer of these products in North America. And we are growing with the new addition of 4 coating lines with 1.1 million tons of additional capacity.\nUnderlying demand remains steady, but customers remain hesitant to place orders due to the continuing decline of scrap prices throughout the quarter. Additionally, a [ surge ] in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics. However, order activity has increased over the last month, especially within the last several weeks, stabilizing our lead times, we believe this is the bottom ranch for pricing with positive moves in the future.\nThe Sinton steel team continues to make improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. We are planning for setting to see additional improvements in production and profitability as the team took 2 different day outages during the second quarter to, among other things, resolved the transform limitations we have previously discussed. The outages were necessary to install the necessary additional safety circuits and restore our electrical capacity, which will now allow us to access 100% of our the [indiscernible] capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional 2 new value line -- coating lines that's in were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with great success, improving the mill's value-added product mix and improving the operating efficiency of the facility. The additional alliance will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year.\nRegarding the steel market environment, North America automotive production estimates for 2024 recently revised was strong 16 million units with continued growth expected in '25 and 2026. This forecast is based on demand resilience of stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms despite the recent cyber disruptions. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some building types due to hesitancy around higher interest rates.\nAdditionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, the sole industry continues to grow, [indiscernible] oil and gas activity steady. However, increasing OTCG and line pipe imports created a challenging second quarter environment for the domestic producers.\nLooking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Theresa. Thank you, Barry. I appreciate that. But looking toward continued growth are consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. The 4 value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and have performed extremely well. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies.\nRegarding Sinton's progress, Barry will provide some more information, but the team completed a key task this week. And as we look forward to the rest of the year, we have confidence in increased volume and profitability from them.\n[indiscernible] growth strategy, I believe, is especially compelling. We're achieving fast-paced progress on the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics with the aluminum industry has become to consider a well-known and highly regarded metals producer today. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets still remain incredible.\nAs a quick overview of the project is a 650,000 metric tonne aluminum flat rolled facility in Columbus, Mississippi. So the state-of-the-art plant and with an optimized target mix of 300,000 tonnes of can stock [indiscernible] of industrial and construction products. On-site melting and casting slab capacity to 600,000 metric tons and be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap ridge regions.\nWe expanded the product scope to include additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize our aluminum recycled content. Start-up plans right now for the rolling mill to start up in mid-25, the Mexico Slab Center in the first quarter '25 with the U.S. lab center coming in online in the second half of '25.\nFrom an investment premise perspective, I think the market environment today in [indiscernible] is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It has older assets, that has heavy legacy costs, the mills are somewhat inefficient and high-cost operations. As an industry that has difficulty -- or has had difficulty in earning cost of capital and hence, has little investment in facilities and new technologies over time. Different though than the steel environment 30 years ago is that there's an absolute supply [indiscernible], which exists in the market in North America, and that deficit is likely to grow. It's aligned with our business, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction and operational know-how, and we can drive performance through our culture, which in turn, will drive high efficiency and low-cost operation. It also levers our omni recycling footprint. Today, Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler, and has developed some very unique and innovative separation technologies that can segregate the different aluminum supply streams coming to them. So very, very cost effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us.\nThe team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as I said in the first quarter '25 followed by the commission on the Roanoke mill mid-25, and those are both on schedule for those days. In '25, we plan to begin production with a mix heavier weighted to industrial and construction product sectors, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We believe volumes for the second half of 25% will be at 50% of capacity, growing to 75% in 2026. Through the first 24 months, we will continue to transition the product mix to more can sheet in automotive. -- targeting the 45% [indiscernible] sheet, 30%, 35% automotive in probably 2027.\nWe have some key can and auto customers that are keen in helping us achieve the highest quality in a shorter time as possible. And I know our team is up to it.\nThe total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is $2.7 billion, and we are confident in the budget. Virtually all equipment and construction contracts are complete. And we also expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for the Omni recycling platform, and we are confident in our operating cost assumptions. And some of you have asked us to try and quantify these areas of savings as we've outlined them in the past and help you differentiate our project to the rest of the industry.\nThe most significant savings are in 4 key areas: labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. The labor, which makes up, in our mind, about 35% of the differential, we will have a reduced workforce. We would anticipate somewhere around 750 people versus over 1,200 or more for a competitive plan today. That comes from an optimized plant layout and material flow.\nAnd we also have a central automated storage system. So when there will be no sort of human touch to the product from slab to truck, eliminating a massive amount of material handling and a huge number of folks, we drive productivity through our culture and our performance-based incentives. We obviously will not have the high legacy costs that some, again, existing competitors have today. And I would suggest that there should be no data that we can achieve these sorts of things, the productivity levels, et cetera, as we have done in steel over the years.\nThe second differential would be recycled content, and that's probably 25% of the differential. I believe can do that through levering the OmniSource platform. Again, the largest nonferrous recycler in North America today. We already have a secondary aluminum operation that we can also lean on. The satellite facilities will also help being close to UBC rich areas. Again, I think the innovative segregation technologies that we've developed actually in-house will also allow us to increase the recycled content compared to our competitors.\nThe third area would be yield. And I think we're being a little conservative here, but that would be about 20% of the differential. Firstly, obviously, we're going to have just a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which will help for sure. The sculpting technology is an innovative state-of-the-art, it doesn't just rely on just shaving off the half and into 3 quarters [indiscernible] whatever of the slab. It measures the profile of the slab, measures the quality of the slab, and we will only take off what is absolutely needed.\nWe will also be utilizing through the mill sort of supersized coils. So the less front-end tails, et cetera, [indiscernible] so I think we're comfortable with the substantial improvement in yield.\nAnd then logistics are probably 10% of that. And again, locating the slab satellite lab centers next to or within UBC rich areas, allowing us to melt and cast that material and ship big, heavy, solid slab versus less dense [indiscernible] and then taking the yield loss there is a considerable freight advantage to that.\nWe're excited, and I think that excitement is palpable within our company as our younger generations want to emulate our steel history and revolutionize the North American aluminum market.\nMore generally, we're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. A disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation.\nNear term, the continued symptom ramp-up of 4 new coating lines, closely followed by our aluminum strategy will significantly increase that through cycle cash flow generation. And I'm excited looking forward. I believe that the market dynamics are in place to support long-term demand growth across all our operating platforms. As Theresa mentioned, North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Act and other public programs. Geodynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. Furthermore, and I don't believe it should be understated, we were blessed with the best-in-class carbon footprint.\nOur integrated peers, both domestic and global, will be spending substantial CapEx to bring their carbon footprint down. Those that are including hydrogen-based DRI, but also incur additional operating expense of some $200 per ton. This will materially [indiscernible] the global cost curve and will support higher product pricing in the future. And we, SDI being at the bottom of the cost curve will effectively expand our long-term metal spread through the cycle.\nIn closing, our teams, as I've always said in our foundation, I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication, we are committed to them, and remind them to listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and our business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. And we are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles.\nWe are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. That being said, Matt, would love to listen to all here [indiscernible] the questions."

Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you for our first quarter '24 earnings call today. Once again, our teams achieved a strong first quarter financial and operational performance.\nQuarterly steel shipments were a near record 3.3 million tons. The team successfully began operating our 4 new value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines, which adds about 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification to our portfolio. The Sinton team continues to make significant headway hitting record milestones and achieving positive EBITDA for the quarter, with significant improvements on the way. And we're also making fast progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments.\nThere continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution provided by Steel Dynamics, as we are a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. And financially, the team continues to excel. They consistently achieve superior financial metrics and best-in-class return on invested capital.\nIt's a product of the passionate can-do performance-driven culture and our high-margin value-added growth strategy. A stark and persuasive indicator of the effectiveness of our business model is our relative of EBITDA per employee generation, which is substantially higher than any of our competition.\nI'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success, and I'm proud to stand among them. They are special and we're focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level of our company, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. Despite excellent safety performance compared to industry peers, there's more to do. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries.\nBut with that, Teresa, would you like to give us some color on the quarter?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I add my sincere thanks to our teams for another strong performance. Our first quarter 2024 net income was $584 million or $3.67 per diluted share, with adjusted EBITDA of $879 million. .\nFirst quarter 2024 revenue of $4.7 billion was 11% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, supported by strong volume and higher realized selling values across the Steel platform. Our first quarter operating income of $751 million was 45% higher than fourth quarter results, driven by Steel Metal spread expansion, especially within our flat-rolled operations.\nA quick note, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. So you will see increased costs in that line item as we start operations mid-2025. In the first quarter, that additional amount was about $14 million.\nAs we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2024 and beyond, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel division operated close to 70% of capacity for the quarter, and as Mark said, generated positive earnings. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $675 million in the first quarter, supported by near-record shipments and increased realized product pricing.\nFor those of you who track flat-rolled products by type, in the first quarter, hot rolled shipments were 1.62 million tons, cold-rolled shipments were 130,000 tons and coated shipments were 1. 220 million tons. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $23 million, significantly higher than sequential fourth quarter results as increased domestic steel demand supported higher volumes.\nAs many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations as well as shortly, our aluminum flat-rolled operations.\nOur steel fabrication segment achieved strong operating income of $178 million in the first quarter, lower than sequential fourth quarter results due to weather impacted and seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as realized pricing declined and steel raw material input cost increased.\nOur joist Index backlog extends through the third quarter 2024 with strong forward pricing, and pricing has stabilized at historically strong levels during the quarter. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act and DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investments later this year and into next year, which will support our steel operations and our fabrication business.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $355 million, which was reduced by an annual company-wide profit sharing contribution of $265 million.\nWe ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion. For 2024, we believe full year capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and $175 million toward our biocarbon facility.\nIn February, we increased our cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our increasing dividend profile as through cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $298 million of our common stock, representing 1.5% of our outstanding shares.\nAt March 31, $1.1 billion remained available for our share repurchases under our new $1.5 billion plan. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program.\nWhile we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation, our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million from 2011 to 2015, to currently $2.9 billion. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment-grade metrics.\nWe believe our track record proves itself with an average 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, clearly a best-in-class performance across industries. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.\nIn that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start operating late in the fourth quarter, could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than they lay ahead for many of our industry peers.\nOur sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and continue our leadership role moving forward. Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Theresa. Our Steel Fabrication Operations performed well in the first quarter, achieving strong earnings. At the end of the first quarter, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the third quarter of 2024.\nAdditionally, current pricing has stabilized at historically high levels during the first quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the business. Continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025.\nOur fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments. Allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.\nOur Metals Recycling Operations improved earnings in the first quarter as increased demand from North American steel producers, supported higher ferrous scrap volume and the team continues to grow our volume and recycled aluminum in advance of starting our new aluminum flat-rolled operations.\nThe North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers.\nIn particular, our Mexican recycling operations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations.\nOur metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities.\nThe steel team had a strong quarter, achieving near-record shipments of 3.3 million tons. During the first quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated and an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at 87%. We consistently operated higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.\nThe higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing improved across our product portfolios.\nHowever, spot rolled prices weakened early in the first quarter before recovering in March and April. Value-add flat-rolled steel pricing spreads are incredibly resilient, actually expanding during the same time frame. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers are managing to a lower inventory level, which can cause some volatility in spot prices.\nAs order activity increased quarter-over-quarter, our steel backlogs also improved nicely from December to March across the platform. As per site, the team continues to make significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They averaged around 70% of capability for the quarter, breaking monthly utilization records across the lines in March. We are planning for then to see additional improvements in production as the team took several maintenance days in April.\nAmong other things, in the outage, we resolved certain transformer limitations, which will allow us to access 100% of our melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with excellent results. These additional lines will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year.\nRegarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024 were recently revised higher to just over 16 million units with continued growth expected in 2025 and 2026. And, this improved forecast is based on demand resilience and stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate across the automotive supply chain.\nAutomotive dealer inventories are also continuing to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained solid as supported by the increased sequentially quarterly order activity and shipments at our Structural and Rail division. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects in the coming years.\nAs for the energy markets, the solar industry continues to grow and oil and gas activity is steady. However, increasing OCTG and line pipe imports created a challenging first quarter environment for the domestic producer. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing demand for 2024.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Barry. Thanks, Theresa. While consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As mentioned, the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are now online and in various modes of startup. And certainly, the line in Sinton was an absolute unqualified success.\nThe team has done a phenomenal job there. And sign should see a step function improvement in operations and profitability as those 2 new lines ramp up after the April maintenance, which occurred actually 2 weeks ago, that's -- they're up and running again.\nThe aluminum strategy, our growth is especially compelling, responses from existing and new customers across all markets remains incredible and only strengthening as we move forward. We are currently in discussions with numerous customers who wish to locate on site with us and this co-location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money and reducing emissions across the supply chain.\nAnd this model has already proven itself tremendously successful in symptom -- and to just sort of review the project itself, 650,000 metric tons of aluminum flat rolled capability in Columbus, Mississippi. The state-of-the-art plan, it has served the sustainable beverage and packaging sector, automotive and industrial markets as well. The roughly 300,000 metric tons a year of can stock about 200,000 tons of water and 150,000 tons of industrial and construction.\nActually at the site in Columbus, we'll have a mega capacity of around 600,000 metric tons and that will be supported by 2 satellite facilities, one out west around Gulaband and 1 in Central Mexico, which are located in scrap-rich regions. We can capture the scrap, turn it into the cast lab and transport it very, very effectively and cost efficiently to the mill itself. Expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content.\nThe Metals recycling team has also developed a commercially viable sorting solution at volume for 5000 and 6000 series aluminum scrap, which represents an incredible competitive advantage for us.\nOur startup plans have not changed. The rolling mill should be operating mid-2025. The Mexico slab Center at the end of '24 and then Arizona mid-'25. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers remains at $2.7 billion. And with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we feel confident in the expected amount of investment.\nWe also are confident that it will add around about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an initial $40 million to $50 million from the Omni platform as well. The investment premise, if you think about it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago.\nThey have older assets, they've had difficulty earning their cost of capital. So there's been a little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficient and operations are typically high cost. And also a significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit exists in North America, which is expected to grow. And this will be the first time we've ever entered a market where there's a supply/demand gap, that's a pretty positive for us for sure.\nWe have business alignment and we can leverage our core competencies of construction and operational know-how. We can lever Omni's recycling footprint. As many of you know, we're the largest aluminum scrap recycler in North America. And again, we are developing some pretty exciting new separation technologies. So it's going to be cost effective. It's a very, very high return growth for us.\nMoving on, we are in passion, I think, by our future growth plans, as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum, we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest, most recent 5-year average after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. And in the most recent 3 years, we have had an average of after-tax return on invested capital of 32%. Which I think is a stunning number and an affirmation of the ability of all our team.\nOur disciplined and intentional growth strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions to provide sustainable and growing cash generation. And we'll continue to do so in the future. So I'm incredibly optimistic moving forward.\nI believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in '24. North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, the Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Steel Dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum.\nAs I said earlier, our teams are our foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We are committed to them, and I remind those listening today, the safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class operating and financial metrics.\nWe're no longer a simple steel company. We're an industrial metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to numerous industries that are essential to global economies. This differentiation and diversification mitigates cash generation volatility in all market cycles, as we've just seen in this past quarter. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our companies for our customers, team members and shareholders alike, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today in the many years ahead.\nWith that said, Matthew, could you open the line up for questions, please?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, January 24, 2024, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Holly. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nThe other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions.\nExamples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled. Steel Dynamics Reports Fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. As you saw in our release, our teams achieved a strong annual 2023 financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving our best safety year with the lowest recordable incident rate ever. I want to applaud and congratulate all the teams because that is a monumental effort put to get there.\nSteel shipments were a record 12.8 million tonnes. I think it needs to be emphasized that we've got 3 million tonnes yet of additional shipping capability to leverage. We have the second best year for revenues of $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion. I think the year clearly demonstrated the through-cycle earnings resilience of our business model as manifest by a diverse value-add product portfolio, supported by a superior operating culture, driving world-class low-cost operations.\nI can't be more pleased at Sinton. Sinton is showing significant operating improvement was EBITDA positive in December with a clear path to profitability in the first quarter of 2024 and thereafter. We're also achieving fast-paced progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics, where the alumin industry is considering a well-known and highly regarded metals producer.\nI'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success. And to be honest, they inspire me. Giving their precore and commitment to the SDI family during the recent holiday parties was absolutely just simply humbling. And that is why we are so focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind in an active conversation each and every day. As I already suggested, without focus, the team's safety performance was a record low incident rate in 2023.\nObviously, though, there's more to do. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries. With that said, I will hand it to Theresa, who will then bet the board to Barry, and then back to me to finish up. So Theresa?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us today. In addition to the achievements Mark just mentioned, the teams also achieved our third best year for operating income of $3.2 billion and net income of $2.5 billion or $14.64 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations and liquidity of $3.5 billion and a 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32% a truly great performance. My sincere thank you and congratulations to our entire team.\nAs for the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $424 million or $2.61 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $659 million. Fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $4.2 billion and operating income of $519 million were lower than sequential third quarter results driven by seasonally lower volume and realized steel and steel fabrication pricing.\nOur steel operations generated operating income of $365 million in the fourth quarter lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat-rolled steel pricing. Our steel shipments remained steady at 3.1 million tons. Our 4 new flat-rolled coating lines have or will begin operating this quarter increasing our higher-margin value-added product mix by an additional 1 million tons, making our capacity in value-added and flat roll at 7 million tons on the coating line.\nFor the full year of 2023, operating income from our steel operations was $1.9 billion with record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons. For those of you that track our flat-rolled shipments and more specificity, hot rolled coil and P&O shipments were 927,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments 124,000 tons and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tonnes. For metals recycling, fourth quarter operating income was $6 million due to seasonally lower volume in nonferrous metal spread compression.\nFor the full year, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $108 million, lower than prior year results based on decreased ferrous scrap pricing more than offsetting higher volume. We're are the largest nonferrous and ferrous metals recycler in all of North America, recycling aluminum, copper and other metals.\nThe team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model providing high-quality, low-cost scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $250 million in the fourth quarter, lower than sequential third quarter results yet historically strong due to lower pricing and seasonally lower shipments.\nOur steel fabrication platform had another great year in 2023 with operating income of $1.6 billion. Congratulations to the team. Our steel joist endectomyand remained solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first half of 2024, and forward pricing remains strong. Infrastructure, inflation reduction at the DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel consumption and related joist and that consumption as well.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $865 million. For the full year, we achieved our second best annual cash flow of $3.5 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.5 billion. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in capital investments, of which almost 60% related to the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments.\nFor 2024, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion related to the aluminum investments. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend at $0.425 per common share after increasing at 25% in the first quarter of 2023. During the full year of 2023, we paid cash dividends of $271 million and repurchased $1.5 billion or 8% of our outstanding shares, representing a 62% net income shareholder distribution rate.\nThe Board also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program in November and $1.4 billion remained available at the end of the year. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $5.5 billion of our common stock or 37% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.8 billion.\nWe are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Our 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32% is a testament to our profitable growth. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.\nWe have an actionable path forward to carbon neutrality as more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive that then lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you for your time this morning. Barry?\n\nBarry T. Schneider\n\nSVP of Flat Roll Steel Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Teresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2023, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the first half of 2024. We continue to have high expectations for the business.\nContinued onshoring and manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs would continue to provide momentum for additional construction spending. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our optimism. Fair pricing has stabilized at historically high levels and order entry has improved.\nFabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations also performed well this year, considering the challenge of declining scrap prices throughout much of 2023.\nThe North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and citing raw material positions. They will strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments.\nI bet our recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand our scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase the earnings opportunities.\nThe steel team had another strong year, achieving record volume of 12.8 million tons. During 2023, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 76%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93%, excluding the seton plant. We consistently operate at higher utilization due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.\nThis higher through-cycle utilization of all our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Regarding the steel markets, steel pricing improved in the fourth quarter of 2023 and into January. Customer order entry rate has been strong and lead times have been extended while their inventory levels remain at historically low amounts.\nIn fact, our flat-rolled steel operations have experienced one of the strongest order entry environments in January, especially for our value-added products. Additionally, steel imports have generally remained at a manageable level with expectations of this to continue. As recent and the team has achieved significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They average about 65% of capability in November, December and have been running even stronger rates here in January.\nWe are planning for setting to see additional improvements in production after the team makes changes through certain transfers at the end of this first quarter of 2024 while we allow access to 100% of our mill capacity versus the current 80% capacity. Additionally, the 2 new value-added coating lines will begin operating in the first quarter, supporting increased volume and margins.\nRegarding steel the market environment, automotive production estimates for 2024 or an estimated 16 million units, while automotive dealer inventories remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our Structural and Rail division and customer inventory levels are low.\nAdditionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related to construction-oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, oil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and solar, those areas all grow. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. With that, Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Barry. Thanks, Theresa. I think our consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As Barry mentioned, the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are starting this quarter and Singen should see a step function improvement, hitting its stride in the second quarter of this year.\nOur aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling, responses from existing and new customers across all markets remain incredible, only strengthening as we move forward. Many customers have already indicated they would like to build facilities on our rolling mill site in Columbus, Mississippi. And this co-location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money and reducing emissions across the supply chain and has already proven itself clearly in Santam.\nThe project itself was 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. It's going to be a state-of-the-art plant, obviously, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging both body and then TAM, automotive and industrial sectors. Roughly 300,000 metric tons of Canstar which is about 45% of the output roughly 200,000 tonnes of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial and construction products.\nThe on-site Melta cost capability of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions, 1 in West and 1 in Central Mexico. The expanded product scope is including additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. Our plans on schedule rolling mill should be mid-'25, the Mexico slab Center at the end of '24, and then Arizona slab center around mid-'25.\nThe total project cost, as you saw in the release, including the recycled slab centers has risen to $2.7 billion. The installation cost for the rolling mill has expanded due to inflationary installation costs that we are all facing. So with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we are confident in this final budget. As we've said before, 100% to be funded with cash.\nAnd the expectation is to have a through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million from the [indiscernible] facility with an additional $40 million to $50 million from Amesare. I think we're definitely going to see superior financial metrics relative to our competition. The -- as we see it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago, other assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs with inefficient high-cost operations. We're confident we can emulate the performance-driven high-efficiency, low-cost model that drove our success in steel to drive superior financial metrics.\nOur organizational mill structure to just advanced layout and technology and our performance-driven sort of speed core culture will drive a census of around about 750 people versus typically 2,000 or more in a similar competitor out there.\nWe will have higher yield through the system. We will leverage OmniSource's market position and their separation technologies to ensure higher recycled content. We obviously won't have the legacy burden that others have. We will have production cost efficiencies and along with the customer co-location. In the end, we also have a preferred sustainability profile.\nIf you put it all together, we're confident that our earnings profile is going to be far superior to the industry today. We've developed the best financial metrics in the steel industry. And as I said, we have confidence we can do the same in aluminum. We're poised for continued growth. We have an additional 3 million tons, as I said earlier, have shipping capability that will be leveraged through our new processing lines, new products and new supply chains. And we are on passion by our future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years.\nWe have the highest average 5-year after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. In the last 3 years, we had an average after-tax ROIC of 32%. I'm going to say that just doesn't happen. Our disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation and strong returns.\nI continue to be optimistic moving forward. I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in 2024 and the years ahead. North America will benefit from continued onshoring and manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs.\nFuel Dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. In closing, there is no doubt our teams are our foundation. And I thank each of them for their passion and dedication.\nWe're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance. leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry and, in turn, mitigating volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles.\nWe're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today and the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, I would love for you to open it up for questions."

You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2023 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. As you saw in the release, once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Almost 80% of our facilities had 0 safety incidents and our company-wide trailing 12-month incident rate is running at an all-time low. So populations to everyone. But more importantly, thank you for all your work to make that happen.\nIt takes each and every one of us to get there. Cash from operations was a healthy $1.1 billion and with adjusted EBITDA generation of $876 million. Steel's performance truly affirms the cash generation and resiliency of our diversified value-added product portfolio. Seen significant momentum in Ireland and flat roll investments, both current and prospective customers are excited by our market entry and a new and differentiated supply chain solutions we can provide. They are actually very, very surprised by the speed and completeness of our execution so far. Sinton mill has proven its nameplate production capacity rate and full product capability but does remain challenged by equipment reliability issues. We are confident we can resolve the majority of these issues by the year end. Successes cannot be achieved without the best metals team in the industry. I'm incredibly proud of the whole SDI family. Their passion and spirit form the foundation of our company.\nThey drive our success, and it's an honor to work among them. In fact, in this world of of turmoil with the human catastrophe happening in the Ukraine, the atrocity in Israel, the suppression of the Palestinian people. And even closer to home, the angering diverseness within America and our political structure really is inspiring to come to work each and every day and be surrounded by very, very positive people that I think right, they get it, they treat people right and are focused on what we do each and every day.\nAs such, our greatest leadership commitment is to our SDI family, not only our colleagues that come to work for us or their partners in life and their kids. I remind our teams, great financial performance of no importance without keeping everyone safe. We continue to be focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. Today, the SDI family, when you include everyone, we have over 45,000 people that are reliant on the decisions we make each and every day, and we're focused -- we truly are focused on that. Together, we're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation. Before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some details.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, Mark. And my sincere appreciation to our teams for a really solid performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter 2023 net income was $577 million or $3.47 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $876 million. Third quarter 2023 revenues of $4.6 billion and operating income of $734 million were lower than sequential second quarter results driven by lower realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. We see solid industry fundamentals for the rest of this year and beyond, and we're focused on our continued transformational growth initiatives.\nOur steel operations generated operating income of $474 million in the third quarter, lower than sequential second quarter results due to flat-rolled steel pricing metal spread compression as realized pricing declined more than average scrap costs. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons, excluding the lost volume of approximately 90,000 tons related to Sinton's unplanned July outage. We expect our 4 new flat-rolled coating lines to begin operating in the first quarter of 2024 at both Sinton and Heartland, increasing our value-added mix by an additional 1 million tons, making so that our total coating capacity will be 6.9 million tons going forward.\nFor those that track our detailed flat-rolled shipments, in the third quarter, we had hot rolled and P&O shipments of 858,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 tons and coated shipments of 1,202,000 tons. Operating income from our melgecycling operations was $19 million, significantly lower than second quarter results due to nonferrous unferrous metal spread compression. Ferrous scrap demand was also reduced as numerous domestic steel mills had maintenance outages in the quarter. We are the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals.\nThe team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing higher quality, lower-cost scrap to our seal mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $330 million in the third quarter. Lower than sequential second quarter results yet historically strong as average realized pricing declined 11% and volumes declined 16,000 tons. Our steel joist and deck demand remained solid with good order activity.\nOur backlog extends through the first quarter of 2024. The backlog has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. Forward backlog pricing remains very strong and spot pricing resilience. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain solid in the fourth quarter, but below third quarter levels based on seasonally lower volumes. Infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act Department of Energy decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment in related steel and joist and debt consumption in the coming years.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and generated $2.7 billion on a year-to-date basis. At September 30, we achieved record liquidity of $3.7 billion, inclusive of cash liquid investments and our unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. Year-to-date of 2023, we've invested $1.1 billion in capital investments.\nFor the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, of which around $350 million is related to our aluminum flat rolled investments. Much of the remaining capital is related to the completion of our 4 new value-added coated lines. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Year-to-date 2023, we've also repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock, representing almost 6% of our outstanding shares. At September 30, $278 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion authorized plan.\nSince 2017, we've increased our dividend per share by 174% and repurchased $5.2 billion of our common stock, representing over 40% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation at the same time.\nOur free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years, generating from an annual average of $540 million to $2.6 billion today. We've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this philosophy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations.\nWe also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we've clearly demonstrated. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility could decrease our Steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35% and we currently expect to have the facility operating in the second half of 2024.\nWe have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive that may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with its intention to make a positive difference. And again, before I turn the call back over to Mark, I just want to thank the teams for a great performance. Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. As you saw, the steel fabrication platform continues to perform well and it turned in another solid quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the future earnings profile of this business. We believe nonresidential construction markets will be strong in the coming years on residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong into 2024 and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to the last year at this time.\nSo political dysfunction has delayed the awarding of public monies likely into the first quarter of next year. The infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, along with the reshoring of manufacturing should provide momentum for additional construction spending through 2024, effectively extending the construction cycle. And customer commentary, as I talked to our folks out there has confirmed our positive outlook. The fabrication order backlog is certainly shortened from its historical high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains strong from a historical perspective, standing through March 2024 with strong forward pricing. Current order entry pricing remains resilient.\nSummary of a significant contributor onto itself. Our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume across steel mills. Particularly important in softer markets, plan for a higher through-cycle steel production utilization rates compared to our peers, adding to the resiliency of our through-cycle cash generation. Furthermore, it provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform had a challenging quarter as demand from domestic steel mills softened and realized ferrous scrap prices declined.\nScarp prices pulled back in the third quarter with busheling prices falling some $80 a ton. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and sent and raw material positions. We also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metal's team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technological solutions, enhancing margin and increasing the availability of low residual ferrous scrap.\nThis will mitigate prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities on that platform. Our steel operations achieved strong shipments of 3.1 million tons and solid financial results in the third quarter. Steel production utilization rate when you exclude Sinton was 90% and compared to a domestic industry rate of some 76%. Higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles, driven by the value-added diversified product offerings which amount to 70% of our sales.\nAnd this as Theresa mentioned, will increase further with the addition of 2 galvanizing and 2 paint lines that will be commissioned in the first quarter of '24. Differentiated supply chain solutions driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility and support of downstream internal pull-through manufacturing volume are all contributors. Our higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, steel backlogs are strong and customer order entry is good. Customer inventories are also at historically low levels.\nAuto production estimates for '23 remain around 15 million units. But obviously, with the ongoing strike, the outlook for the remainder of the year is somewhat opaque. So positively, dealer inventories remain below historical norms, which will be further reduced by the ongoing strike. Demand there is still strong and with tight supply the auto build rate will likely be higher than the already anticipated [ 16 ] million unit plus to 24%. In the meantime, Unfortunately, our auto direct flat roll exposure all concentrated towards European and Asian producers, which so far has mitigated the strike impact on our flat rolled auto volume.\nAlthough not a significant impact to overall earnings, we are seeing greater impact at our Engineered Bar division as their 15%, 20% auto exposure is mostly consumed by domestic auto producers. Nonresidential construction remains solid. A long product steel backlogs are good and customer inventory levels are low. General market is estimated to be up 8% or some due to seasonality, but should rebound as infrastructure spending provides meaningful support in the first half of '24. The turndown in residential construction seems to be abating with the depletion of available home inventory.\nOil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG products and solar continues to grow at a rapid rate. In total aggregate, long product demand remains solid. And in flat roll, lead times are expanding. We're seeing excellent order entry, supply chain inventory is low and pricing is certainly in an upward trend. We certainly anticipate further meaningful strength once the strike is concluded.\nTurning to Sinton. After the unplanned July outage related to the [indiscernible] the Sinton team produced over 290,000 tons in the quarter. The mill has clearly demonstrated its production rate capability been achieving 36 heat sequence is, and it's exceeded its hourly nameplate run rate. However, as I said, the constrained production is manifest from a low utilization rate caused principally by equipment reliability issues. That said, we expect to progressively ramp up to about 70% total run rate by the end of 2023, reaching a production of 2.4 million tons for 2024.\nDespite our challenges, the team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas steel mill. We have completed full product dimensional capability. It's proven up to 1-inch thick down to [indiscernible] I do believe, after 84-inch width. Customers are reporting exceptional surface quality and the [indiscernible] design is allowed for thermo mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades tough grades with lower alloy content and thus lowering costs for those value-added products.\nWe've achieved Grade A 100 and already been approved for some API grades. I think just generally, it affirms our technical and process choices. And there's no doubt that in my mind, it's the next generation of [ electric car ] furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance, and we can sell every pound of steel we make. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance, continues to support our cash generation and our growth investment strategies.\nRelative to our expansion into aluminum, as I said, the responses from existing and new customers across all markets is absolutely incredible. We are developing the site. We purchased some 2,600 acres, I do believe. But we're developing it for the co-location of customers for the rolling mill as we successfully did in Sinton. We're seeing a number of customers are already indicating strong interest in that model because it provides a sustainable competitive model for all of us.\nTo recap the project the 650,000 metric ton flat roll facility, [ Nerolie ] will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, state-of-the-art facility, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors. Approximately 300,000 metric tons will be can, 200,000 tons auto and 150,000 industrial. We have on-site melt and cast slab capacity in Columbus of around 600,000 metric tons. And the project will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers one in Central Mexico and one in Arizona to capture scrap close to its source. We'll have 2 cash lines, coating lines and downstream processing and packaging lines to fully support our customers base.\nSetup plans are still anticipated for a mid-25 start up for the rolling mill. Mexico Slab Center should start up late '24, perhaps January '25 and Arizona Snap Center in the first quarter of '25. Total project cost including all recycled slab centers is around $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with cash. As we've stated in the past, we expect through cycle annual EBITDA of around about $650 million to $700 million from the aluminum portion. And the support of OmniSource will draw another $40 million to $50 million for them. I think the market from an investment premise perspective, what excites me is the market environment is very similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago.\nThe industry generally has older assets, had a tough time earning its cost of capital. There's been little reinvestment over the last 4, 5 years. It has heavy legacy costs tends to be inefficient in high-cost operations. Parallels the situation we saw within the steel industry 30 Years Ago. According that, we see a definite deficiency in supply that exists in North America, and that deficiency is expected to grow even with our and second competitor's new facility.\nFrom our perspective, it is an adjacent industry to us. It leverages our ability to design and build commission ramp-up for large capital assets and operate those assets very effectively, efficiently at low cost. Through our performance incentivized, innovative and very effective culture. In closing, we're excited and in passion and we always are and we continue to be by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. [ Ultium ] business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that is rewarded shareholder by top-in-class returns.\nWe're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. Turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. Our teams, our foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. And as I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and your families and to each other is the highest of priorities.\nBut competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members, our shareholders alike. Thank you. Thank you for joining us again today. And Holly, we would love to turn it over to questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, July 20, 2023, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Holly. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today.\nLeading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently.\nSuch statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting out new assets in the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel metal recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors and on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q.\nYou also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Second Quarter 2023 Results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us on our second quarter earnings call. Once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Highlights included continued safety improvement, 81% of our facilities were incident free through the quarter.\nCash from operations of $808 million and EBITDA generation of $1.2 billion. We also received improved investment-grade credit ratings, providing further third-party confirmation of the strength of our business model. We're also making significant progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments. There is great excitement within the prospective customer base for new and innovative supply chain solutions from a differentiated supplier. I'm incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success. Is their culture of excellence, combined with our meaningful value-added growth, diversification and supply chain positioning that is resulting in our earnings strength in all market cycles.\nHowever, as I've often said, great financial performances of no importance without safety for SDI family. We are focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation. Our focus, as I said, the team's safety performance further improved in the second quarter, way ahead of industry averages. There's more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries.\nBut before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some financial color.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong performance. Our second quarter 2023 net income was $812 million or $4.81 per diluted share with, as Mark mentioned, EBITDA of $1.1 billion.\nSecond quarter 2023 revenues of $5.1 billion were higher than sequential first quarter results, driven by increased realized steel selling values. Our second quarter operating income of $1.1 billion was 27% higher than first quarter results as a result of significantly expanded steel metal spread.\nAs we discuss our business this morning, we are positive with industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2023 and beyond, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $706 million in the second quarter due to metal spread expansion and near-record shipments of 3.2 million tonnes. Higher realized pricing more than offset moderately higher scrap costs in the quarter.\nWe realized increased pricing and metal spread across both our flat rolled and our long product steel operations. As a reminder, we are the primary domestic steel supplier into the railroad rail market as well as a producer of all other long steel products, including structural steel, special bar quality, merchant shapes, specialty shapes and reinforcing bar with over 4.5 million tonnes of annual capacity.\nOperating income from our metals recycling operations was $40 million, consistent with sequential first quarter results due to increased shipments being offset by lower metal spreads. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing model benefiting us by providing high-quality, lower-cost scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital.\nOur Mexico recycling operations also provide a competitive advantage for reliable supply as well as for future increased scrap aluminum collection. We are the largest North American metals recycler today processing and using ferroscrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $462 million in the second quarter lower than first quarter results but historically strong as average pricing decreased 13% and volumes were steady.\nOur steel joist and deck order backlog extends into the first quarter of 2024. It has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. However, forward backlog pricing remains very strong and price -- spot pricing remains very resilient.\nBased on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong, but slightly lower than the first half of 2023 levels for the second half of the year. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Labor, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support not only fixed asset investment in steel consumption, but also steel joist index demand in the coming years.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. At June 30, our liquidity was $3.5 billion, inclusive of our recently renewed unsecured $1.2 billion revolver.\nI'd like to congratulate the team. They actually refinanced revolver yesterday. So thank you to Rick and Dominic. During the second quarter of 2023, we generated cash flow from operations of $808 million and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. During the first half, we invested $585 million in fixed asset investments. We believe capital investments for the second half of the year will be in the range of $1 billion. The vast majority relating to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our 4 flat-rolled steel coating lines by the end of 2023.\nIn February, we increased our cash dividend 25% and repurchased $734 million or 3.9% of our outstanding shares in 2023. At June 30, $606 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion program that we put in place during November of 2022.\nSince 2017, we've increased our cash dividend 174% and repurchased $4.8 million of our common stock, representing 39% of our outstanding shares. And recognition of our growth, strong balance sheet profile and consistent free cash flow generation capability, last month, we received upgrades, as Mark mentioned, to our investment grade credit designation from both Moody's and from S&P.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a positive base dividend that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to our investment-grade credit designation.\nWe've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that supports meaningful strategic growth strong shareholder returns and investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally increased over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million to $2.6 billion currently. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions, as we have clearly demonstrated, we are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation.\nSustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our businesses with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than they may lay ahead for many of our industry and other peers.\nOur sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference playing a leadership role. For those of you on the call, but like to track the product differentiation among our flat-rolled shipments. For the second quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 972,000 tonnes. Our cold-rolled shipments were 149,000 tonnes, and our coated shipments were 1,150,000 tonnes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. And hopefully, folks can hear us -- I know it's -- I guess is not quite up to snuff today, so I apologize for that. But nonetheless, our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. The team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job there. 1 second. Everyone apologies, but it appears that many folks can't hear us, hear the call. I would ask you to hang up and call back in and we'll just pause the call for a second. Thank you.\n\nChristopher A. Graham\n\nSVP of Manufacturing Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, apologies. Please remain connected. David, we will dial out to you and reconnect on your line. Ladies and gentlemen, participants please remain connected. We will reconnect the speaker line. David will dial out to you momentarily.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for holding, ladies and gentlemen. We do apologize. Please remain on the line. The Steel Dynamics conference call will resume shortly. And the speaker line is now reconnected.\n\nChristopher A. Graham\n\nSVP of Manufacturing Group, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSorry about that where you were.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nAgain. Apparently, I believe you heard everything that's been said, but it's very, very choppy. So obviously, we'll clarify things in the Q&A that perhaps you didn't hear. I was just kicking off our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. That team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job. So thank you to each and every 1 of them.\nWe continue to have high expectations for that business, and we believe nonresidential construction markets will continue to be strong in the coming years. Nonresidential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong through the rest of this year and into '24 and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to last year at this time.\nContinued onshoring of manufacturing businesses, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs should provide momentum for additional construction spending and extend the whole nonresidential construction cycle. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our perspective.\nOur steel fabrication order backlog has shortened from its all-time high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains very strong from a historical perspective, extending into January of 2024 with a strong pricing profile. Current order entry pricing remains resilient, and we expect second half '23 volumes to be comparable to the first half 2023 shipments.\nWe also believe average pricing will remain elevated, but possibly drift 10% to 15% lower than average for the first half of the year. Not only a significant contributor itself our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates compared to our peers. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong second quarter despite price declines. After rising in the first quarter, scrap prices pulled back May through July with shredded scrap prices falling almost $100 a tonne.\nWe expect scrap pricing to fluctuate modestly during the second half of the year, perhaps seasonally rising somewhat in the third quarter and moderating again in the fourth. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills and our scrap generating customers.\nIn particular, our Mexican volumes competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap segregation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will preclude prime first scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide margin enhancement from the aluminum scrap streams and materially increased recycled content of our aluminum sheet products.\nOur steel operations achieved near record shipments of 3.2 million tonnes and solid financial results in the second quarter. Our steel production utilization rate, excluding Sinton was 93% compared to a domestic industry rate of 76%. Our higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles and is manifested by our value-added diversified product offerings, which amount to about 70% of our sales today, competitive advantage supply chain solutions, which is driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility, and the support of internal pull-through manufacturing volume.\nOur higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability. and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, backlogs are strong, and the customer order entry is good.\nAuto production is good with expectations of higher output in 2023 relative to 2022 rates and dealer inventories have improved, but still remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remains strong, our long product steel backlogs are solid. Onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. The turn down in residential construction seems to be abating. Oil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG, and solar continues to grow substantially.\nAt Sinton, the team achieved positive EBITDA for the second quarter and produced shy of 390,000 tonnes, which is about 52% of full capacity, which is obviously lower than we had planned. But that said, the team has done a phenomenal job to get to that EBITDA positive position. Some of that lack of utilization was being on a single electrical furnace for a portion of the quarter.\nAs we announced on July 1, we experienced equipment issues with the cast this year. Repairs are well underway, and we should be restarting within the next few days. Once we started, we fully expect to progressively ramp up month-over-month to an 80% run rate by the end of the year. The team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the mill.\nWe have 4 product dimensional capability. That has been proven all the way out to 84-inch down to the 057 and up to 1-inch think. Customers are reporting surface quality to be exceptional. Our strip mill design has allowed for the thermal mechanical rolling, allowing the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content and thus lower costs. Grade 80, grade 100 have been achieved, and we've been approved on and shipped some API grades. And it affirms our technical process choices, and there's no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice.\nWe have gained strong market acceptance and can sell everything we make and then sell. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies relative to our expansion into aluminum, responses from both current and new customers across all market sectors remains incredible. We are developing the mill site to colocate processing and consuming operations as we have successfully done in Sinton, and we have a number of customers already speaking with us about such opportunities, which would be a competitive and sustainably competitive model for all of us.\nTo recap the project. It's a 650,000 metric tonne aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, right across the highway essentially from our steel mill there. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both including body and the automotive arena and industrial sectors.\nSpecifically, we're targeting 300,000 tonnes of can, 200,000 tonnes of auto and 150,000 tonnes of industrial product. The on-site melt slab capacity of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. We are purchasing and we should be closing on land, both in San Luis Policy-central Mexico and also in the Southwest U.S. in the next 2 or 3 weeks.\nThe mill includes 2 cash lines for automotive, coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. All the principal equipment has been ordered, we anticipate rolling mill start up around mid-'25. The Mexico slabs center should be January 1, the '25 and the Southwest U.S. slab center sometime in the first quarter of the '25.\nTotal project cost, including the recycled slab centers should be $2.5 billion. 100% of that is going to be funded with cash. We expect to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA to the company through that investment, plus around $40 million to $50 million of additional earnings from the Omni recycling platform. And from an investment premise perspective, we just see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago.\nOld assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficiency and high-cost operations. significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit is existing today in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. And we see a real business alignment whereby we can leverage our core competencies of construction strength on operational know-how and our culture to truly leverage and exploit the technology.\nWe also will be able to leverage Omni's recyclement footprint and maximize recycled content of the product. We believe it's a very, very cost-effective, high return growth for us. And again, the existing and new customer interest and support is quite unbelievable.\nIn closing, we are excited. We're impassioned by the future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. And we're celebrating our 30th year in business this August, and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their commitment. And we are committed to them. I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. There's nothing more important.\nOur culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. As I said, I think, on the last call, we're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, which in turn, mitigates volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead.\nSo with that said, Holly, we would love to hand the call over to you and start the Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 20, 2023, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nThe other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, except, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses, as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q.\nYou also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports First Quarter 2023 Results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Good morning, everybody, and we certainly appreciate you all joining us for our first quarter earnings call today. As you read, once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter as highlighted by most importantly, a consecutive quarter of significant safety improvement. 82% of our facilities were incident free, and most importantly, our piece of focus appears to be minimizing severity rate.\nWe had record steel shipments of 3.3 million tonnes and adjusted EBITDA generation of a strong $950 million. [indiscernible] performance is showing improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter of '23, given the expectation of increased volumes. And we are also making great progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investment. There is great excitement within the prospective customer base for a new and innovative supply chain solution.\nAs always, I'm incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success. It is their culture of excellence and intentional diversification of our product portfolio that allows us to maintain higher utilization rates and maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles and producing superior financial metrics.\nHowever, for safety, great financial performance is of no importance without having our team safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource. But for us, for Steel Dynamics, they're more than that, they are family, and now number over 12,000 strong. We're focused to provide the very best for the health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level of the organization. With that focus, as I mentioned, the team's safety performance further improved in the first quarter '23, but there's more to do, and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries throughout our organization. So with that said, before I pursue the quarter, Theresa?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. It's great to join you. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong operational and financial performance this quarter. Our first quarter 2023 net income was $637 million or $3.70 per diluted share, which includes costs of about $77 million or $0.31 per diluted share associated with the start-up of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding those costs, first quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $691 million or $4.01 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2023 revenues of $4.9 billion were slightly higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume and increased metals recycling prices. Our first quarter operating income of $835 million was 10% higher than fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume. As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2023 and beyond, and we're focused toward a continued transformational growth initiatives.\nOur steel operations generated strong operating income of $345 million in the first quarter as record shipments of 3.3 million tons were partially offset by lower realized selling values. I also want to say congratulations to our Structural and Rail division as they had another record earnings quarter supported by a strong construction market.\nOur flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high-cost pig iron that was purchased in early 2022 during the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices, earnings were impacted by approximately $50 million in the first quarter, but we have worked through the higher-priced inventory now.\nOperating income from our metals recycling operations was $43 million, over threefold fourth quarter results due to increased demand driving higher prices and volume. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our Southern steel mills and driving profitability. Thanks to the Zimmer and Roca teams. We appreciate you. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements.\nOur steel fabrication operations achieved strong operating income in the quarter of $551 million, but lower than record fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonally lower shipments. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity. Specifically, our March order activity was extraordinarily strong. This is resulting in a strong order backlog extending into October and November of 2023. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong throughout the year, including the second half.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At March 31, we had record liquidity of $3.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we generated cash from operations of $734 million. We spent approximately $226 million on capital expenditures. We believe for the full year of 2023, capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-rolled mill investments.\nIn February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow and aligned with our growth strategy. We also purchased $354 million of our common stock, representing approximately 2% of our outstanding shares. At March 31, $980 million remained authorized for repurchase under our new plan.\nSince 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we repurchased $4.5 billion of our common stock, representing over 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and the consistently strong cash flow generation capability. We continue to be optimistic and confident in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nWe've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million to today's average of $2.6 billion. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated.\nWe're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized, long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. And I want to specifically thank the biocarbon solutions team in Columbus, Mississippi, they are doing a fantastic job, and we still hope to start operating this facility in early 2024.\nWe have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Before I hand the call back to Mark, for those of you that keep specific track of our flat-rolled shipments, in the first quarter, we had hot rolled and P&O shipments of 1.6 million. We had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Although there was some seasonality in shipping volume for fabrication, we saw yet another strong quarter, driven by the sustained market strength and an absolutely extraordinary execution by our team. Productivity of our operations is incredible. So thank you for the great job you all are doing up there. We continue to have high expectations for the fabrication business. We believe nonresidential construction markets will continue to be robust in the coming years.\nNonresidential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong throughout '23 and related spending has been significantly higher so far in '23 compared to last year at this time. To be continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and infrastructure spending programs should provide momentum for additional incremental construction spending. More real time, our customers tell us demand remains solid as confirmed by strong order entry rates, especially the most recent March order activity.\nSteel fabrication order backlog, as Theresa suggested, extend 7 to 8 months into October, November with strong pricing dynamics. Not only a significant contributor onto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Metals Recycling platform achieved a strong first quarter. Congratulations to them. They are on a path to higher volumes and increased metal margin.\nAfter 7 consecutive months of declining pricing in '22, ferrous scrap prices improved in December and throughout the first quarter, increasing well over $100 per gross ton. We expect scrap pricing to remain fairly steady at these higher levels based on increased seasonal North American steel mill demand in Q2 and Q3. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers.\nIn particular, our growing Mexican volumes enhance our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions and will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Metals Recycling team is working closely with both our Steel and Aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. Although residual shred one is just one example of that. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry, has demonstrated that innovation will provide ample ferrous and nonferrous scrap supply in the years ahead.\nOur steel operations achieved record quarterly shipments of 3.3 million tons and solid financial results in the first quarter. Steel production utilization rate, excluding Sinton, was 94% compared to a domestic industry rate of 75%. Higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Value-added diversified product offerings provide broad optionality across all market segments. Enhanced supply chain solutions is driving customer preference and were supported by the internal pull-through manufacturing volume.\nOur higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. March, in particular, was a very strong booking month for the steel platform. Auto is solid. Auto production is expected to increase in '23 over '22 rates and dealer inventories have improved, but still remain below historical norms.\nBuild rate in '22 was some 14.3 million units, and we expect '23 to show 15.1 and a little higher in '24. Nonresidential construction remains strong as evidenced by strong fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Long products are seasonally solid from a backlog perspective and onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. Residential construction has softened to some degree, but that erosion appears to be easing a little, but that segment tends to be a small part of our overall portfolio.\nOil and gas activity is very strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe, and solar continues to grow appreciably. At Sinton, we produced 420,000 tonnes of hot band in the quarter, which is 56% of eventual capacity. Shift and daily records were achieved in March, clearly demonstrating the mill's ability to reach the 3 million tons. As we discussed in our first quarter call, production through the quarter was impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and rolls needed for the Caster. This issue has now been resolved, and we expect a significant advance in productivity and earnings in Q2 and we should see the mill being EBITDA positive in Q2 for sure.\nWe believe full year capacity utilization could be in the range of 80% of rated capacity. The team has demonstrated -- clearly demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas steel mill. Full product dimensional capability has been proven. We have gone down to 50-ish and all the way up to 1 inch and all the way out to 84-inch width. The customers are reporting that the surface quality is absolutely exceptional. The hot strip mill design is allowed for thermo-mechanical rolling, which allows the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content with a significant reduction in production cost.\nGrade 80, Grade 100 has been achieved, and we've already been approved and shipped some API grades. In my mind, this affirms our technical on process choices, and there's no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice.\nWe certainly have gained strong market acceptance. Commercially, we can sell everything we make and then [indiscernible]. With the Caster segment issue resolved, we are able now to fully lever our heavy gauge wide capability. Our on-site customers are busy with 2 of them already expanding their capabilities. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, the market response from both current and new customers across our targeted market segments has been incredible. So to recap the project that's a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat-rolled facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, state-of-the-art facility, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors.\nWe produce roughly 300,000 metric tons of can sheet, 200,000 metric tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial alloy. On-site melt cast lab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons and that will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in Central Mexico. We've already purchased the property there, and we're pursuing a Southwest U.S. site as we speak. Technology will include 2 cash lines, coating lines and downstream processing and packaging. We've expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycle content. All the principal equipment is already on order, and we expect the roller mill to start up mid-'25; the Mexico slabs Center, the second half of '24; and in the Southwest slab Center, probably the first quarter of '25.\nTotal project cost, including the recycled slab centers is expected to be $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. As we've said in the past, the expectation is that somewhere between $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA for the aluminum project, plus likely $40 million to $50 million for Omni. I think it's a very, very compelling investment premise. We see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry, when we started SDI 30 years ago. It's predominantly old assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy cost. It's inefficient with high-cost operations.\nThe significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit exists in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. There is business alignment. We can leverage our core competencies of our construction strength and operational know-how and also lever Omni's recycling footprint as Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler today. SDI culture will drive high efficiency and low cost. Throughout the industry, there's a very steep cost curve, which is going to support margin. So very, very cost-effective, high-return growth initiative.\nWe're excited and passioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high return and growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in '22. We are arguably one of the top 5 steel producers in the world as measured by market cap and the third largest in North America relative to capacity. All these achievements in a relatively short time frame. We celebrated our 30th year in the business in '23 and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. And we are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority.\nOur culture and business model continue to positively differentiate on performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, in turn mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. And we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the many years ahead.\nAnd with that all said, I'd like to open the floor up for questions."

Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. And as I think you saw, operationally, our teams had a very, very, very solid fourth quarter. Our New Millennium Building Systems platform generated record steel fabrication earnings, Sinton is showing significant operating improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter of '23.\nOur new aluminum group is making great progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments, and I'll share more details later in the call. Relative to full year '22, the entire Steel Dynamics delivered an exceptional performance with record sales, earnings and cash flow generation. I think it was a tremendous achievement, and I'm incredibly proud of our team.\nThey are the foundation of our company, and they are the ones that have truly driven our success over the years. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles. However, none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource.\nBut for Steel Dynamics, they're more than that, they are a family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We are continually focused and provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times at every level, came in at top of mind in an active conversation at all levels through the organization. And with that focus, the team's safety performance improved significantly in 2022, but there's certainly more to do as we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries.\nBut before I add any more detail, Theresa, would you like to give us some detailed financial results.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Company Secretary, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team. We continue to hit new milestones throughout the company achieving record annual performance in 2022, with record revenues of $22.3 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of -- excuse me, record operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $3.9 billion or $2.92 per diluted share, and record cash flow from operations of $4.5 billion with EBITDA of $5.5 billion.\nAs Mark mentioned, is truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2022 results, net income was $635 million or $3.61 per diluted share which includes additional performance-based special compensation of $24 million or $0.09 per diluted share that was awarded to all nonexecutive eligible team members in recognition of their extraordinary performance. and costs of approximately $168 million or $0.67 per diluted share associated with our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill ramp.\nOur fourth quarter 2022 operating income declined 35% sequentially to $759 million due to lower realized selling values and seasonally lower shipments within our steel operations. which individually generate operating income of $178 million with shipments of 3 million tons in the fourth quarter. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high-cost pig iron that was purchased earlier in 2022 during the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nBased on current pig iron prices of $500 per ton versus our average cost incurred in the fourth quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by about $80 million. We expect to see that continue into the first quarter and the negative impact is likely to be around $60 million as we work through all the higher price pig iron before the end of the first quarter.\nFor the full year 2022, operating income from our steel operations was $3.1 billion, representing the second strongest year in our history, with record annual shipments of 12.2 million tons. Fourth quarter operating income from our metals recycling operations improved to $14 million based on increased volume and metal spread expansion despite lower average selling values.\nFor the full year 2022, operating income from our mills recycling operations was $130 million. Due to lower volume and average selling values, our spare scrap prices fell 9 out of 12 months during the year. It was sequentially lower than the record results in 2021.\nOur Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our Southern steel mills and driving profitability. I want to say a sincere thank you to the Zimmer and Roka team. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills which improves furnace efficiency, lowers cost and reduces company-wide working capital needs.\nAnd once again, our steel fabrication operations achieved record quarterly operating income of $682 million as metal spreads continue to expand based on steady product pricing and lower steel input costs, which more than offset the impact of seasonally lower shipments. Steel joist and deck remains solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog which extends through the first half of 2023.\nOur steel fabrication platform also achieved another record year in 2022, with operating income of $2.4 billion eclipsing last year's record of $365 million, congratulations to the entire team, well done. This demonstrates the power of our circular manufacturing model and the natural hedge our steel fabrication business provides to steel price shifts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion due to strong results in the release of working capital. For the full year, we generated a record $4.5 billion, our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.4 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion.\nDuring 2022, we invested $909 million in capital investments of which over half related to ongoing construction of our 4 new flat-rolled coating lines and our aluminum flat-rolled mill investments. For 2023, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our flat-rolled coating lines.\nSince our last call, we also announced the location for our aluminum rolling mill as Columbus, Mississippi. Mark will share the strategy of the location later in the call. We're also incredibly pleased to have received near-term state incentives for the project of $250 million with meaningful additional tax benefits to occur over the next 15 years. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend of $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter of 2022. We also repurchased $413 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we paid cash dividends of $237 million and repurchased $1.8 billion or 12% of our outstanding shares, representing a 53% net income shareholder distribution rate. At the end of the year, $1.3 billion remains available under our current share authorization program.\nSince 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 119% and we've repurchased $4.2 billion of our common stock, representing 31% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability, and the continued optimism and confidence in our future.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics.\nOur free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million between 2011 and 2015 to $2.6 billion today between 2018 and 2022. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investment with available cash and cash flow from operations.\nWe also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we've clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment.\nWe're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we're excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers.\nOur sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with an intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward.\nAs I conclude my remarks, I know there's some of you that follow more detail of our flat-rolled shipments. So for the fourth quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 959,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 109,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1.1 million tons. Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thank you, Theresa. Well, as was mentioned, steel fabrication saw phenomenal results in the platform in the year. And again, thank you to the phenomenal team. I think their effectiveness and their efficiency and their output per employee exceeds anyone in the industry. So congratulations to you all and thank you for all you do there. It was another record quarterly performance, and record annual operating income of $2.4 billion for the year, with record shipments of 856,000 tons.\nAlthough the macro industries remain a little mixed, we believe nonresidential construction markets are and will continue to remain strong throughout the year. Despite lower ABI indications, I believe overall architectural firms remain optimistic for '23 and Dodge Momentum Index improved around about 6% in December. And nonresidential starts and build rates are also forecast to remain solid through the year. And I think the continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the infrastructure spending programs will start kicking in that will continue to provide momentum for construction spending.\nMore relevant, I think our customers certainly tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty, and it's certainly confirmed by current order rates, not only in the joist and deck business but also our structural products business as well.\nOur steel fabrication order backlog extends through the first half of '23, with strong pricing dynamics. And with continued solid order intake rates, we expect to see continued strong volume and performance from those operations throughout 2023. And the fabrication platform is not only a significant contributor itself, but it provides significant pull-through volume for our steel mills, allowing higher through-cycle utilization rates, and it also provides a meaningful natural hedge to lower steel pricing. Our metals recycling platform had a solid year, especially in light of the challenging pricing environment.\nDuring 2022, ferrous scrap prices declined 9 out of 12 months and volumes were marginally lower. The team managed to achieve metal margins that were only $2 per gross ton lower than record 2021 results.\nAfter 7 consecutive months of declining price during '22 ferrous scrap prices improved in December and January, and it's our expectation that pricing will continue a moderate seasonal increase during the first quarter. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our EAF steel mills and our scrap generating customers.\nIn particular, our growing Mexican volumes will enhance our Columbus and Sinton positions and the Zimmer and Roka acquisitions are performing very well, and the integration is outstanding. Our metals recycling team continues to partner with our steel teams to expand traded scrap separation to provide more high-quality, low-residual scrap to our steel mills.\nThe impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry, has demonstrated that innovation will provide ample scrap supply in the years ahead. Similarly, we're also exploring technologies for more effective aluminum scrap separation in anticipation of sourcing material for our upcoming aluminum flat rolled operations to maximize recycled content.\nOur steel operations achieved record shipments in the second best annual earnings in '22, again, outstanding performance by an outstanding team. So thank you for each and every one of you there. Record shipments of 12.2 million tons, operating income of $3.1 billion. Our '22 steel production utilization rate was 92%, excluding Sinton, compared to a domestic industry rate of 78%. And again, our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles.\nOur value-added diversified product offerings, differentiated supply chain solutions provides stickiness and the support of our internal pull-through manufacturing volume has clearly demonstrated time and time again that we can maintain a higher utilization than our peers in the industry, it's a higher -- it was a key differentiator. It supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. In actuality, December was a historically high order intake month followed by another historic high order intake year-to-date.\nSo we see a very, very, very solid market developing for the rest of the year. Auto production is expected to increase in '23 from the lower '22 rates. Dealer inventories have improved, but still remain meaningfully below historic norms. The build rate in '22 was roughly 14.3 million units, and it's expected to grow a little to about 15, 15.1 for 2023 and higher thereafter. Nonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog, and as I said, the long product steel volumes.\nResidential construction has certainly softened. It's impacting HVAC, appliance and other housing-related products, but fortunately, much of our portfolio is biased toward replacement. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow. And I think generally, this market strength is clearly supporting market price appreciation. And in particular, the challenges with AHMSA in Mexico has certainly changed the regional sort of markets and the Mexico tons stand in Mexico and the U.S. market is certainly benefiting from that.\nIn Sinton, the downstream coating lines are running well. They are running below full capacity, though, as the rest of the mill continues to work through start-up items. The hot mill, and that's the good news, the hot mills turned the corner, running more consistency, approaching 65% capability month to date. We've been experiencing very, very long sequence lengths on the Caster recently up to 22 hours at a time. We're achieving days in excess of 85% capacity, and we should be around about 150,000 tons for the month of January and improving thereafter.\nOur current utilization is certainly being impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and rolls. This is specific to the Caster rolls in the segments. But we expect to have this resolved before the end of the first quarter, which will allow for a much stronger production for the rest of the year.\nAdditionally, high-priced pig iron inventory is being drawn through -- drawn down through the quarter and raw material input costs were normalized for Q2 through the rest of the year. While financial performance will likely be flat there in the first quarter as we consume that high-price pig iron, we expect significant events in both productivity and earnings in Q2.\nMill production dimensional capabilities improving there. The hot strip mill design has certainly allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content and associated alloy cost, and we've already been approved and shipped some API grades.\nI think experience to date certainly affirms our technical and process choices, and there's no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace based flat-rolled steel technology of choice going forward. We continue to grow, our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies.\nWe have the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines under construction. These projects have gone well, and they're targeted for start-up in the second half of 2023. We have a galvanizing line and paint line going in at Sinton and similarly into Heartland, and we're seeing very good customer interest for that new volume.\nCurrently, we're the largest domestic nonautomotive coater of flat-rolled steel with an annual coating capacity over 6 million tons. These 4 new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always fully utilized with our highest margin products.\nSwitching to aluminum, market response from both current and new customers across all market sectors has truly been incredible. To recap, the project itself, it's a 650,000 metric ton per year aluminum flat-rolled facility. The main mill facility will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. It's close to the Southeastern markets and well positioned to serve Mexico. It's on the KCS rail line, which connects us again to Mexico to bring slab up and material back down to Mexico, and it also connects to Canada to bring primary aluminum down from the sources up there.\nWe intentionally located it on the TVA power grid to allow supply green energy. And we have water access by the Tombigbee Waterway. So the transportation structure is good for us. We obtained a very attractive incentive package. And having our current -- our Columbus steel mill close by, it allows us to draw on that facility for talent, for professional services, and there'll be a transition or transfer of many of our folks there which will allow an immediate infusion of our culture to that aluminum facility. So we're excited about that.\nThe mill itself will have on-site melt cast slab capacity of roughly 600,000 metric tons and will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. One will be located in the Southwest U.S. and one in SLP Mexico, both sites we have letters of intent in place, and we're under due diligence, but I believe they will serve us very, very, very well. And obviously, the strategic thought there was to place the slab centers in areas of surplus scrap and the California Western market and Mexico will have an abundance of UBC material.\nThe mill itself, again, is going to be equipped with the 2 cache lines, a coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We've actually expanded the product scope there to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize recycled content. It's a state-of-the-art facility, and we'll be serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both body and TAM, the automotive sector and industrial sectors.\nBreakdown would be 300,000 tons of can sheet, 200,000 tons of auto and about 150,000 tons of industrial, all the principal equipment is on order, allowing for a pretty firm startup of the mill mid-2025. We believe the Mexican slab center will start up in the second half of '24 and the Southwest U.S. slab center early 2025.\nThe total project cost, including the recycled slab centers has grown a little from our initial $2.2 billion estimate. The increase is somewhat associated with -- now that we've truly defined the equipment costs. But we've also added scope. As I said, we put in scrap processing and treatment and segregation at both the slab centers, which has increased that number a little.\nAnd today, we estimate a firm budget of about $2.5 billion. It will be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. So there's no additional debt or financial needed to push this thing forward. And we clearly expect to see about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, with an additional $40 million to $50 million arising from our recycled OmniSource efforts.\nFrom an investment premise and we've talked about it before, but we see the aluminum market, not unlike that in the steel industry, when we started SDI some 30 years ago. It's an industry that has essentially older assets. There's been little reinvestment over the years, heavy legacy cost. There's inefficiency and sort of high-cost operations.\nAnd the advantage compared to any other steel market that we've entered is there's actually a supply side deficit. Every other market in steel has always been oversupplied, and we've had to use our culture and low-cost strategies to penetrate those markets.\nWith aluminum, there's a clear, clear supply deficit, will certainly aid the ramp-up and a very, very quick profitability of that project. There is certainly business alignment. We believe it's sort of an adjacent industry, so to speak. It's going to allow us to leverage our core competencies of constructing design, constructing, ramping up very, very large capital assets.\nIt will allow us to leverage our recycling footprint, OmniSource is the largest North American recycling of nonferrous products, including aluminum. We recycle over 1.2 billion pounds, half of that is aluminum today. I believe we will certainly be able to infuse the project with our culture, and that will power a very low cost, very high efficiency operations.\nWe are very, very excited and we're certainly excited from the reception we're getting from those aluminum customers. Looking forward, we're certainly excited and passioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years.\nWe were recently added to the S&P 500 Index. I feel that's a true testament to our people and to the financial strength and maturity of our company. We're arguably 1 of the top 5 steel producers in the world as measured by market cap today, and the third largest in North America by capacity. We certainly have the best financial metrics of any of our peers.\nAnd all these achievements have been achieved in a relatively short time frame, and that could not be accomplished without the phenomenal commitment of our extraordinary people. Everyone has had an impact and everyone contributes each and every day. We were celebrating our 30th year in business later this year, and there are only better things to come. Teams and the culture they create are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication.\nAnd in turn, we are committed to their welfare, their health and their safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority each and every day. Our success is also driven by the loyal support of our customers who have become partners and friends over the years. And together, we have created many innovative supply chain solutions, creating value for all.\nWe look forward to providing similar value and optionality to all our new customers as we continue to expand our product offerings in the steel arena, but also in the new aluminum market that we're entering. And finally, thank you to all that have invested in us. There's a growing number that is recognizing the power of our culture, the resilience of our business model and the potential outsized depreciation that are significant yet disciplined growth will return. We certainly look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. And so with that said, would love to open the floor up or the call up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised this call is being recorded today, October 20, 2022, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Ali. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics' Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently.\nSuch statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q.\nYou'll also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled, Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2022 results.\nAnd now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. I forgot to turn the microphone on there as always. But thank you, everyone, for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. It certainly was an exciting quarter with great performance by the team and growth on many fronts.\nFirstly, a great welcome to the ROCA team, centered in Monterrey. In combination with the former Zimmer Group, OmniSource Mexico, now is a significant recycling presence within Mexico that will support their existing Mexican customer base while providing strategic sourcing opportunities for our Sinton and Columbus steel mills and soon to be aluminum mill.\nSinton has turned the corner and is showing significant improvement. The team is also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled strategy, which I will share later on the call.\nOperationally, our third quarter was a great quarter, achieving several new benchmarks, including record steel and steel fabrication shipments and record cash flow from operations, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to further expansion of shareholder value.\nI continue to be incredibly proud of our teams. They are our foundation and the catalyst of our current and future success. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through the cycle.\nSo a great quarter, yet none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often employees are described as a company's most important resource. For us, they are more than that. They are family and the SDI family now is 26,000 strong. We are focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare.\nWe're actively engaged in safety at all times at every level of our organization, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation throughout the company. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 incidents.\nBut before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some details?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Company Secretary, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and personal congratulations to the team on another strong operational and financial performance.\nOur third quarter 2022 net income was $914 million or $5.03 per diluted share, inclusive of costs of $111 million or $0.43 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $992 million or $5.46 per diluted share.\nThird quarter revenues of $5.7 billion declined 9% sequentially based on lower flat-rolled steel and scrap pricing. Our third quarter 2022 operating income was $1.2 billion, lower than sequential results due to lower pricing and resulting metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations.\nOur steel operations generated solid operating income of $658 million in the third quarter, with record shipments, as Mark mentioned, at 3.2 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 268,000 tons. Sequential earnings were significantly lower due to the previously mentioned metal spread compression within our flat-rolled steel businesses. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion as average scrap cost declined more than product pricing in the quarter. In fact, our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions each achieved record earnings. Congratulations to those teams.\nThird quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations declined to $10 million as ferrous pricing declined month-over-month through the quarter, resulting in significant metal margin compression. But the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. I also give my welcome to the ROCA team.\nA huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record third quarter operating income of $677 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, record shipments and lower steel input costs. Steel joists and deck demands remained solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog, which extends well through the first half of 2023.\nWe generated record cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the third quarter as strong results and release of working capital benefited cash flow. Year-to-date 2022, we've generated a record $3.3 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly low-cost variable cost structure. At the end of September, we had record liquidity of $3.2 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion.\nYear-to-date 2022, we funded $565 million in capital investments. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be close to $400 million, of which about $200 million is related to our recently announced aluminum flat-rolled investments, with much of the remaining capital related to our 4 new flat-rolled coating lines that will be located in Sinton and Heartland.\nWe maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter. We also repurchased $482 million of our common stock in the third quarter representing over 3% of our outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we paid cash dividends of $177 million and repurchased $1.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares, representing a 48% net income distribution ratio. At the end of the third quarter, $245 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization.\nThese actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while remaining dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nOur recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth, strong shareholder returns and maintain investment-grade metrics.\nOur cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions as we clearly demonstrated in the third quarter. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation.\nSustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we're excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility will decrease our steel Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25%.\nWe have an actionable path to our carbon neutrality that is more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward.\nIn conclusion, I know some of you track the details behind our flat-rolled shipments. And so for the quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 951,000 tons; cold rolled of 139,000 tons; and finally, coated flat-rolled products of 1,102,000 tons, for a total of 2,192,000 tons of flat-rolled shipments. Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thank you, Theresa. And certainly, incredible results from the steel fabrication platform, a product that is obviously a market tailwind, but our strategic positioning over the years. We had record operating income of $677 million in the quarter with record shipments of 218,000 tons.\nNonresidential construction markets remain strong as would be suggested by the macro indicators. They all remain positive. ABI index of a little over 53. AAA reports business conditions remain generally strong, and Dodge Momentum Index improved 6% in September.\nNonresidential starts and build rates of forecast to remain good into 2023. More importantly, our customers tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty. Order activity is better paced versus the frenetic pace of the recent past and remains higher than historical norms.\nOur order backlog is well into the first half of 2023 with strong pricing dynamics, and we expect to see continued strong volume for fabrication in the fourth quarter and for 2023 in general.\nAside from the significant advantage of pull-through volume for our sheet mills, New Millennium provides a perfect hedge to our steel operations. Although SDI mills saw steady utilization throughout the third quarter, lower domestic steel industry utilization in general reduced the demand for scrap in the quarter. First, scrap prices have declined month-over-month beginning in May through October. Prime dropping from some $735 a ton to more recently around about $380 per gross ton.\nOmni's earnings suffered as a result of this progression in market pricing and weaker industry demand. The Omni platform is continuing to work with our steel mill teams to expand our shred separation opportunities to provide even higher volumes of low residual scrap. The impact of our efforts, along with others in the industry, has amply demonstrated our view that innovation will solve any perceived fears of prime scrap shortage in the years ahead.\nWith additional producers coming to the market, pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to a little over $500 per ton. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year. Supply is not an issue for our flat rolled operations. And again, we're excited for the addition of ROCA to our OmniSource Mexico portfolio, which now will grow to some 2.5 million tons of ferrous and nonferrous annual capability.\nIt was another historically strong quarter for the steel platform. We had record shipments of 3.2 million tons and operating income of $658 million. Our third quarter production utilization rate was around 93%, which was incrementally lower than the second quarter that was 95%, yet significantly above the industry average of 78.\nHigh utilization rates are clearly demonstrated through time. Value-added diversified product offerings, differentiated supply chain solutions all support -- and the support of internal pull-through volume all support that utilization -- higher utilization rate compared to our peers. And in turn, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics.\nLooking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid, and that's supported by our diversified portfolio of value-added products, which comprised now of around 70% of steel sales. We focus on value-creating supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility. And all this just maintains a higher through-cycle utilization rate.\nRelative to the markets, we see automotive steady at current rates, and we expect that to improve off low 2022 production based on the extremely low dealer inventories and pent-up vehicle demand. The '22 build rate is going to be some 14.5 million units, and we would expect '23 to grow to 15.5 units or so, and 2024 to 16-plus million units.\nNonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Our long product steel backlogs are good and several of our divisions, Columbia City and Roanoke in particular, achieved strong volumes and record earnings in the third quarter, demonstrating our market depth. Infrastructure spending should also provide further meaningful support in the coming years.\nNew residential construction has softened a little impacting HVAC and appliance and other housing-related products. Fortunately, our portfolio is biased to replacement, and we won't get a ton of a ton impact. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe, and solar renewable expansion continues to grow.\nTurning to Sinton. Both the coating lines are running extremely well, and ramp-up continues on the hot side in the tandem cold mill. I believe the hot mill has certainly turned the corner becoming more consistently running at a 60%, 65% month-to-date with days exceeding well over 80%.\nSurface quality is excellent. Reported coil shape from processing customers is also excellent. And our hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing higher strength grades with lower alloy content and associated costs. And we've already been approved and shipped some API grades, which is quite remarkable given the mill has only been up and running for what, 9 months. So the team has done a phenomenal job. And I think it certainly affirms our technical and process choices and it is indeed a next-generation mill.\nOur exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash allocation strategies and growth. The 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are going well and are targeted for the second half of 2023 for startup, 2 for Sinton and 2 for Heartland, and we're already seeing customer interest for that new volume.\nWe're the largest domestic nonautomotive coater of flat-rolled steel with an annual coating capacity over 6 million tons. These 4 new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons.\nWe have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always full with our highest margin products.\nRelative to the Roll Dynamics, the market response from both current and new customers across all market sectors has been absolutely incredible. And so to recap that project, it's a 650000-metric-ton-a-year aluminum flat rolled facility, which will be located in the Southeastern U.S. and we expect to announce that site location in the next few weeks.\nOn-site melt and cast slab capacity will consist of 450,000 metric tons, and that will be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest U.S. and one in the South.\nWe'll have 2 cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging lines. So we'll be able to furnish all products to the beverage -- food packaging arena, automotive and industrial. The mill is planned to start up mid-2025, the Mexico Slabs Center in 2024 and the Southwest Lab Center in the first quarter of '25.\nThe financial impact will be around $2.2 billion CapEx over 4 years. It's going to be funded 100% with available cash and cash flow from operations with no additional debt needed. We expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA once it's up and running.\nSo in closing, we're excited and passioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have demonstrated over the last 15 years. Our teams are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their desire to excel.\nWe are committed to the health and safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continues to positively differentiate our performance from others. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today and in the years ahead.\nSo with that said, we would love to answer any questions you might have."

Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, David. Thank you, everyone, for being with us on our second call this week. It's been -- it was exciting to announce our new growth initiative on Tuesday with our entry into the aluminum market. And it's only been, I think probably just 48 hours or so, and the customer response from all 3 market segments, whether it be distribution processes, whether it be the packaging industry or even automotive, it's been absolutely staggering, the early sign of affirmation of us getting into the marketplace, and I think speaks to the lack of supply and optionality within that market. So that's exciting.\nAnd it's as exciting and even more exciting to announce yet another record quarter, record consolidated volumes, earnings per share, cash flow, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to build shareholder value. Specifically, we repurchased $517 million worth of the company's common stock, representing 3.5% of our outstanding shares in the quarter. So we're staying true to our repurchase programs.\nWe are certainly beneficiary of a strong market tailwind, but I'm incredibly proud of our 11,000 strong team. They are the foundation and the catalyst of our success. They are the ones driving the superior results. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last 10 years that allows us to exploit the current market and will continue to produce higher lows and higher highs through the cycle.\nI've said it many times before, but none of this matters without keeping everyone safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important asset. For us, they are more than that. They're part of the SDI family, the people, and we are always striving to provide the best for their health, their safety and for the welfare. We're actively focused on safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level within the organization. We're certainly better than industry averages, but we're not going to rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 incidents. We're continuing to see material market share gains driven by our ESG profile, an industry-leading low carbon footprint for flat-rolled products. We will continue our journey to environmental excellence through a defined and achievable plan to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our recent Aymium investment and our joint venture is a perfect example of that. It's an exciting opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through renewable biomass replacing fossil fuels in our electric arc furnaces. We have tested the product and it works beautifully. We believe it will also work within our iron operations. Initially, it will be 160,000 metric tons per year, and the CapEx is estimated to be around $125 million to $150 million. It will reduce our Scope 1 steelmaking greenhouse gas intensity by some 20%, 25% with even further potential upside from the use of the biogas. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to give us some thoughts?\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Company Secretary, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As Mark said, what an incredible week. We announced our aluminum strategy on Tuesday, and now we're sharing our record results. I can see personal things relate to the entire SDI family. Your performance resulted in record sales, earnings and cash flow, a truly exceptional performance.\nOur second quarter 2022 net income was $1.2 billion or $6.44 per diluted share, inclusive of cost of $77 million or $0.29 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion or $6.73 per diluted share.\nRevenues improved across all of our platforms to a record $6.2 billion, driven by record steel shipments and record pricing volume in our steel fabrication business. Our second quarter 2022 record operating income of $1.6 billion improved 8% versus first quarter results, driven by record steel fabrication earnings.\nOur steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter with record shipments of 3.1 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 171,000 tons.\nSequential earnings were 5% lower due to metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations as realized pricing declined and average scrap costs increased. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion resulting from rising product prices. In fact, we set quarterly record shipments at our Structural, Engineer Bar and Roanoke Bar divisions.\nSecond quarter operating income for our metals recycling operations remained strong at $58 million, representing a 20% sequential quarterly improvement as ferrous metal margin and volume improved. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and mills recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record second quarter operating income of $599 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, coupled with record shipments. Steel joist and deck demand remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength in our order backlog, which remains at near record levels and contain strong forward pricing.\nBased on the strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure.\nAt the end of June, we had record liquidity of $2.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.3 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1 billion in the second quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date.\nDuring the first half of 2022, we have funded $323 million in capital investments. For the second half of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be approximately $350 million to $400 million, the majority of which relate to our 4 new flat roll coating lines to be located in Sinton and Heartland.\nWe maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing it 31% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased $906 million or 6.5% of our outstanding shares. At the end of the second quarter, $727 million remained available under our most recent share repurchase authorization. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143%, and we have repurchased $3.2 billion of our common stock, representing 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with the shareholder distributions comprised of a positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nOur recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged strategy. As I mentioned on Tuesday's call, our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years. We will readily fund this investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth, strong shareholder returns and maintain investment-grade metrics. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation.\nSustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, as Mark mentioned, we're very excited to -- that we formed our joint venture with Aymium recently, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. Steel Dynamics owns 55% of the joint venture, and we're the operating partner.\nWe have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward.\nMark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. As you saw, absolutely incredible results from the New Millennium fabrication platform, record operating income of $599 million in Q2 on record 218,000 tons of shipments. We see the nonresidential construction markets remaining strong. Despite the caution emanating from Amazon's message for next year, we have had reaffirmation from our major customers anyway, including warehouse customers that everything remains incredibly strong going forward into 2023. Cloud-based computing, data centers, pharma and schools are all strong. Although the ABI index may have drifted slightly month-over-month, the AI reports, ongoing order activity and architectural firms as well as new work online remains very strong.\nFor us, order input activity remains robust, and we still have near-peak backlog persisting. So that's a very, very good position to be in. Q3 earnings from fabrication will certainly increase. We're going to see increased shipments and metal spread expansion from both increased selling values and lower steel input costs. And as you've seen, this is a -- it's providing a perfect hedge to softening steel prices.\nAlthough we mentioned his impending retirement on our Q1 call, Russ Rinn had his final official day in the office last week after about 11 years of dedicated commitment to SDI and the OmniSource recycling platform. And yes, it's -- people say it's sweet and sour, but for me, it was tough to see him go.\nHe repositioned OmniSource to record earnings last year, dramatically influenced their safety performance over the years and has been a key contributor to the strategic moves we've made as a company. Right now, he hiking in Virginia. And mate, thank you very much for everything you've done.\nThe recycled platform saw stronger earnings based on higher domestic steel industry utilization pushing demand up, drove higher shipment volume, pricing and associated metal spread. After a strong downward move in prime scrap relative to shred through the quarter, that spread is normalized and pricing is expected to remain more stable in the months ahead.\nThe Omni platform is continuing to work with the steel melt teams to further expand our shred segregation to provide higher volumes of low residual shred scrap, which continues to reduce our dependence on more expensive prime grades. Pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to low $50 per ton range. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year, and supply is not an issue.\nAnd the rumors of us having problems with fast levels and such is totally inaccurate. There's no problem using the Brazilian pig iron that we're bringing into our mills.\nSteel operations had another terrific quarter, record shipments of 3.1 million tons, strong operating income of $1.1 billion. Our second quarter production utilization rate was 95%, certainly above the industry average of some 82%. And I think we clearly communicated in the past that higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated over time.\nOur strategy of the value-add diversified product offerings and coming out with differentiated supply chains support that, along with our internal support from fabrication and downstream. Altogether, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability.\nOur customer order entry remains strong. Support of value-added products is certainly a part of that. And as I said, we've intentionally grown that value-added steel product mix and created valuable supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, some 70% of our steel sales are value added. This supports our continued best-in-class financial metrics and cash generation.\nSpecifically to the markets, we expect the automotive arena to remain strong and probably improve as the chip issue mitigates. We still have extremely low dealer inventories and a very strong pent-up vehicle demand from the consumer base.\n'22 build rate, there'll be some, I don't know, around about 14 million units, and it's projected to grow to 16.4 million in '23 and perhaps 16.8 million in 2024. I think the chip shortage actually for us is a good thing. It's effectively extending the auto cycle and just given us a market that's going to be strong for longer.\nConstruction remains strong as evidenced with the fabrication backlog. Our last products steel backlogs are also strong and several of our divisions recorded record earnings and volume in the second quarter, demonstrating the market's depth. Infrastructure is a further meaningful support.\nHigh demand continues for HVAC, appliance and other related products. Energy continues to improve. We're getting large orders in the South. I think it's significant to note that the import arrivals that the sort of Ukraine-Russia conflict drove early in the year, those are arriving now, but there's very, very little import interest for sort of October, November, December. And I believe we're going to see moderated import volumes in the second half. And significantly, it appears our hot-rolled coil order input rate has improved dramatically in the last week or so, showing signs of an inflection there.\nTurning to Sinton. Commissioning continues on the hot side and tandem cold mill. The rest of the mill is fully operational. The hot mill has established target volume throughput rates with an average run rate of 75% to 80%. And I just want to emphasize that, that is when we are running, we're running at that rate.\nSurface quality is excellent and it's proven to be superior to both our Columbus and our Butler facilities. The hot strip mill design is allowed for thermomechanical rolling. That's allowing higher strength grades to be produced at lower alloy content. The reported coil shape from our processes is excellent. And so in total, it affirms the technical process capability of the equipment and affirms the design decisions that were made some years ago for the mill.\nWe are wrestling a little with uptime in July. We have a substation arcing issue that should be resolved this week. We have some unique Texas power supply issues right now. And we are seeing some miscellaneous equipment failures that are typical of commissioning an integrated line. The supply chain is aggravating that a little bit because when you have a -- when you need a part instead of getting it in a matter of hours, sometimes it takes a day or 2. So we are wrestling with those alligators, not atypical of a start-up of new plant, but we expect substantial resolution of these issues over the next few weeks.\nSo the July issue may have cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons of production for the year, we think, to (inaudible) itself because July is not over yet, but certainly moving in the right direction, and we clearly expect to be EBITDA positive in the Q4.\nWe continue on our growth. We have the 4 value-added coating lines under construction and progressing well. They're targeted for the second half of 2023 to start up. As you know, we -- again, it's the strength of our overall strategy and our product mix, but we are the largest nonautomotive coater of flat rolled steels, and now have annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. The 4 new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We've created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, and these lines are almost always fully utilized with our highest-margin products.\nSo switching now to aluminum dynamics. It's been an incredibly exciting week, and it has been incredible. I said it earlier, it's been staggering, the initial support that we're seeing from all our customers and a massive number of new customers.\nTo recap, it's a 650,000 metric ton a year flat-rolled facility that's going to be located in the Southeastern U.S. It have on-site melt and cast lab capacity of roughly 450,000 metric tons. It's a fully equipped flat-rolled mill with 2 cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging capability. It's going to be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, 1 in the Southwest U.S. and 1 in Mexico. And we expect the mill itself to start up in the first half of '25, the Mexican slab casting center in 2024 and the Southwest slap casting center in -- at the end of 2025.\nThe financial impact a total project cost of some $2.2 billion. That expenditure is going to be spread over 4 years of the project. It's going to be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow through operations, and it's expected to add a good $650 million to $700 million in through-cycle consolidated annual EBITDA per year. And we certainly anticipate no requirement to add any additional debt.\nFrom conversations on the call and subsequent conversations there appears to be some skepticism regarding our EBITDA per ton target of $1,000. We are confident of that number. And it speaks to what was driven by a myriad of things, but firstly, it's a greenfield facility. Everything is happening essentially on one side or the rolling process and coding, heat treating. It allows for an optimum site layout and flow of material and logistics, and you can quite easily reduce the labor, the man power input because of that and with robotics and automatic storage and retrievable systems.\nSo labor input is going to be dramatically less than the current industry. We will not be burdened by aged facilities and legacy costs. Energy, because of the -- just the state-of-the-art equipment that we be installing is going to be a lot lower. Yield improvements will dramatically improve the cost structure, pushing higher scrap content levels and transportation, given the satellite slab casting centers transporting solid dense slab as opposed to scrap is going to be a significant improvement. So we're very, very confident of that cost projection.\nFrom an investment premise standpoint, obviously, we see a very clear gap in the supply and demand. There's a current and growing deficit -- supply deficit. We see a very close sort of overlap and business alignment. And essentially, you could -- if we filmed the steel mill and an aluminum mill in black and white, most people on the call today wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I mean it's -- all it is, is a different metal. We clearly will be able to execute the project well.\nIt's incredibly cost-effective growth. Given the opportunities that are in the marketplace today, and the exorbitant multiples that are expected from sellers. This is a very, very CapEx efficient growth project.\nAs I said, we have got absolutely great customer support. And at the end of the day, our success has always been driven by the SDI culture by our employees. It drives higher efficiency than anyone else, it drive lower cost. And if you look at that industry, it has a very, very, very steep cost curve. And that will obviously -- if you were at the lowest quartile, that's going to support margin through the cycle. So we're incredibly excited by the opportunity.\nSo in general, it's been a phenomenal week. It's been a phenomenal year for SDI that will continue through the rest of this year. Our team provides our success, the foundation for that success, and I thank each of them for their hard work and their commitment. I remind each and everyone to remember, safety is always our first priority. We're going to continue to focus on providing superior value for our customers, through our company, team members and shareholders alike, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead.\nSo with that said, I'd like to pass the call over for questions. Holly?"

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 21, 2022, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Lipschitz\n\nThank you, Holly.\nGood morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today.\nLeading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on this call individually.\nSome of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently.\nSuch statements involve risks and uncertainties related to our steel, metals recycling and our fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions.

Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as always, we appreciate and value your time with us this morning. Record results are of no importance if our teams did not remain safe. So before beginning this morning, I want to pause for a moment to acknowledge a recent workplace fatality that occurred at our Heartland Flat Roll division. We are deeply saddened, our thoughts and prayers reside with his family and friends.\nThe reason I always begin our calls with a topic of safety is because it can never be overemphasized. Safety is our #1 value and first priority. Nothing is more important than sustaining a safe environment for our employees.\nWe must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members. We must actively think about safety at all times, keeping it top of mind, an active conversation. Simply, safety comes before everything. And with this backdrop, it's difficult to celebrate an otherwise phenomenal performance. But we're here this morning to share what the team accomplished in the first quarter and to congratulate them.\nTheir record performance this quarter was another extraordinary achievement driven by the commitment, innovation and passion of our people, executing on our long-term strategies of diversified value-adding growth. I thank the whole team, the entire team for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. We're committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, and have been since our founding.\nWe have always been and continue to be a leader in production of sustainable low-carbon emission steel products. We encourage the use of new technologies and processes to reduce our impact on the environment, including a strategic focus on carbon emissions mitigation with a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nOur sustainability strategy is an ongoing journey. We are starting from a leadership position within the industry and plan to stay there by doing even more. But before I continue with more market commentary, Theresa will share insights into our performance.\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Company Secretary, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. It's exciting to continue to see all the new milestones being continually reached throughout the company. A personal thanks to our teams and congratulations. Your performance resulted in another record quarter for Steel Dynamics with net income of $1.1 billion or $5.71 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022.\nIn the quarter, we incurred cost of $84 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the continued commissioning start-up of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $6.02 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2022 record revenues of $5.6 billion and record operating income of $1.5 billion were both 5% higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and continued strong performance in our steel and metals recycling operations.\nWe also achieved record quarterly cash flow from operations of $819 billion (sic) [$819 million] and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a truly exceptional performance. We see positive industry fundamentals for at least the remainder of 2022 and believe our second quarter 2022 results could achieve yet another new record performance.\nOur steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, achieving record shipments of 2.9 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 50,000 tons. Earnings from our steel operations were 15% lower than sequential record fourth quarter results related to metal spread compression and our flat-roll steel operations as realized pricing declined more than raw material costs.\nIn contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion based on rising product prices. Despite hitting record volumes, we still have additional steel shipping capacity, much of which is within the long product steel group. When Sinton is fully operational, it will contribute an additional 750,000 tons per quarter of availability.\nOperating income from our mills recycling operations for the first quarter were strong at $48 million, based on improved metal margins as both average ferrous and nonferrous pricing improved in the quarter. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide raw material working capital requirements.\nMark will expand on the meaningful benefit of our steel and metals recycling teams working together to reduce our cost of raw materials as well. A huge congratulations to our steel fabrication team. They almost doubled their previous record results, achieving a new record high quarterly operating income of $467 million, eclipsing the entire full year of 2021 results by almost 30% in just 1 quarter. These earnings were driven by record pricing supported by near-record shipments of 210,000 tons.\nSteel joist and deck order activity remains incredibly strong. Our steel fabrication business continues to operate with a record backlog considering both forward product pricing and volumes, which currently extends through the first quarter of 2023. Based on this strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses.\nOur cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model. At the end of March, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully undrawn unsecured revolver.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we generated record cash flow from operations of $819 million. Working capital grew $757 million due to higher customer account values stemming from higher prices and volume, coupled with the payment of our 2021 company-wide profit sharing of $360 million. We also funded $159 million in organic capital investments.\nWe believe full year 2022 capital investments will approximate $750 million the majority of which relate to our 4 new flat-rolled value-added coating lines to be located in Sinton and Heartland.\nWe also finalized the purchase of 45% of the equity interest in New Process Steel on February 1. We increased our first quarter cash dividend by 31% to $0.34 per common share based on the additional ongoing through-cycle free cash flow expected from our new Sinton steel mill.\nWe repurchased 390 -- excuse me, we repurchased $389 million of our common stock in the first quarter, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. As we exhausted our previous program, we also announced the Board's approval on an additional $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, further demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics future cash flow generation.\nSince 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143% and we've repurchased $2.7 billion of our common stock, representing 27% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizing strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nWe're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of that long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.\nFurther committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we've also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We had led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc core steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and our innovative solutions.\nWe plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our carbon reduction goals through among other avenues, investing in emission reduction projects, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technology. As an example, we're incredibly excited to recently invest $25 million in the equity of Aymium. Aymium is a producer of renewable biocarbon products that replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions in large global industries, including new electric arc furnace steel industry.\nWe have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than most of our peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving towards the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward.\nFor those of you that like to track our detailed flat roll shipments for the quarter, hot rolled and Pickled and Oiled shipments were 736,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments were 162,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,065,000 tons. Mark?\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations executed another exceptional record quarter. The earnings power of this platform in this environment still has not been completely displayed as customer demand and pricing continue to be strong.\nOur steel joist and deck order backlog remain at record volume and forward pricing levels, extending well into the first quarter of '23. The nonresidential construction market remains solid, considering the trend we have seen over the last year, especially in areas that support online retail, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities, along with data centers, schools and health care.\nOur steel fabrication operations provide a significant natural hedge to our steel production operations in a stable or moderating steel price environment. They also support our steel mills during periods of weaker steel demand as a ready internal customer, what we call pull-through volume, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel mills. We have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the U.S. and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad-based customer-centric supply chain.\nAs I move into metals recycling, I'll just take a moment to thank Russ Rinn given his impending retirement in July for the truly significant contributions he's made to that platform over his 10 years, 11-year tenure. He's helped transform that business. Today, we're operating at the same volumes with 1,500 less teammates. So the consolidation there and rationalization has been excellent. And I got massive faith in Miguel Alvarez, who now is leading that platform. I've got great faith that he's going to continue that transformation and do great things with that business. So Russ, my sincere thanks mate.\nOur metals recycling operations also performed well in the quarter with steady operating income of $48 million. As one of the largest ferrous and nonferrous metal recyclers in North America with operations throughout the U.S. and Mexico, we have a competitive advantage in providing the highest quality, cost-effective scrap to our EAF-based steel mills and to our other customers.\nIn today's environment, our advantage of having our metals recycling platform is even greater. During the last 18 months, our recycling and steel teams have worked closely in developing a higher-quality shredded scrap that can be used in place of prime scrap.\nThe combined effort resulted in our Butler Flat Roll Steel division, reducing its need for prime scrap from 65% of its mix to only 40%, while achieving the same steel qualities. We are currently rolling this out to our Columbus and Sinton Steel divisions, allowing for a lower cost, readily available, low-residual scrap supply. Additionally, given the historically high spread between prime and obsolete grades, which is around $170 a ton today, the reduced prime scrap requirement has provided a significant cost savings.\nThe teams are also working together as global pig iron supply chains have been disrupted with the advent of the invasion of Ukraine. Our flat-roll steel operations have reduced the demand of pig iron usage while maintaining the highest level of steel quality through changes in our operating practices and the health of our metals recycling team and sourcing alternative inputs. We have sufficient resources for our steel production to continue operating uninterrupted.\nAdditionally, of particular note, our Butler Flat Roll division has the advantage of iron dynamics, an on-site liquid pig iron production facility that supplies almost all of Butler's pig iron requirements. Charging liquid pig iron into the electric hot furnace also significantly increases productivity and reduces melting costs.\nWe developed the technology years ago and it's the only existing facility of its kind today. We are currently in the process of pursuing opportunities to become even more pig iron self-sufficient for the future. The steel team had an outstanding quarter as well, achieving record shipments and operating income of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at production utilization rate of 80%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93%.\nWe consistently operated at higher utilization due to our value-added product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and to support our internal manufacturing businesses. hot roll coil pricing moderated during the early part of the first quarter, but prices have recently firmed with extending order lead times across the product set, especially in coated products.\nWith continued strong demand, we believe steel prices will remain strong. Based on higher raw material input costs, global flat-rolled steel supply disruptions related to the Ukraine, Russia conflict and lower steel imports. Throughout our company history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and created valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility.\nToday, at least 70% of our steel sales are considered value-added. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain optimistic. The automotive sector steel consumption is expected to grow with production through 2024 returning to over 17 million units supported by an extreme lack of automotive dealer inventory and strong pent up demand.\nThe nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of our customer backlogs within our long product steel group. Our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions both achieved record quarterly earnings and our Engineered Bar Products division is operating at historically strong volumes.\nAnd additionally, as we discussed steel fabrication operations are operating at never seen before levels. Residential construction is also good, resulting in high demand for HVAC appliance and other related products. Strong energy prices continue to push up the rig count, and we have seen solid demand for energy products. In aggregate, our steel order backlogs and order input strength coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong throughout 2022. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous long-term value creation.\nOur most recent and significant investment represented by a new state-of-the-art electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill located in Sinton, Texas. This differentiated strategic investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for our teams and customers and for our vendors and shareholders. This electric arc furnace steel mill represents next-generation lower carbonate emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition.\nIt provides us with a more diverse value-added steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in our underserved steel consumer region that represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the U.S. and Mexico. We offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution for the region.\nWe will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast. We have 7 customers locating on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability, 4 are already operating, and the other 2 have broken ground -- 3 have broken ground actually. This represents a unique closed loop process as we provide them on-site steel and simultaneously reclaiming the scrap to be remelted into new steel products.\nWe have an advantaged raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. Our acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in 2020 provides a critical source of prime scrap supply. These operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico.\nSinton provides a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, with significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offers a lower carbon alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We currently expect 2022 shipments from Sinton to be over 1.5 million tons achieving utilization of approximately 80% by the end of the third quarter and over 90% before year-end.\nIn addition, our previously announced additional 4 value-added flat roll coating lines are still on schedule to begin operating mid-'23 in support of our Sinton steel mill and our Heartland flat roll operations. The 4 lines are comprised of 2 new paint lines and 2 new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. We're the largest domestic non-automated coater of flat roll steels with an annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. And these 4 lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons.\nIn closing, our sustainable symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability differentiating from any competition. We're not the same company that we were nearly 5 years ago. We are not just a steel company. Our average annual free cash flow has more than doubled and is still growing. The consistency and industrial strength of our earnings is clear and we are investing for transformational growth.\nOur people and their spirit of excellence provides the foundation for this success. And I thank you, each and every one of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So everyone, thank you for joining us today, and we'll open the line up for questions."

Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Happy 2022. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. We all appreciate your time, and thank you for joining us today.\nThe entire Steel Dynamics team delivered an exceptional performance in '21 with record sales, earnings and cash flow generation. The team totally shared the previous full year records. It was a tremendous achievement certainly supported by a strong market but driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to grow on through cycle and the capability. Thank you, team, for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. I'm proud to work alongside you.\nDue to the steadfast commitment, our people helped to one another and their families to our communities and to our customers, we are operating safely amidst the extended pandemic. The health and welfare of our teams remain paramount.\nRecord financial results are no important while teams did not remain safe. Although our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages, our safety performance deteriorated year-over-year. This is an unacceptable trend that we're working diligently to resolve as our intent will always to have 0 incidents.\nSince our founding over 25 years ago, we've been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. We are still an industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with [electric offer] technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our client footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nWe are starting from a position of strength. We have plans to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth.\nBut before I continue with additional market commentary, I'd like Theresa to share insights (inaudible).\n\nTheresa E. Wagler\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Company Secretary, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Good to be with you. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulate the entire team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record (inaudible) performance, with record revenues of $18.4 million derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms, record operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $3.2 billion or $15.56 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $4.6 [billion], truly an exceptional performance.\nRegarding our fourth quarter 2021 results, net income was $1.09 billion or $5.49 per diluted share, which includes additional performance-based company-wide special compensation of approximately $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share, which was awarded to all nonexecutive eligible team members in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Our fourth quarter contribution to the company share consolidation of $10 million or $0.04 per diluted share and costs of approximately $52 million or $0.18 per diluted share associated with the construction and startup of our (inaudible) Texas flat roll steel mill. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income was over $1.15 billion or $5.78 per diluted share.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 record revenues of $5.3 billion were 4% higher than the [partial] third quarter results driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and our flat roll steel operations.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 record operating income of $1.4 billion with 8% higher than sequential results driven by the continued demand trends in our steel fabrication operations.\nAs we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2022, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives.\nOur steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter as increased realized selling values expanded margins across the steel platform, offsetting seasonally lower volumes. Our lagging flat roll contract business represented approximately 80% to 85% of our total flat roll volume in the quarter.\nWe had quarterly steel (inaudible) of 2.7 million tons with our steel mill operating at 88% of our capability. For the full year 2021, our steel operations attributed numerous financial and operational milestones. The platform's full year operating income was a record $4.4 billion with record shipments of 11.2 million tons, truly phenomenal performance.\nNow to remind you, we still have additional market opportunity, mostly within our (inaudible) products group and in line with the startup (inaudible) in Texas as well. Because based on our existing annual steel shipping capability, we have [over] 13 million in tons of shipping capability on the steel side and (inaudible) fully ramped, it will be over [16] million tons.\nOperating income from our (inaudible) operations for the fourth quarter remained strong at $44 million based on the improved metal margins offsetting lower fair shipments. Many domestic steel mills have (inaudible) advantages throughout the fourth quarter, lowering various (inaudible). For the full year 2021, operating income for metals recycling operations was a record $195 million driven by uniquely higher volume and average selling value for both ferrous and nonferrous recycling shipment.\nThe team continues to effectively lever the strength of our (inaudible) manufacturing and operating model, thus being both our steel and eliciting operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves further efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements.\nOur steel fabrication operations also achieved record operating income in the quarter of $238 million, 2.5x record third quarter results, driven by materially higher realized selling value, which more than offset escalated average steel input costs. For the full year 2021, our steel fabrication platform achieved another record year with operating income of $365 million and record volumes of 789,000 tons, both (inaudible). Congratulations to the team. Steel (inaudible) and remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog in the quarter, extending throughout 2022. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase into 2022.\nOur cash generation continues to be strong on our differentiated secular business model and highly durable cost structure. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and are fully available and secure revolver of $1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $724 million and $2.2 billion for the full year, also a reference.\nWorking capital grew $1.7 billion during the year due to higher selling values resulting in increased customer account and inventory value. During 2021, we invested $1 billion in capital investments, of which $831 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill.\nDuring 2022, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $750 million, the majority of which relates to 4 new flat-rolled coating mines to be placed in (inaudible).\nRegarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of 2021. We also repurchased $330 million of our (inaudible) in the fourth quarter, representing 3% of (inaudible). At December 31, we had $383 million remaining on the price for repurchase under that program.\nIn the past 5 years, we've increased our cash dividend per share of about 86%, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock, representing 23% (inaudible) we achieved (inaudible) and maintained our growth company profile by investing $3.1 million (inaudible) capital investment funding (inaudible). These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation and the continued optimism and confidence in our future.\nOur capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation.\nWe are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of this strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest level of integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we also have interim milestones for 2025 and 2030.\nWe've led the steel industry with an exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and, we believe, considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play an industry leadership role moving forward.\nThank you, mark.\n\nMark D. Millett\n\nChairman, Co-Founder, CEO & President, Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n\nSuper. Thank you, Theresa. And as you said, our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2021, achieving record volume and earnings.\nThe earnings power of this platform in a strong construction environment is yet to be completely displayed. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was at a record level for both volume and forward pricing, extending through March of 2022.\nThe nonresidential construction market remains sound, especially in areas that support online retail, data centers, schools and health care, specifically represented by construction of distribution warehouse facility. Our steel fabrication operations provide a powerful natural hedge to our steel production operations in a steady or softening steel price environment.\nOur metals recycling operations also performed well this year, achieving record annual earnings and strong volume growth.\nThe acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August of 2020 has proven to be both strategic supply and an excellent investment, combining a great financial result with the additional benefit of growing access to prime scrap at North Central Mexico in support of our southern electric arc furnace at flat roll steel mill.\nThe metals recycling footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap-generating steel customers. We have ample access to ferrous scrap supply, including prime scrap, and believe this will remain the case in the future.\nThe steel team had an incredible year, achieving record volume and also record earnings of $4.4 billion, which eclipsed previous peaks. During 2021, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 81%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 91%. We consistently operate at a higher utilization due to our value-add steel diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.\nAs we suggested during our last earnings call, new capacity and moderate import growth is pressured to hot-rolled coil price. Supply side issues have largely been resolved, and lead times are back to manageable levels after ballooning post COVID as manufacturing steel demand recovered much more (inaudible) than expected by the industry. Hot-rolled coil pricing has moderated. But contrary to recent alarmist commentary, the magnitude of the price correction is in no way connected to any material in overall demand.\nInventory levels have certainly normalized the pre COVID levels but are more than appropriate for the present demand environment. December MSCI shipments dropped to approximately 2.4 million tons, but this is consistent with typical seasonality, not an abnormality. Monthly import levels have undergone controlled growth in recent months as the arbitrage expanded. But as anticipated, there's been no surge. The recent hot-rolled coil price declines should effectively eradicate import volume growth in the months ahead. These are natural market adjustments and are not structural changes.\nHot-rolled transactions are currently consistent with published index numbers in the range of $1,300 to $1,400 per ton. There are a limited number of large volume spot hot band offerings that can be procured at lower numbers, but these are not prevalent or reflective of the market in general. One must recognize that the spot comp and market has diminished in size over recent years as contract businesses increased across the industry. Therefore, it's not necessarily a true indicator of the whole market.\nCurrent hot-band spot offers are based on import values today, which are quickly drying up as the arbitrage strengths. Traders are reportedly finding it difficult to execute any business for second quarter delivery.\nThroughout our history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and create valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, over (inaudible) of our steel sales are considered value-add. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through-cycle cash generation.\nLooking forward, we remain steadfast in our optimism for 2022. After a short period of seasonally lower steel demand in November and December, our flat-rolled order input rate in January was one of the best months ever. And backlogs are very healthy. Automotive sector steel consumption should grow year-over-year as the chip shortage eases, fueled by an extreme lack of dealer inventory, which is [60%] lower than normal, and strong pent-up demand. The automotive sector operated at production rates lower than normalized levels in '20 and '21, around about 13 million units and is expected to grow to 15 million units this year and 17 million units in 2023.\nNonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural and rail division and steel fabrication businesses. Residential construction has also been reversed, resulting in high demand for HVAC material, appliance and other related products. Stronger energy prices are now pushing up the rig count and associated (inaudible) pipe production.\nIn aggregate, our steel backlogs and our order input strength, coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum, drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong through 2022. We anticipate steel demand increasing year-over-year and with a likely retraction of import volumes possibly a moderate rebound in pricing.\nSteel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. Our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill represents our most significant investment to date, providing the avenue for transformational growth and opportunity for ourselves and our customers. This differentiated investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for all of our stakeholders, from our teams and customers, to our vendors and shareholders. This EAF steel mill represents next-generation lower carbon emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions.\nThe 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon form competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate-conscious supply option.\nThe Sinton construction team has experienced numerous challenges related to supply chain disruptions and COVID impacts. These challenges resulted in hot-side production shifting from the end of 2021 to a class start before the end of February 22. The Sinton group navigated through the challenges as well, and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits this facility will generate. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in an underserved steel consumer region and represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the U.S. and Mexico. These customers are excited to have a freight advantage regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have 6 customers committed to locate on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability. Five of these customers have already broke ground.\nWe can offer shorter delivery times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution to the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting our customers in these areas with lower logistics costs, removing risks associated with ocean transit, quality and delivery. We have also made considerable progress in setting our raw material procurement strategy to the mill. As I mentioned, the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company is a critical source of prime scrap supply. They are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico and have already done a great job growing volume with a lot more to come.\nSinton is not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer a sustainable alternative to imports in a region in these developments.\nWe're also going to build 4 additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines comprised of 2 new paint lines and 2 new galvanized in lines with (inaudible) coating capability. Our unique value-added coated supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines.\nOne galvanizing line and one paint line will be located on site at Sinton, while the other 2 lines will be placed at our heartland flat roll division located in [Terra Oak], Indiana. Each site will increase flat-rolled capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them a more value-added product diversification to serve our customers. We expect these lines will begin operating mid-2023.\nIn closing, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Our sustainable, symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability differentiate us from any competition. We're excited to continue our growth with new value-creating opportunities. Our people and the spirit of excellence provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority.\nSo everyone, thank you for joining us today. And Kate, will you please open the line for questions?"

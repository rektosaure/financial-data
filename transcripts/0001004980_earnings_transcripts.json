My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the PG&E Corporation Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, we have allotted 45 minutes for this conference call.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jonathan, you may begin.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\nFirst, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation.\nThe presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. Our core earnings per share are [ $0.53 ] for the third quarter and $1.14 for the first 9 months of 2025. Today, we're narrowing our full year guidance range. We've previously shared a range of $1.48 to $1.52. The new range is $1.49 to $1.51 and we're keeping our bias toward the midpoint which is up 10% over 2024. We're also introducing our 2026 EPS guidance range of $1.62 to $1.66. At the midpoint, this is up 9% from our 2025 midpoint.\nLast month, on our investor update call, we extended our 5-year capital plan through 2030. Highlights included at least 9% EPS growth each year 2026 to 2030, a 5-year capital plan of $73 billion through 2030, which supports average annual rate base growth of 9% and a financing plan, which does not require new equity also through 2030.\nWith the 2025 California legislative session over and the enhanced protections of Senate Bill 254 in place, our team is focused on collaborating with key parties, advisers and state agencies as the Wildfire Fund administrator prepares their April 1 report and recommendations for how best to socialize and mitigate climate-driven wildfire risk in the state.\nThis report is expected to lay out a wide range of policy options that will inform potential legislative action to stabilize the utility sector in the 2026 session. We're feeling the positive momentum of this process with what Governor Newsom on issuing his recent executive order calls a whole of government response to protect Californians from Wildfire. We share the governor's sense of scale and urgency and are committed to supporting the state's efforts to meaningfully adapt California's policy construct to meet the moment.\nAs this work continues, we know that there's no better protection for our customers and our investors than predicting and preventing catastrophic fires in the first place. PG&E's physical layers of protection are delivering. Through October 20, our total year-to-date CPUC reportable ignitions are down over 35% from 2024 levels and are running lower than any year since we started tracking these data in 2015. Despite this year having seen the second largest number of fires greater than 10 acres statewide since 2017, PG&E is on track for a third consecutive year of 0 structures destroyed due to CPUC reportable fires in high-risk areas under high-risk conditions. We are proud of that.\nIn spite of continued elevated climate-related risk, PG&E's layers of protection from ignition prevention to hazard awareness and response are proving effective. Contributing to this performance, we can point to several ongoing and new mitigations. About a month ago, we marked a significant milestone for our customers. PG&E has now constructed and energized 1,000 miles of power lines underground in the highest fire-risk areas. As we've consistently said, undergrounding remains the most affordable and effective way of delivering the safety and resilience our customers deserve. Customers should not have to choose between safety and having reliable electricity. Undergrounding is the only mitigation that delivers both.\nThis year, we cleared vegetation in a 50-foot radius at the base of nearly 4,000 transmission structures our data showed this approach would have contained the majority of transmission-related ignitions that we have experienced over the last 3 years. And we're continuing to deploy advanced sensor capabilities. including installing another 8,500 sensor devices this year, which builds on the 10,000 we rolled out last year.\nThese low-cost sensors, coupled with our existing smart meters and our newly deployed AI-enabled machine learning model are enabling secondary system-wide continuous monitoring. This capability allows us to detect potential thoughts on the system before they occur, including on the customer side of the distribution pool. We will continue to leverage data to drive our mitigations in the field, making the system and our customers safer each and every day.\nIn addition to executing on this important safety work, my coworkers have been leveraging our performance playbook to deliver consistent outcomes across the business for customers and investors. You can see our simple affordable model is working. Our 5-year plan contemplates $73 billion of customer beneficial capital investment through 2030. At the same time, building on lowered electric rates this year and planned even lower rates for bundled electric customers in 2026, we expect customer bills in 2027 to be flat to down to where they are this year.\nWe are doing this by eliminating waste and delivering on our 2% O&M cost reduction goals, enabling rate reducing load growth by partnering with our large load customers and executing on a financial plan built with flexibility conservatism and credit metric targets supportive of investment-grade ratings, which will lead to interest expense savings for customers.\nWe know that performance is power. When we perform we will have the power to influence perceptions and outcomes. By putting customers at the heart of everything we do and by doing what we say, our brand trust is on the rise and has been since our 2027 GRC filing started to change the narrative on affordability. In fact, when compared to our U.S. utility peers, the second quarter 2025 residential customer engagement study by Escalent showed, we had the highest annual increase in brand trust.\nOur data center pipeline remains robust, at over 9.5 gigawatts. We've seen modest net attrition in our application and preliminary engineering phase since June. However, our projects in the final engineering stage continue to grow and advance. Most of the applications in our pipeline are for 100 megawatts or less. This is a function of existing California regulation but also assigned that data centers designed to support AI inference models have strong and compelling reasons to want to locate in PG&E service area, which includes Silicon Valley, the home of the technology sector.\nData centers of this size can be located in densely populated areas close to the end user and benefit from Northern California's extensive existing fiber network. This makes our service area a prime location for these customers who require real-time speed to ensure an optimal user experience. We are laser-focused on making this a win-win-win for our cities, our customers and data center developers. For example, we partnered with the City of San Jose to identify more than 150 acres of land adjacent to our existing infrastructure and in the heart of Silicon Valley that will be power ready for the data center selected from the city's competitive RFP issued earlier this year.\nOur robust pipeline with a diverse set of projects is a great opportunity for customer affordability and California's economic prosperity. Every gigawatt we bring online offers the opportunity to reduce electric bills by 1% to 2%. I'll remind you that this is upside to our plan, both in terms of customer affordability and in terms of capital growth. Given our bias for conservative planning, our capital plan only includes about $300 million a year for this type of capital, much of which falls under our FERC formula rate.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Carolyn to discuss our financials.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Here on Slide 8, we're showing you our earnings walk for the first 9 months of 2025. Core earnings per share are $1.14 and we're on track to deliver on our 2025 non-GAAP core EPS guidance narrowed today. As you can see, we've made additional progress towards our O&M cost savings goal contributing $0.05 for the quarter and $0.08 year-to-date. We continue to see unit cost reductions in our inspection processes and savings through vendor contract renegotiations as 2 examples of our cost savings initiatives.\nAnother key driver is timing and other. This bucket is contributing $0.10 for the quarter and $0.04 year-to-date. Both the third quarter and 9 months include benefits from smart tax planning. As a result of a method change, we're able to accelerate the deductibility of certain mark and recognize greater tax savings. We view this tailwind as upside available to redeploy for the benefit of our customers in addition to protecting future years.\nTurning to Slide 9. There's no change to the extended 5-year capital plan, which we shared with you last month. Our planned customer beneficial investments support average annual rate base growth of approximately 9%, 2026 through 2030. Our rate base growth in turn, supports annual core EPS growth of at least 9% also through 2030. As a reminder, our rate base forecast excludes the $2.9 billion of CapEx to be securitized under SB 254.\nIncrementally today, we're sharing more detail on our capital investment plan as shown here on Slide 10. This continues to be a no big bets plan. It includes many important projects over the course of the 5 years to improve safety, reliability and resiliency for our customers while enabling economic growth through capacity upgrades and new business connections.\nTo give you some examples, our plan includes a recently approved upgrade of our Helms hydro facility, enabling at least 150-megawatt increase in generating capacity. It also includes a substation upgrade, which more than doubles the electric capacity and improves reliability north of Sacramento. And it includes deployment of about 300,000 grid edge meters by 2030. These meters have distributed intelligent apps and advanced data processing, which support customer electrification as well as wildfire risk reduction.\nLast month, I shared with you our financing guidepost, shown here again on Slide 11. We Importantly, our plan is built not to require a new common equity through 2030, a key consideration given where we currently trade. I also emphasize that we are continuing to prioritize investment grade ratings including maintaining FFO to debt in the mid-teens. Again, IG is one of the most meaningful potential affordability enablers for our customers.\nI'll remind you that we're targeting a dividend payout ratio of 20% by 2028 and maintaining that level through 2030. This offers financing flexibility over the course of our plan as well as implying near-term compound EPS growth well in excess of 50% over the next 3 years. Our planning also contemplates the possibility that the Wildfire Fund administrator calls for the contingent contributions authorized by SB 254.\nRegarding capital allocation, I'll remind you what both Patti and I shared on our September update call. Based on progress in the 2025 legislative session and encourage and signals that the state is serious about pursuing further reform in Phase 2, we see the investment plan we have shared with you that's delivering for our customers and investors now and for the long run.\nThat being said, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach when it comes to capital allocation. If we were to reach a point where we aren't seeing clear indications of progress, we would certainly consider reallocating some capital towards more immediate shareholder return. Of course, always being mindful of our credit metrics. A key differentiator of the PG&E story is our performance playbook and focus on waste elimination to deliver better outcomes for our customers.\nTo that end, we've achieved nonfuel O&M savings in excess of our target for 3 years running, and I'm confident that we will meet or exceed our 2% reduction target again this year. We're also on track to make meaningful improvements in our capital to expense ratio this year and beyond. In 2024, we invested $0.90 of capital for every dollar of expense. We forecast that this year, we'll invest $1.20 of capital for every dollar of expense. On the regulatory and policy front, we expect a proposed decision on our cost of capital application in November. And as Patti said, important milestones are coming up as stakeholders weigh into the second phase of SP 254.\nI'll end here on Slide 14, with a reminder of our value proposition enabled by our differentiated performance. We're executing on our simple affordable model by generating annual cost savings for the benefit of our customers, enabling load growth with our 5-year capital investment plan and improving our balance sheet. I'm pleased Fitch has taken the first move to return our parent company rating to investment grade. This is just the beginning. As we continue to prove out our philosophy that performance is power.\nAnd now I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. The fundamentals of the PG&E playbook are undeniable. Strong layers of physical risk mitigation improving every day. ample runway to continue reducing nonfuel O&M, rate reducing load growth serving customers and California's prosperity, improving credit ratings and balance sheet health and our differentiated rate case proposal as a critical proof point all of which provide a path for customer bills to be flat to down in 2027 from today. These performance fundamentals set the stage for constructive legislation but more importantly, a framework that creates prosperity for customers and investors.\nWith that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

I am pleased to be with you this morning to share another solid quarter of execution. Our core earnings per share are $0.31 for the second quarter and $0.64 for [indiscernible]. full year guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a bias toward the midpoint, which is up 10% over 2024.\nTop of mind for us and likely for you, too, are matters before the California State Legislature, specifically, improving upon the AB 1054 Wildfire construct and landing sensible affordability legislation. I'll start with AB 1054.\nKey decision-makers are currently focused on ensuring there is a mechanism to protect the wildfire funds durability. I'm confident that meaningful measures will be enacted this session sufficient to address downside risk and improve upon the status quo. It's also becoming increasingly clear that the state, just as it has done before with earthquake risk, really needs a longer-term comprehensive societal approach to catastrophic wildfire risk in the context of our changing climate conditions. This will take longer than the next 6 weeks, but a constructive step forward this session will need to provide the necessary protections in the interim and give clear direction for substantive next steps.\nKeep in mind, as with AB 1054 the IOUs would need to opt in to any additional wildfire fund contributions. As such, any replenishment framework would need to be part of a package, which improves upon what we have today and also sets the stage for comprehensive reform.\nNext, regarding legislative proposals to address affordability, we are 100% aligned with our legislature on the goal of affordable service for our customers while not compromising on safety or reliability. Where we differ is on the most effective means to achieve our shared goal. There are some elements in the proposals, which we firmly support. For example, moving funding for public purpose programs off the utility bills. As we've seen in many prior sessions, initial language tends to evolve significantly by session end, resulting in better long-term outcomes for customers and investment in California. I'm confident that this can happen again in 2025. There is simply too much up stake for the state to not push forward to make the most constructive policy choices possible.\nAs evidenced by our 2027 general rate case proposal, our business fundamentals and core execution have never been stronger, and our simple affordable model is providing the framework to continue funding needed investment while holding customer bills at or below the rate of inflation.\nAs a reminder, the legislature is out on recess through August 18, after which they return for what is typically the busiest part of the session wrapping up on September 12.\nBased on what we see today and having modeled a range of potential outcomes, we're pleased to reaffirm our current 5-year financial plan through 2028. For EPS growth, 10% this year and at least 9% each year 2026 through 2028, $63 billion in capital investments, no change to our financing plan to fund this capital growth, including no further equity through 2028 and continuing to target reaching a 20% dividend payout by 2028. While we're not providing specific details beyond 2028 on this call, we remain confident that the simple affordable model can continue to drive sustainable savings for customers and earnings growth for investors for years to come. Once we have legislative clarity, we look forward to sharing more of the details with you and rolling forward our plans.\nAlso unchanged is our focus on physical and financial safety. Our prioritization of customer affordability and our firm commitment to enabling California's growth and clean energy ambitions.\nTurning here to Slide 5 are improving layers of physical protection ensure our hometowns are safer today and will be safer still tomorrow. We have a substantial suite of wildfire mitigations currently in place aimed at both ignition prevention and post ignition response, and we continue to learn and improve upon existing mitigations year-over-year.\nFor example, I'm particularly excited about our deployment of more than 10,000 sensors throughout our high-risk areas. These sensors attached to our poles with 4 screws can be installed in about 5 minutes and provide data with very tangible results for customers, including detecting potential failures before they occur, preventing ignitions and shortening outage durations. In addition, we've expanded our PSPS model to assess fuel risk beyond the traditional high-risk boundaries. And when conditions warrant, we won't hesitate to include such areas in a proactive power shutoff.\nWe've executed 4 PSPS events already in 2025, all of which included transmission lines. In fact, as part of our June PSPS event, a total of 22 transmission lines were de-energized for safety.\nGiven the potential impact of the Eaton fire on Wildfire Fund durability, some of you have asked what happens if there's another big fire this year before new legislation goes into effect? As a reminder, for any fire in 2025, we would first turn to our customer-funded self-insurance, which addresses claims up to $1 billion. We're also able to request cost recovery from the FERC under our formula rate. Beyond the $1 billion threshold, we would turn to the Wildfire Fund. And beyond the funds, we would seek recovery from the CPUC under the enhanced prudency standard. Importantly, PG&E has an annual safety certificate in place today. And clarifying one common misconception, if there are multiple events within a single coverage year, which together exceeds the fund's resources, then available funds would be paid out by the administrator pro rata and not on a first event first paid basis.\nMoving to Slide 6. I want to reiterate that we share our state's desire to address customer affordability. In fact, we've been at it for a number of years, and we are on our way to delivering on that key priority. Our bills went down this year, and our forecast show residential combined bills to be essentially flat for the remainder of 2025, and going down again in 2026. We also see a pathway for 2027 bills to be lower than they are today. Our rate case, as proposed, would result in customer bills being flat compared to current bills as GRC revenue increases are offset by reductions in other items. This is a darn good proposal. And yet we're taking additional actions to lower rates even further.\nFor example, our flat projection does not include savings from the DOE loan facility, reduced borrowing costs when we achieve investment grade, and beneficial load growth, allowing us to spread our fixed costs over more units of energy. We forecast the energy we provide will continue to be more and more affordable through the deployment of the simple affordable model. Over time, our customers will experience savings and notice the trend.\nAlso, with electric bills expected to be on the rise nationally, affordability can become a positive differentiator for us and we're looking forward to turning around the prevailing narrative with California regulators and policymakers.\nAnother driver of affordability will be beneficial load growth. As you see here on Slide 7, our data center pipeline continues to grow. Last quarter, our pipeline reflected demand of 8.7 gigawatts. Now adding interest from our second cluster study offset by some attrition, we're actively working 10 gigawatts through various stages. That's healthy growth since last quarter and a nearly 3x increase since this time last year. The 10 gigawatts represent more than 50 different projects, many on the smaller side, consistent with the inference market. We recently filed for approval to serve Microsoft's planned 90-megawatt data center project in San Jose. This is just one of many smaller projects in our pipeline.\nI'd like to call our data center growth Goldilock load, not so much to be a problem and yet enough to be beneficial for all of our customers. This is because our demand is differentiated by having a diverse set of projects, ensuring that our development pipeline remains robust and not reliant on a single location, counterparty or approved. While we value this diversification, we're also excited to be seeing data center operators expressed interest in some larger-sized projects as well as locating beyond the Bay Area into other prime locations within our service area. The market has gotten the message. PG&E is ready to serve. This is good news for Californians who stand to benefit from this unprecedented growth.\nOur civic leaders recognize this opportunity too. Just last week, I had the pleasure of standing with San Jose Mayor, Matt Mahan, to formally announce nearly 2 gigawatts of projects in the city of San Jose, powered by PG&E. Our 10 gigawatt pipeline enables California to create thousands of new construction and permanent jobs in the state, secure the future of AI and tech in California for decades to come. And generate billions of dollars in annual revenue for the state through increased property taxes and additional sales tax revenue. We're particularly excited by beneficial loads because every gigawatt we bring online offers the opportunity to reduce electric bills by 1% to 2%.\nThe fundamentals of the PG&E operational story are strong and getting stronger. The proof is in our results, improving and building upon our physical layers of protection year-over-year, submitting a general rate case, which delivers on our commitment to stabilize customer rates, and seizing the tremendous opportunity for customer affordability from data center load growth in our service area.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Here on Slide 8, we're showing your earnings walk for the first 6 months of 2025. Although core earnings of $0.64 are down from this point last year, as Patti mentioned, we're on track with our internal plan and confident in delivering on our 2025 noncore EPS guidance of $1.48 to $1.52 with a bias to the midpoint.\nFirst half results were impacted by the dilution from our December equity financing, in addition to the CPUC cost of capital Phase 2 decision last October. Over the second half, timing items are expected to fully reverse and we have line of sight of additional O&M savings. We have nearly 100 different initiatives, big and small, that are yielding savings and will continue to yield more savings this year.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our 2027 general rate case is the lowest GRC percentage increase we've requested in 10 years and reflects our commitment to stabilize customer bills by deploying our simple, affordable model. With only a modest increase in base GRC revenues and an expected reduction in other items, we see a path for residential bills to be down in 2027 compared to today. This is the result of an intentional continuous effort to eliminate waste on behalf of our customers. In fact, in this filing, we highlight $2.5 billion in capital and expense saved across the enterprise from 2022 to 2024. These savings are being delivered across PG&E. We've rebalanced our use of subcontractors in gas operations. In electric operations, we've deployed tools to enhance our work bundling strategy and improved our new service application process to accelerate connections.\nAnd as we've talked about before, we continue to find opportunities to reduce the cost per mile of undergrounding, including piloting new installation equipment.\nOur simple affordable model is enabled in part by annual nonfuel O&M cost reductions. Annual savings exceeded $200 million in 2022, 2023 and 2024. And I'm increasingly confident we are on track to continue beating our 2% target this year and beyond.\nWith continued strong execution in this area, coupled with efficient financing and beneficial load growth, we see a path to holding bill growth to 1% to 3% while continuing to make needed capital investments on behalf of our customers.\nHere on Slide 11, we're reaffirming our $63 billion capital plan through 2028. Not included in the plan is an incremental at least $5 billion of customer beneficial work, much of which is FERC transmission. As we think about this $5 billion, I should emphasize, we will be very mindful of our valuation discount to utility peers, and I can assure you that we have no intention of issuing additional equity at these levels. As you know, we have already issued the equity needed to fund our existing $63 billion investment plan through 2028, and we have achieved compliance with our authorized regulated capital structure. This gives us considerable flexibility moving forward.\nWhen it comes to capital allocation, I want you to know, first, we plan conservatively. Second, we have a number of options and have built a plan with several points of flexibility. Third, we think and plan long term with our customers in the state's best interest at heart. Fourth, we will always be mindful of market conditions as they relate to funding the plan. Finally, to be clear, if the state did implement policy choices, which significantly constrain our longer-term ability to deploy a needed growth capital accretively, we would carefully consider whether it might be more efficient to return some capital to shareholders.\nFocusing on proposals to securitize some of our capital investment, we strongly believe that this is not the right policy choice for our customers. Not only is it ineffective at delivering meaningful near-term customer savings, it also risks increasing our actual cost of capital, thereby driving up customer costs on the balance of our rate base, a significant unintended consequence. That said, we strongly support the goal of passing affordability legislation in this session, and we're advocating in the legislature for policy choices that more effectively deliver on our shared goal of affordability.\nAs Patti mentioned earlier, we've modeled a range of potential legislative outcomes for our current 5-year plan, and we remain confident that we have sufficient financial flexibility built in to deliver on our earnings guidance.\nOur 5-year financing plan shown here on Slide 12 remains unchanged. The plan is built to support our customer beneficial capital investments while also sustaining investment-grade credit metrics. As we've said in the past, the $2 billion parent debt paydown by 2026 in our plan was not an obligation. We're reevaluating this element of our plan, and we'll likely maintain the current level of parent debt through 2026. This decision gives us flexibility in our 2026 plans, and we're still forecasting mid-teens FFO to debt.\nSecond, we have created flexibility to defer some long-term financing to 2026, depending on conditions later this year. We're continuing to indicate $5 billion of estimated utility long-term debt issuance in 2025. We've raised $3 billion of this so far. And following the extension of our revolving credit facility that closed in June, we have flexibility to manage the remaining 2025 maturities without returning to the market until 2026.\nReaching investment grade at the parent company will be a big win for our customers and continues to be a key focus for us with the resulting lower future borrowing costs, investment grade is one of the most impactful and fast-acting affordability enablers, a point we will continue to emphasize in the context of the ongoing policy discussions. Last quarter, I mentioned that this was a big year for us in terms of regulatory filings. Two of those filings are behind us and moving through the process. First, the cost of capital application, which will set our CPUC return on equity for 2026. We believe we've made a strong case and look forward to a final decision before the end of this year. As a reminder, our filing is premised on the state delivering a constructive legislative fix for wildfire liability policy this year. Second, the 2027 GRC proposal, which I've already addressed. And third, our 10-year undergrounding plan, which we intend to file by year-end.\nI'll end here on Slide 15 with a reminder of our value proposition, which we reaffirmed again today. We're focused on execution, including on the policy front, serving our customers and also delivering for our investors. I firmly believe that these commitments are not mutually exclusive. Today, we're standing for stabilizing customer builds and delivering consistent, predictable outcomes for all.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. While I acknowledge the questions prompted by the current legislative session, the fundamentals of the PG&E playbook are undeniable. Strong layers of physical risk mitigation improving every day, ample runway to continue reducing nonfuel O&M, beneficial load growth serving customers in California's prosperity, improving credit ratings and balance sheet health, our differentiated rate case proposal all providing a path for customer bills to be flat to down in 2027 from today.\nAs I like to say, performance is power. It's our responsibility to continue to demonstrate performance and earn the trust and cooperation of our legislative leaders so that we can follow through on our promise to perform. When we do what we say and continue to improve our performance, we have the power to influence perceptions and outcomes. I've never felt more certain about the PG&E team and our ability to deliver both for our customers and our investors. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

    "content": "Q1 2025 PG&E Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2025 PG&E Corp Earnings Call\n\nPCGNYSEAPR 24, 11:00 AM\n\nThis is a machine generated transcript.\n\nDon't show again\n\nFox, to 8.7 gigawatts. We are privileged to serve California, including the Bay Area, which has the fiber network enabling speed and reliability for data center customers, and also the density of talent needed to maximize the potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nWe have 1.4 gigawatts in final engineering, comprised of 18 projects.\n\nTo date, these have not been the mega data center projects designed to power large language learning models rather the demand in our service area has been mostly from customers looking to power inference models which are driving value for their businesses.\n\nTrue Goldilocks demand. Big enough to matter, not so big that it's a problem.\n\nWith differentiates this opportunity in California is a diversified set of customers and projects, access generation to power incremental load in the near term, and a regulatory approach which ensures that our existing residential customers will save money.\n\nWe continue to estimate that for every gigawatt of new electric demand from data centers, customers may save between one to two percent on their electricity bill. This is just some of the exciting work my team has been doing here at PG&E when we've got more to come.\n\nWe know that to best capture this customer-benefitting load growth, we will need to attract high-quality, long-term, low-cost capital. We trust our policy makers to understand this, and we want you to trust California policy makers, too.\n\nOur team continues to work closely with key decision makers on wildfire policy improvements. At a high level we're looking to build on the already strong existing state legislative framework, rebuild investor confidence and ultimately make the model even stronger.\n\nIn our advocacy, we're making sure state leaders understand that addressing capital provider and rating agency concerns is critical to ensuring access to competitively priced long-term capital addressing these concerns is also critical to delivering the most affordable solutions for our customers.\n\nAs the legislative process continues, let me remind you of our existing physical layers of protection in place and shown here on Fly Day.\n\nWe're building infrastructure for purpose, a system that is safer and more resilient every day. In early March, we filed our 2026-2028 wildfire mitigation plan.\n\nWith this proposed plan, we will continue working to reduce wildfire risk attributable to vegetation or other objects contacting our power lines through both system resilience programs and operational programs which reduce risk during periods of severe weather.\n\nThere's nothing more important than ensuring public and co-worker safety. Rebuilding PG&E's safety culture was one of the most important challenges when I joined the company in 2021.\n\nBack then, we were experiencing a coworker or contractor fatality on the job every 90 to 100 days.\n\nThat was truly shocking and a call for action.\n\nI'm very proud to share that today we are at 814 days without a fatality and that is the longest run in over 25 years and we are still going.\n\nThe practical fact is that I can't be on every job site ensuring our safety procedures are being followed. Rather, every day my co-workers are showing up choosing to be safe, choosing to keep each other safe above all else.\n\nThis is one of the most important proof points of the culture change that is happening at PG&E.\n\nOur system is safer, our home towns are safer, and my co-workers are living our safety values every day on the job. That's the culture of safety you can believe in. However, we will never be satisfied when it comes to safety and we continue to work it every day.\n\nAs you know, the safest job site is also the most productive one, and safety performance is a critical leading indicator for consistent financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carolyn.\n\nThank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to cover three main topics with you.\n\nFirst, our quarter-over-quarter results. Second, a reiteration of our sector-leading five-year capital plan and our D-risk financing plan. And third, our continued execution against the simple, affordable model.\n\nStarting here on Slide 9, we're showing you our first quarter 2025 earning swap. Our core earnings of 33 cents are down 4 cents over 2024.\n\nRecall last year, in the first quarter, we had some unexpected tailwind, most notably the increase in ROE from 10 to 10.7%. We were committed to redeploying that upside to the benefit of both our customers and investors, and we did.\n\nMost of our read deployment came through in 2024 in later quarters, as we pulled work forward to de-risk 2025. Without a similar tailwind this year, we are instead observing a lower ROE and dilution from our well-time December equity issuance.\n\nWith line of sight on savings over the balance of the year, we fully expect to deliver our 2025 plan even while we look for opportunities to de-risk next year. This is what we mean when we say we ride the roller coaster so you don't have to.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the main positive driver was higher customer capital investment.\n\nThis contributed two cents, and that's net of the reduction in the authorized return on equity related to the phase two cost the capital decision, that's 10.28% this year compared to the 10.7% in effect for 2024.\n\nThese items are offset by redeploying two cents to various programs, including those supporting risk mitigation, two cents from equity dilution and three cents of timing and other.\n\nTurning to 510, there is no change to our 5-year $53 billion capital plan through 2028.\n\nThere's no shortage of customer beneficial work on our transmission and distribution systems and we still see an incremental at least $5 billion of investment needs.\n\nand what's more, our growth is reversed, with no single project accounting for more than 2% of the overall plan.\n\nWhen it comes to incremental demand, it's important to remember we have a number of options or combinations thereof. We could add to our already robust plan.\n\nWe could prioritize investment tied to connecting new load, what we're calling beneficial load growth, and or we could extend the duration of our sector leading rate-based growth story.\n\nIn other words, we have opportunities to make our plan bigger during more for customers, make it better in terms of affordability and longer in duration.\n\nTurning to 5-11, we were very pleased to see the upgrade from Moody to March, which brought the utility issuer at credit rating to investment grade. We have more work to do at each of the agencies to get the parent company to investment grade, and that continues to be our focus.\n\nOur five-year financing plan remains unchanged, as shown here on slide 12. This is a strong plan built to a support, achieving investment in grade ratings and prioritizing customer capital investment.\n\nWhile our debt needs have not changed over the five year period, we are modestly reducing our 2025 long term debt guidance by a half billion dollars. As some of that has now shifted to 2026, due to a term loan extension we closed on earlier this month.\n\nOn the equity side, our December issuance put us back in compliance with our authorized regulatory capital structure ahead of schedule and prior to our cost of capital filing.\n\nWe also benefit from our differentiated dividend payout. We believe 20% by 2028 remains an appropriate target, allowing us to retain a significant majority of our earnings and prioritize needed customer capital investment on our system.\n\nAubrey Mindjou, our five-year plan does not assume any savings from the DOE loan or achieving investment grade, even though these are both near-term priorities.\n\nAs Patty mentioned, both would be affordability benefits for our customers versus the base plan.\n\nTurning to slide 13, executing against our simple affordable model is how we're making our industry leading capital growth affordable for our customers.\n\nWe worked each element each and every day.\n\nOwen M. Savings, where I'm particularly proud of our track record exceeding our annual 2% target.\n\nBeneficial Low Growth, where the opportunity continues to grow, and efficient financing opportunities, which we aggressively pursue.\n\nRegarding our ONM cost reductions, we saved over $500 million in 2023 and another nearly 350 million in 2024. And as Patty noted, we're excited to incorporate these savings into our GRC filing.\n\nOur ability to achieve these savings after observing inflation is the capability that is becoming more beneficial for our customers in the current uncertain economic environment.\n\nOur sourcing is primarily from domestic suppliers. Deploying our performance playbook, we intend to offset tariff-related cost pressures and inflation.\n\nAs you've come to expect from us, our goal is to manage through these ups and downs of the business, and this will continue to be our default and first line of defense.\n\nThat said, we also operate under a constructive California regulatory model, which has mechanisms specifically designed to address significant unanticipated items on a timely basis, including outside the rate case cycle.\n\nWith respect to recession risk, our decoupled revenue model offers significant protection and our investment plans aren't built around any particular large project.\n\nNetNet, California's regulatory construct combined with our lean operating system is a powerful buffer against economic headwind.\n\nDuring the first quarter, the CPUC approved our settlement agreement to establish a non-while-fired self-insurance program. Assuming no claims, customers have the potential to save more than $600 million through 2030 under this program.\n\nThis is another example of how we're working creative and innovative solutions on behalf of customers.\n\nWe continue to see abundant opportunities to reduce costs in 2025 and beyond. Just take our capital to expense for future as one proof point.\n\nWhile we've improved our ratio, we're still spending only 90 cents capital for every dollar of expense.\n\nBest in class is spending $2.40. This remains a huge opportunity for us as we continue to drive L&M savings and invest in the most affordable infrastructure for our customers.\n\nTurning to slide 14. As I've said before, 2025 is a big year in terms of regulatory filing.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we submitted our 2026 cost of capital application supporting an ROE of 11.3 percent.\n\nWe expect a final decision by year end with the new authorized cost of capital going into effect January 1st, 2026.\n\nAnother constructive feature of California's regulatory model is the fact that our cost of capital is decided independently of our general rate case.\n\nAnd as you know, we'll make the GRC proposal on May 15th, covering the period 2027 through 2030.\n\nLike Patty, I am very excited to prove out the simple affordable model for the benefit of our customers.\n\nWe also plan to file our 10-year underground and proposal with our safety regulator before the end of the year.\n\nI strongly believe that performance is power and power.\n\nWe've been delivering on our sector leading capital growth plan, converting rate-based growth into earnings growth proving that what's good for customers is also good for investors. We continue to plan conservatively and deliver consistent, predictable results. We do what we say.\n\nAnd on that note, let me end here on slide 15 with a reminder of our value proposition, consistent, predictable performance, serving our customers and delivering for investors.\n\n10% rate-based growth through 2028, 10% core EPS growth in 2025.\n\nAt least 9% core EPS growth each year from 2026 through 2028, and bill increases held between two to four percent.\n\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Patty.\n\nThank you, Carolyn. Our simple, affordable model is how we're executing on an industry leading capital growth plan serving California while stabilizing customer bills.\n\nOur proven wildfire risk mitigation performance that gets stronger still every day and our culture of safety being lived day in and day out is what gives me confidence that the culture we're creating here at PG&E is sustainable.\n\nWe're excited about all the catalysts in front of us, resolving the AB-1054 uncertainty.\n\nRealizing the promise of our simple affordable model through our upcoming GRC, reaching investment grade at the holding company, delivering on our growing large load story.\n\nDrawing down on our DOE Lone Facility, extending our track record of ONM Savings and filing our 10-year undergrounding plan.\n\nI've never felt more confident in the PG&E team and our ability to deliver for our customers and our investors.\n\nWith that operator, please open the line for questions.\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press card one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue.\n\nIf you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone in your device, please pick up your handset to ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question.\n\nWe do request for today's session, but you please limit to one question and one follow-up question.\n\nWe have allotted 30 minutes for Q and A. Again, press star 1 to join the queue."

    "content": "Q4 2024 PG&E Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2024 PG&E Corp Earnings Call\n\nPCGNYSEFEB 13, 11:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PG&E Corporation Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Release. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI will now hand today's call over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\nFirst, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation.\nThe presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nWith that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I know last month's heartbreaking fires in Southern California are on your mind, and we will address your concerns about them today. But first, please allow me to cover our fourth quarter and full year results.\nAs we like to say, performance is power. And in 2024 was another year of powerful performance at PG&E. On Slide 3 are some of our 2024 highlights. Our core earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.31, bringing us to $1.36 for the year, and 11% growth over 2023. We've updated our 2025 guidance range with the midpoint up 10% from our actual 2024 results. This bumps our 2025 range by $0.01, to $1.48 to $1.52. There's no change to our EPS growth guidance for 2026 through 2028, which remains at least 9% each year. As you saw from us in both 2023 and 2024, future year growth will continue to be based off our actual results. With our December issuance the equity need to fund our $63 billion capital investment plan through 2028 is fully behind us.\nIn December, we also provided you with clarity on our dividend plans. Our annual dividend rate for 2025 is $0.10, up from $0.04 in 2024. We also shared our intent to reach a dividend payout ratio of 20% of our core earnings per share by 2028 with consistent annual increases. Clearly, this implies a growth rate well in excess of our earnings.\nWe continue to build our cost reduction muscle, saving 4% in nonfuel O&M costs in 2024 on top of savings achieved in 2022 and 2023. And we're delivering on our affordability commitments. In fact, assuming similar usage, combined residential gas and electric bills remain flat for January 2025 compared to January 2024.\nMoving to Slide 4. This should start to look familiar to you. 2024 is now our fourth consecutive year of delivering predictable premium results for you, our investors, while we are also delivering more for our customers through our simple affordable model. As you've seen, we've achieved our -- or beaten our earnings guidance each year, and we're building a track record of consistently rebasing future years of our actual results.\nThe key to our delivery is the PG&E performance playbook coupled with conservative planning. Of course, there will always be ups and downs within a given year. Storms, regulatory outcomes, economic factors, our core capability is to weather these ups and downs, delivering consistent, predictable premium results year in and year out. As Carolyn will discuss in a minute, in 2024, we were able to redeploy $0.16 for the benefit of our customers and deliver 11% earnings growth for our investors.\nEven though the recent devastating fires have been outside our service area and our equipment was not involved, they reinforce the importance of our stand that catastrophic wildfires shall stop. Based on the physical protections we have in place today, our system has never been safer, and we are working to make it even safer as we continue to implement our wildfire mitigation plan and learn from every ignition.\nTurning to Slide 6. In addition to physical safety, we understand that you need to feel safe committing your clients' money to California. We know that they, PG&E shareholders and bondholders are often Californians, including pension holders, teachers, firefighters and police. We want them to feel that their money is safe when invested in a California utility.\nWhile the utilities have made significant strides in risk mitigation, it seems clear that timely reforms are needed to extend the AB 1054 framework given evolving views of a worst-case fire. We here loud and clear the market's concerned about risk exposure beyond the $21 billion wildfire fund as well as implications for the utility liability cap under the current statute. You can be assured that building and improving upon the core AB 1054 protections already in place is a critical priority for our team.\nAt the same time, it's important to acknowledge that California's policymakers have established an industry-leading model to meet the needs of investors and victims of catastrophic wildfires. In 2019, the legislature passed Assembly Bill 1054, which built upon 2018 Senate Bill 901. And the state continues to prove its resilience and ability to adapt. As CPUC President, [ Alex Reynolds ] said, and reference to the Southern California fires at a recent commission meeting, and I quote, \"I expect the state to move forward on further solutions as these ever dynamic challenges continue\".\nOur model today was created first and foremost, to provide important protections for the victims of catastrophic wildfires. The state Wildfire Fund assures compensation for victims of utility cause fires while helping to ensure that utilities can continue to raise capital efficiently and affordably, enabling needed investment in safety and climate resiliency.\nFor those newer to the story, are looking for a refresher, the AB 1054 framework is based around an enhanced prudency standard, which supports the recovery of socialized wildfire losses incurred by utilities under California's no-fault inverse condemnation strict liability construct. AB 1054 also provides a cap on utility reimbursements back to the wildfire fund in the unusual event that the utility is found to have been imprudent.\nA key statutory requirement for issuance of an annual safety certificate is having an approved wildfire mitigation plan. These WMPs are subject to approval by the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, our dedicated safety regulator. They're extremely comprehensive and subject to an intense and very public regulatory process. Getting one approved is no small undertaking, and rightly so, since they provide utilities with clarity on what's required of them to establish prudency upfront and also a yardstick to measure prudency if later challenged.\nThis is a 180-degree change from the pre-AB 1054 world, where the [indiscernible] was fully on the utility to establish prudency after the fact. Importantly, California's prudent manager standard is not a perfection standard. The model gives the utilities clear alignment with the safety regulator to continually improve upon mitigation strategies. Exactly what the industry-leading meteorology and operations teams that PG&E strive to do each and every day. This model provides clarity around what constitutes prudent operations and a clearly defined framework for quantifying the consequences of failing to perform as required.\nYou can see the proof points. Working as intended is the multiyear wildfire mitigation plan process. The issuance of annual safety certificates and our monthly Dixie liquidity draws from the wildfire fund facilitated through the California Earthquake Authority. In fact, our latest safety certificate was issued in December and came ahead of schedule. No other state has such a structure in place today and California's approach has allowed our utilities to become industry leaders in wildfire mitigation.\nAt the same time, I appreciate that the financial community is asking important and urgent questions about the resiliency of the California model in light of recent events in Southern California. I know that our state leaders are hearing your concerns, and we'll keep advocating that key [ tenets ] of AB 1054 be upheld and enhanced. Ultimately, our construct is designed to serve the people of California in the event of loss, and it is this which gives me confidence that we will make the necessary timely improvements to ensure that our utilities remain in a strong position to efficiently finance continued investment in safety, growth and other key state priorities.\nCalifornia policymakers have a track record of taking constructive actions, especially when Californians benefit. As evidenced through [ SB 901 ] in 2018, AB 1054 in 2019, builds to extend operations at [ Diablo Canyon ] in support for undergrounding in 2022, and [ SB 410 ] supporting accelerated cost recovery for energization in 2023. These actions acknowledge the legislature's understanding of the instrumental role that California's investor-owned utilities play in enabling our state's growth and prosperity.\nMeanwhile, we are building trust in our communities by continuing to operate the electrical systems safely and develop the necessary infrastructure to meet changing climate conditions. As shown here on Slide 7, our foundations of physical [ safety ] starts by understanding the risk each and every day. This situational awareness is propelled by data and experience. It informs our wildfire mitigation plans and our layers of protection, which importantly cover both our local distribution grid as well as our high-voltage transmission system.\nI used to call Public Safety Power Shutoffs or PSPS, [ a ] mitigation of last resort. In fact, PSPS is our first layer of protection when weather and fuel conditions demand a proactive de-energization of our power system to keep customers safe. In 2024, PG&E called 6 PSPS events, all of them executed without safety incidents and 4 of which included some of our transmission system. Thanks to our efforts to [indiscernible] the system, only approximately 50,000 customers were impacted over the course of these events.\nWe also just completed our third full year of EPSS deployment. This advanced technology is now in place on 100% of our distribution circuits in high-fire threat districts and in select adjacent areas. As I said, it's upon this foundation of safety, that we move forward. Ultimately, we are here to serve the residents of Northern and Central California, providing safe and reliable power to our customers, both big and small.\nAs you know, it's not just a bread-and-butter new energization request we're seeing. Like others, we're also seeing increasing demand to power data centers and perhaps surprisingly, other large loads like warehouses, electric fleet depots and manufacturing growth in our service area, including in and around Silicon Valley.\nLast June in New York City, we discussed beneficial load and said that we expected to provide an update on this call. Today, we're sharing our progress. This leads me to my story of the month here on Slide 9.\nMany of you have asked how much of this demand is real. As of now, we have formal applications representing 5.5 gigawatts of new potential data center load moving through our pipeline. This is just the data center load. As I've said before, there's no one silver shovel. Ours is a no big [ bets ] load growth story. It's a thoughtful, deliberate process of pursuing mode growth, what I call the Goldilocks approach, not so little that it doesn't matter and not so much that it results in cautious to residential customers. And we see a clear path to lowering customer bills as a result of adding what we call beneficial loads.\nWe're getting more calls every day as customers learn California and PG&E specifically are open for business. We, too, are learning a lot from this process. As of last week of the 5.5 gigawatts in our pipeline, 1.4 gigawatts has passed through the preliminary engineering study phase, meaning these potential customers now have preliminary cost estimates and proposed time to power, and have agreed to advance to the next phase. These 1.4 gigawatts come from 15 customers, including hyperscalers and developers, and represent 27 unique sites. This beneficial load is projected to come online as early as 2026. And we forecast that over 90% will be online before the end of 2030, driven by customer requested time to power and PG&E's responsiveness.\nIn order to more efficiently and uniformly address these electric service requests and improve our ability to meet customers requested in service dates, last November, we proactively filed an application with the CPUC for approval of Electric Rule 30. Importantly, in this filing, we have proposed upfront funding from large load customers, something which they also support in the name of accelerating our ability to serve them. The premise is that the large customer takes the risk if their forecast load does not materialize over an initial 10-year period protecting our existing customers from having funded a stranded asset.\nWe estimate that for every 1,000 megawatts of new electric demand from data centers, customers may save between 1% to 2% of their electricity bill, creating the headroom to make our grid safer and more resilient at a lower cost. This turns my story of the month into our story of the next decade of growth. We are excited to be partnering with these customers, serving the innovation capital of the world and doing so in a way that positively impacts the people of California. This is a simple, affordable model taking up speed.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I am pleased to cover 3 main topics with you. First, our full year 2024 results. Second, a reiteration of our 5-year capital and financing plans. And third, how we continue to build upon our foundation of financial safety and execute against our simple, affordable model.\nStarting here on Slide 10. We're showing you our 2024 earnings [ walk ]. Our core earnings of $1.36 are up 11%, or $0.13 over 2023. The main driver was higher customer capital investments, which contributed $0.26. This includes the benefit of the higher 2024 ROE of 10.7%, which we previously told you we would redeploy, and we did. Nonfuel O&M savings contributed $0.07 to our results and included savings achieved for various programs such as improving our inspections as well as lower contract spend enabled by strategic sourcing.\nWe are all about the [ ends ] here at PG&E, and you can see that with our 2024 results. We've been very clear about our commitment to share any upside with customers and investors. Our [ redeployment ] for the full year was $0.16 and went towards programs that support risk mitigation, such as inspections, gas line corrosion mitigation and distribution maintenance. Redeployment also results in derisk in future years, helping us deliver consistent and predictable results for customers and investors.\nTurning to Slide 11. There is no change to our 5-year $63 billion capital plan through 2028, and we still see an incremental at least $5 billion of additional customer investment needs. As we've discussed before, there is no shortage of customer beneficial work on our transmission and distribution systems.\nThe second phase of our SB 410 application is still pending. And as Patti discussed, large low demand applications are growing. Here's how we're thinking about this incremental demand.\nFirst, we could simply add to the $63 billion plan. Second, we could high-grade or prioritize investment tied to new load, which can also improve customer affordability. And third, we could extend the duration of our sector-leading rate base growth story.\nAs we get approval for incremental capital, including in 2025 and 2026 through our pending SB 410 filing, you can expect us to revisit the work plan and to carefully weigh up the merits of these 3 distinct options, or a combination thereof. All 3 of them offer pathways to make an already strong plan even stronger.\nWe have also not changed our 5-year financing plan as shown here on Slide 12. I am pleased to remind you that in November and early December, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to complete a $2.75 billion equity offering, as well as equity content junior subordinated notes. These combined completed the $3 billion equity funding shown here. With our equity needs through 2028 derisked, we can focus on providing affordable and resilient power to Northern and Central California.\nOur financing plan was built to support achieving investment-grade ratings and prioritizing customer capital investment. Our brand of thoughtful conservatism is also built into this plan. We maintain flexibility both with our low dividend and our commitment, [ not ] obligation to pay down $2 billion of parent debt.\nIn terms of financial safety, we've been laser-focused on building a healthy balance sheet and reaching investment grade. Our December equity issuance put us back in compliance with our authorized regulatory capital structure ahead of schedule. We also benefit from our differentiated dividend payout. We believe [ 20% ] by 2028 is an appropriate sustainable level for us, given our near-term balance sheet priorities and need for customer capital investment on our system.\nOur robust capital plan contributes to cash from operations, which, in turn, drives balance sheet health and investment-grade supportive credit metrics. As you can see here on Slide 13, we more than doubled operating cash flow from 2022. The GRC has been a key driver of this improvement as well as the interim rate relief we've seen from the CPUC. We also reached our target of mid-teens FFO to debt during 2024 and our forecast shows continuing cash flow growth in 2025, consistent with our strong rate base growth.\nTurning to Slide 14. As you know, we're actively pursuing investment-grade ratings and expect the recent and continuing improvements in our balance sheet and cash flow just discussed ultimately to be reflected in actions by rating agencies. As we consider ways to strengthen the AB 1054 construct, we continue to reinforce with policymakers, the role state policy can play in ensuring the financial health of the state's investor-owned utilities, with customers being key beneficiaries.\nOur simple affordable model, shown here on Slide 15, continues to deliver results for customers. It's how we make our industry-leading capital growth affordable. As I've said before, it's a no big bets approach. We work each element each and every day. O&M savings, where we continue to exceed our annual target. Beneficial load growth approached with a competitive mindset and efficient financing opportunities aggressively pursued, all on the behalf of our customers.\nYou already heard from Patti how we're enabling beneficial load growth, the second element here. On the efficient financing element, lower interest expense from improving credit quality and other financing opportunities help make our critical customer investments more affordable. I'll remind you, our 5-year plan does not assume the savings from the DOE loan, nor achieving investment grade.\nTurning to Slide 16. I am very pleased to share with you that our 2024 nonfuel O&M savings are a 4% reduction over 2023, again, exceeding our 2% target. We've now saved over $200 million in O&M expense in each of the past 3 years, including saving over $500 million in 2023 and nearly another $350 million in 2024. I am now confidently calling this a trend.\nIn 2024, we achieved savings in our inspection program by utilizing a risk-informed checklist to focus on conditions that lead to asset failure. We also found savings through contract rationalization and optimization, and we continue to save on insurance premiums. This is a core capability that we've built here at PG&E, which can deliver future savings year after year. I continue to see abundant opportunities in 2025 and beyond.\nWe will file our general rate case application in May this year, and I look forward to reflecting new savings in our forecast and passing future benefits on to our customers. I see this upcoming filing as another opportunity to do what we say, by delivering on stabilizing builds we continue to build trust with our regulators. Again, performance is power. In the meantime, customers are starting to see the impacts of our continued efforts to stabilize builds this year. Assuming similar usage, combined residential gas and electric bills remained flat January 2025 compared to January 2024.\nTurning to Slide 17. We have an active filing year on the regulatory front. In addition to our GRC this year, we also plan to file our 2026 cost of capital application as well as our 10-year undergrounding plan.\nLastly, here on Slide 18 is a reminder of our value proposition, consistent, predictable performance, serving our customers and delivering for our investors. 10% rate base growth through 2028, 10% core EPS growth in 2025, and at least 9% core EPS growth each year from 2026 through 2028.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. I am confident about this next phase in our story here at PG&E. What was true about PG&E as we enter 2025 is still true today. We're building a culture of performance built on solid foundation of physical and financial safety.\nIn a recent message to my coworkers, I reminded them that the most important thing for us to do today is keep doing our work really well and improving it every day. Given the previous actions taken by policymakers, affirmative statements from the CPUC Chair, and recognition that utility infrastructure investment is essential for California's future and safety of her people, I am confident that we, as a state, will reward your trust in California.\nWe know that when you trust the California regulatory construct and the people who oversee it like I do, you will see that there is no other utility in the sector offering our customer focus, our growth, our operational capability and our valuation upside potential. We are a vital piece of California's infrastructure story, and there is no one better positioned to serve our hometowns at this scale than this team.\nWith that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\nFirst, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com.\nWe'd also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress. Our core earnings per share for the second quarter came in at $0.31, bringing us to $0.69 for the first half. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023, and we're also reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028.\nIn addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024 there have been no changes to our 5-year financing plan, which we shared with you during our first quarter call. Moving to Slide 4. We were excited to see so many of you in June at our investor event in New York City. Our message in New York was that with our layers of physical and financial protections as the foundation, and with our simple, affordable model making critical infrastructure investments affordable for our customers, we see a pathway where electrification can deliver a decarbonized energy future at a lower societal cost.\nAs we discussed in New York, new load is actually a key enabler to lowering the unit cost of electricity eliminating the green premium and enabling a low carbon future. This potential for a cleaner, more resilient energy future at a lower cost to consumers is why we refer to our graphic on this slide as the power pyramid. It's what motivates our team every day here at PG&E. It's our mandate and also our mission. It's beneficial for our customers and it's also good for our investors.\nJust this month, in fact, the CPUC voted out Phase 2 of our general rate case authorizing an incremental $2.3 billion of capital investment for energization with an opportunity to go back in and request more if customers need it. We were encouraged by comments from the commissioners, which supported the thesis that connecting new load can be beneficial for broader customer affordability. At the same meeting, the CPUC approved staff resolution affirming increasing our return on equity to 10.7%. California's regulatory environment is strong. forward-looking and delivers real value for customers and investors.\nUsing the power pyramid as our framework. And turning to Slide 5, a brief update on our performance mitigating physical risk. The bottom line is that our layers of protection strategy has reduced wildfire risk significantly across our service area. I'm sure you've seen plenty of news coverage of recent heat and wind events we've been experiencing in California, and I could not be prouder of our team for their continued tenacity with consistent execution, day in and day out. Take for example, the 8.5 day stretch over the July 4 holiday week. This was the longest duration excessive heat warning ever issued by the National Weather Service Bay Area Office. And it brought in increased system reliability risk as well as elevated wildfire risk. What's important is our readiness posture, no matter the conditions on the ground and the results speak for themselves, no flex alerts and no serious safety incidents.\nOn the reliability front, California has added over 9 gigawatts of capacity in just the last year, and it did the job. The state now also has 10 gigawatts of battery storage that are providing significant benefits in terms of additional flexible supply to the grid. And this is more than double the battery capacity from the same time last year. Overall, our system performed well in the early July heat wave and benefited from numerous proactive steps taken ahead of time. For example, when looking at San Jose data and comparing July performance to the September 2022 heat wave, unplanned and sustained outages were down more than 50%. With the total cumulative duration of those outages, down more than 85%, and the Bay Area region overall saw a 22% reduction in outages.\nThis is climate-resilient infrastructure, in action for new extreme weather norms. On the wildfire front, the key takeaway is that while we've certainly seen a more active start to this year's wildfire season, as of today, we've had no fires of consequence linked to PG&E. We are pleased with this performance given the increased wildfire activity being seen across California. So far this season, we've planned and prepared for 3 PSPS events and executed two, with about 2,000 customers affected in the largest one. Risk is certainly up versus 2023 with our circuit mile days under high-risk conditions, increasing 48% year-to-date and our CPUC reportable ignitions under our 3 or higher conditions, running at 20 year-to-date versus 6 at this time last year.\nThese dynamic conditions require a dynamic response. To prevent ignitions, we have layers of protection as listed on Slide 5, and all of which have been improved year-over-year, including another year of inspections and repairs more vegetation management and more system hardening, both undergrounding and covered conductor. Finally, when conditions warrant, we can turn to public safety power shutoffs. Where we do have ignitions, thanks to EPSS and improved situational awareness tools, including our weather stations, advanced meteorology and fire science models, we have less energy released and faster reaction times as our post ignition mitigations come into play.\nThese include our safety infrastructure protection team made up of 90 former firefighters who protect our assets every day. Our 32 public safety specialists, most of whom are former CAL FIRE, are U.S. Forest Service Chief Officers with at least 30 years of agency leadership experience. Our 24/7 365 hazard awareness Warning Center, over 600 wildfire cameras with AI smoke detection automatically notifying first responders, plus rapid response capabilities, including Black Hawk helicopters equipped to drop water on fire retardants, which we are making available to county fire agencies to supplement the significant state level resources deployed through CAL FIRE.\nOne point I'd like to note is that we've recently completed a third-party risk assessment by Moody's. Analysis using the Moody's RMS wildfire model estimates that our mitigations have reduced the risk of economic loss to PG&E from wildfires by 93%. Going forward, you should expect us to refer to this third-party benchmark, which it is based on a model widely used by the insurance industry to price risk, takes into account a wider range of conditions than the CPUC methodology we referred to in the past, and provides for better comparability across other utilities. The key message is, no matter the conditions, our physical risk mitigations are making our systems safer every day.\nTurning to Slide 6. Financial risk mitigations are also in place through Assembly Bill 1054. These include access to liquidity and improved prudent standard and a cap on shareholder exposure. With our customer funded self-insurance in place since 2023, our near-term financial exposure is limited to $50 million deductible, while our customers benefit from the significant savings compared to commercial insurance. While the benefits of AB 1054 are in place and working as designed, some of you are keen to see the Wildfire Fund reimbursement process in action. Well, during the second quarter, we passed the $1 billion threshold for settle claims related to the 2021 Dixie Fire. This means that we are now eligible to access liquidity from the fund. Our accrual for the Dixie Fire remains $1.6 billion, and the fund previously took a $600 million reserve in anticipation of funding our claims.\nWe've been working closely with the administrator to ensure an orderly reimbursement process beginning as soon as the third quarter with requests for payment to be submitted monthly. We made our first such request earlier in July, and the fund has a statutory requirement to reimburse us within 45 days of claim adjudication. Given that time line, we anticipate having an update on progress with our next quarterly call. California, both physically and financially, has an entirely differentiated safety posture for our citizens and our investors. Wild fire has become a well-understood risk with well-understood mitigation and controls. Moving up our power pyramid.\nHere on Slide 7 is our simple affordable model with our strong existing plan on the left and the opportunity we see for amplification on the right. Execution against this model is how we make needed safety, reliability, and resiliency investments while keeping bills at or below inflation for our customers. Think of this as our runway for additional value for customers and investors. An enduring winning model with no big bets.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and my story of the month. I wanted to share an update from the team working on reinventing our inspections. As a reminder, in June, we shared that using our performance playbook, we are avoiding costs by doing the right work through changes to our inspection strategy. You heard from our team at our Dublin innovation center, that they expect to save over $100 million this year, and that's roughly 50% of our O&M reduction target. Our reinvented process is resulting in less false positives, and the team has already realized $15 million of O&M savings through standard work, aerial inspections and bundling.\nMost importantly, we are identifying the right work and completing it 50% faster than our previous standard. This is the power of our performance playbook, and it's just one example of the culture of performance that we are shaping at PG&E. With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering 3 topics with you. First, our results of the first half of 2024. Second, our continued execution against our simple affordable model; and third, an update on our regulatory progress. Starting here on Slide 9. We are showing you our walk for our first half results. Through June, our quarter earnings of $0.69 are up $0.17 over the first half of last year. Remember that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter, when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023. Adjusting the first half of 2023 for the GRC timing, our results are up $0.10 year-over-year. The uplift is mainly driven by higher customer capital investments.\nNon-fuel O&M savings of $0.03 reflects savings realized by our team reinventing inspections as well as improvements to our contract spend. This is offset by $0.05, reinvested back into the business to fund our emergency response and preparedness programs, and incremental corrosion maintenance just as 2 examples. Turning to Slide 10. We have not changed our CapEx or rate base guidance this quarter. However, the recent GRC Phase II energization decision has further improved our confidence in the potential for upside. Our base plan continues to include $62 billion of customer capital investment over the next 5 years with a focus on distribution and transmission.\nIn terms of customer benefit, our capital plan is balanced, providing safety, enabling new business supporting the clean energy transition and improving reliability and resiliency and we can make it more affordable as we amplify our simple, affordable model. As we reaffirmed in June, we have line of sight into at least another $5 billion of incremental T&D investment and we intend to bring some of this into our plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. We were pleased to see the commission approve their proposed decision in our GRC Phase II implementing provisions of Senate Bill 410 earlier this month.\nThe decision authorizes incremental spend of up to $2.3 billion to fund new energization projects through 2026 and with the potential for additional increases in 2025 and 2026, which we were encouraged to request. This decision has increased our percentage of rate base already authorized and, in our view, is a positive proof point of how we can work constructively with the commission to balance customer needs with affordability, and support California's clean energy transition leveraging the opportunity presented by beneficial load growth. As you know, we plan conservatively and have not yet folded in the full authorized amount to our plan.\nFinally, I'll remind you approval for our Oakland General Office, which was moved out of our 2023 GRC into a separate filing is on the CPUC's consent agenda for August 1. This is another $900 million of rate base. As we shared with you on our first quarter call, we have a strong and balanced financing plan in place to support this capital growth. As shown here on Slide 11, there's no change from what we shared with you last quarter.\nOverall, our plan prioritized its customer capital investments and our commitment to investment-grade ratings while also layering in dividend growth over the next 5 years and meeting our commitment to parent debt paydown. I also want to reinforce that we've built flexibility into our plan. and the equity is already contemplated in our earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028. With our capital and financing plans in place, we are focused on executing against our simple, affordable model to ensure this growth is affordable for customers. Moving to Slide 12. We reducing operating and maintenance costs. As shown, we beat our 2% reduction target in both 2022 and 2023. I believe 3 years will be a trend, and I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress against our target again in 2024, and I am confident that we will meet or exceed our 2% goal. And let me tell you why. In '22 and 2023, large enterprise-level programs helped us come in better than target. Going forward, we can see planning, execution and automation ramping up as our team is trained and executes against our performance playbook, including our lean operating system and breakthrough thinking.\nYou can also expect to see improvements in our capital to expense ratio. This is important for customers because we can avoid costly annual repairs with long-term durable capital. For every dollar of ongoing expense saved, we can invest roughly $7 of capital while holding customer bills flat. Our capital to expense ratio is currently 0.8 in meaning we spend $0.80 of capital for every dollar of expense. Our peers averaged 1.4 in 2022 and improved to 1.6% in 2023. Our 5-year plan would bring us nearly on par with the peer average. And as you can imagine now, we don't plan on settling for average and the best-in-class utilities currently have capital to expense ratios well above 2. The next element of our simple, affordable model is load growth.\nOverall, we're in a differentiated position when it comes to beneficial load growth. Specifically, we are the hometown utility to Silicon Valley, home of AI and innovation and headquarters to major cloud service providers. As Jason Glickman, our Head of Engineering, detailed in June, this Bay area has a vast fiber network and connects to a grid that is majority powered by renewables, making it 1 of 8 primary data center markets in the U.S. We also have one of the largest overlapping electric and gas distribution service areas.\nAnd finally, our state and local policies are driving the need for electrification. I want to emphasize the beneficial load growth is new load that helps to reduce monthly electric bills for our existing customers. It allows us to deliver industry-leading rate base growth and deliver on our plan to keep customer build growth at or below inflation. We share the math here on Slide 13 with you in June, specifically held data centers and even to a larger extent, electric vehicles can improve customer affordability. Specifically, incremental revenue from this new load without a need to modify our tariffs is projected to more than offset the cost of our additional capital needed.\nThe final element of our simple, affordable model is the efficient financing. I am pleased to provide you with an update that we expect to close our final securitization issuance under AB 1054 next week. In aggregate, the 380-1054 issuances support $3.2 billion of safety spend while delivering meaningful financing savings to our customers. As we continue to deliver on our simple, affordable model and meet our commitments, we also see continued progress working with policymakers and stakeholders, as shown on Slide 14. We already discussed the commission's final decision on our GRC capacity phase and their affirmation of our increase to an ROE of 10.7% under the cost of capital adjustment mechanism.\nAdditionally, we continue to work towards final guidelines with our safety regulator, OEIS, for our 10-year undergrounding filing. As we like to say, performance is power, and we're pleased to see our performance reflected in steadily improving credit ratings, as shown here on Slide 15. We're now just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook of both. We will continue to build upon the progress we've made reducing physical risk, improving financial metrics and maintaining strong governance as we remain steadfast in our goal to achieve investment-grade credit at the parent company.\nFinally, here on Slide 16, I'd like to end by leaving you with a reminder of our value proposition. It's one fueled by differentiated performance, placing the customer at the heart of everything we do and delivering 9.5% rate base growth through 2020 at least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% 2025 through 2028. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. Our power pyramid is our differentiated path forward built on the foundation of safety was well understood and well managed wildfire-related physical and financial risk. Our simple affordable model delivers for customers and investors with room to grow. Ultimately, California's aspiration for an electrified economy at a lower societal cost is our destination, and we are well on our way. This is a winning proposition for our customers for the state of California and for you. our investors. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress with our core earnings per share for the first quarter coming in at $0.37. We're also reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $1.33 to $1.37, up at least 10% from 2023.\nAnd we're reaffirming our longer-term earnings per share growth of at least 9% each year starting in 2025 and continuing through 2028. In addition, we remain firm in our commitment to no new equity in 2024. We're also pleased to share with you our 5-year financing plan, which Carolyn will discuss in more detail. What I want to emphasize is that our financing plan does not include the proposed sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.\nAs you may have seen, we continue to advocate for the Pac Gen sale with the CPUC. We see the minority sale as an efficient financing alternative while offering significant benefits to our customers, and it would further strengthen our plan. However, as you can come to expect, we plan conservatively, so the sale is not currently in the plan. The key takeaway is that we are comfortable reaffirming our earnings guidance and our $62 billion capital plan with or without Pac Gen.\nOur plan also enables us to grow our dividend payout to a level closer to our regulated utility peers with $2.5 billion included in the plan through 2028. Consistent with our conservative approach, the plan assumes up to $3 billion of equity starting in 2025, likely through a routine utility ATM program.\nMoving to Slide 4. What I want to impress upon you is this. California and PG&E specifically have a favorable risk profile given significant changes made following catastrophic wildfire events we experienced in our state back in 2017 and 2018. California did the hard work to address challenges to the investor-owned utility model, policymakers passed key legislation.\nAssembly Bill 1054 provides access to liquidity through a wildfire insurance fund with $21 billion of claims paying capacity. Cost recovery under the presumption that the utility's conduct is reasonable with a valid safety certificate, and a cap on shareholder exposure if a portion of our requested cost recovery were to be disallowed by the CPUC.\nThese protections afforded to PG&E under AB 1054 are further complemented by our self-insurance model, which limits shareholder exposure to a deductible of only $50 million, paired with our proven progress mitigating wildfire risk, and significant actions the state has taken to strengthen fire prevention and response in our communities.\nCalifornia stands out as a model for all states that have wildfire risk, and PGE's operating system delivers the physical risk reduction, which further differentiates our story. In fact, we've reduced our wildfire risk by 94% and are working every day to reduce that further.\nAs one additional proof point of our wildfire risk mitigation efforts, I'll remind you here on Slide 5 that in 2023, we reduced ignitions by 68% compared to 2017. And through the end of the first quarter of 2024 on a rolling 12-month basis, our weather-normalized ignition rate remains at 0.93, more than a 70% reduction from 2017.\nAs well as our differentiated wildfire risk reduction framework, we also have a differentiated approach for how we intend to grow our customer capital investments while keeping bills affordable. Here on Slide 6 is our simple affordable model. Since its introduction, we have exceeded our annual nonfuel O&M reduction target every year, reducing O&M by 3% in 2022 and 5.5% in 2023.\nThis is new for PG&E, and it will take repeated performance for our customers and policymakers to believe in the benefit of our new capability and what it delivers for customers. As I like to say, performance is power. When we perform, when we keep our commitments, we have the power to influence the perception of PG&E with our customers and investors. We are differentiated in our potential and our system to deliver on these annual nonfuel O&M savings. Time will prove this out.\nOne exciting element of our simple affordable model is the opportunity for load growth in our service area. Our electric load growth opportunities are not just electric vehicles and data centers but an eventual and necessary decarbonization of our entire economy with clean electricity as the primary energy of the future.\nPG&E is vital to our state's ambition and the need to heal our planet. 1% to 3% loan growth per year in the near term with upwards of 70% load growth over the next 20 years will be required as California moves to carbon neutrality by 2045. California is not afraid to set ambitious targets and has proven repeatedly that we will innovate our way to achieving them.\nCost savings and loan growth, coupled with continued efficient financing options are how we can execute on our commitment here on Slide 7 to control average annual bill increases to 2% to 4%. We appreciate that near-term build pressure due to consolidated years of GRC recovery and catch-up recovery of wildfire mitigation expense is difficult for some of our customers, and I look forward to the day when we can announce that customers' prices are coming down.\nAt the same time, we stand by the need for the near-term increase as this GRC is funding critical work, which is making our customers and communities safer than ever before. Here on Slide 8 are just a few examples of important safety and reliability work funded by our GRC. Installation of more than 10,000 devices for situational awareness, system hardening, automation and reliability, repair or replacement of over 175,000 units on our distribution lines.\nInspection of $2 million and replacement of over 60,000 poles, replacement of more than 160 miles of gas distribution pipeline and undergrounding of 1,230 miles of distribution lines in high fire risk areas. As we perform this work, it is our responsibility to ensure every customer dollar is put to maximum use, which brings us to my story of the month here on Slide 9.\nYou may recall that last year, I shared a story on work bundling. Specifically, I highlighted an example of cross-functional bundling where we planned and executed 12 jobs under one planned outage. I also left you with a little teaser saying, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Well, my coworkers are now rolling out our next generation of work bundling with something we refer to as mega bundles.\nUsing breakthrough thinking and our lean operating system, we've identified over 9,000 individual scopes of work and converted them into 20 bundled projects. With mega bundling, we're looking at an entire circuit as 1 project. In the past, we plan and execute work at a granular level. For example, we roll a truck to replace a single pole or just 1 switch. When we look at an entire circuit, we may find 100 poles that need to be replaced.\nIn Stockton, for example, we have 1 circuit with nearly 1,000 poles that will be completed this year. Bundling these pulls into a single project improve safety, the customer experience, quality, cost, delivery and coworker morale. Imagine assembly line style production. The potential for 1 permit for hundreds of poles rather than hundreds of separate permits as it is today, seeking multiple pole holes per day in a specific region, resulting in significant fuel savings and less hazardous drive time for our coworkers.\nFraming hundreds of poles at a time using manufacturing style production off-site rather than one by one on site. And customer outreach to entire neighborhoods, reduced outages and lane closures versus one job at a time. This approach also allows us to negotiate better contract pricing and reduced overhead costs.\nOverall, with mega bundling, we expect to see cost savings of at least 20% compared to historical all-in cost, which will result in at least $20 million of our customers' dollars saved just this year, freeing up resources to do even more safety and reliability work for our customers.\nWhen I joined PG&E, you may have heard one of my early observations. We're very good at engineering equipment, but we're not very good at engineering our work. Well, that's changing, thanks to our performance playbook. We are delivering improved performance every day, which serves both customers and investors.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carolyn to walk you through the financial details.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm looking forward to covering 4 topics with you: first, our quarterly results; second, our 5-year financing plan; third, our continued execution against our simple, affordable model; and fourth, an update on our regulatory process.\nStarting here with our first quarter walk on Slide 10. Our first quarter core earnings of $0.37 are up $0.08 over the first quarter last year. Remember, that our general rate case was approved in the fourth quarter when we booked the catch-up revenues for all of 2023.\nAdjusting first quarter 2023 for the GRC timing, our first quarter results are up $0.05 year-over-year. This improvement is primarily driven by an increase in customer capital investment. And our CPUC rate base now provides an equity return of 10.7% as approved through the adjusted cost of capital mechanism advice letter.\nAs a reminder, we said that we were not counting on this increase to meet our earnings guidance but it does give us more flexibility to redeploy resources for the benefit of our customers. Other drivers include nonfuel O&M savings of $0.01 offset by $0.02 reinvested back into the business to fund more work, such as increased transmission system inspections and electric acid mapping.\nAlso this quarter, we revised our estimate for the duration of the wildfire fund established under AB 1054. Based on all the data available to us, including the progress we've achieved in reducing physical wildfire risk on our system, the fund will provide coverage for 20 years, beds up from our previous estimate of 15 years. Another example of how AB 1054 is working as intended.\nTurning to Slide 11. There are no changes to our CapEx or rate base guidance. Our plan includes $62 billion of customer investment over the next 5 years, and we still have at least another $5 billion to pull into the plan once we make it affordable for both our customers and our balance sheet. And please keep in mind that in 2024, 93% of our rate base has already been authorized with 90% authorized out in 2026.\nThis is higher than most utilities given our 4-year GRC cycle, and we continue to pursue cost recovery to increase that percentage. As an example, we filed an application for our gas metering replacement program last month, seeking revenue requirement to support nearly $500 million in capital additions from 2023 through 2026. That's in addition to the request filed late last year for revenue requirement to support the capital costs associated with moving our headquarters from San Francisco to Oakland.\nHere on Slide 12. Again, no changes from what we shared with you on our year-end call. Our operating cash flow grew substantially from $5 billion last year to $8 billion this year. This reflects collection of both our 2023 GRC revenue increase and 2024 GRC revenues as well as the catch-up recoveries of our prior work, including interim rate relief. Our operating cash flow continues to rise through the plan period, reflecting our growing capital investment on behalf of customers.\nIn total, we're forecasting $50 billion in operating cash flow from 2024 through 2028. Turning to Slide 13. With $50 billion as the starting point, we are pleased to share our 5-year financing plan to support our $62 billion of capital investment. As Patti mentioned, our financing plan does not include the proposed Pac Gen minority interest sale, which would further strengthen what we're showing here.\nNow for the highlights. First, we plan to grow our dividend over the next 5 years. Given our commitment to prioritize customer capital investment in the near term, we anticipate growing the dividend more slowly at the front end of our plan, with the payout stepping up more quickly in the later years. In the meantime, we are benefiting from nearly $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings this year, and we consider this a valuable source of internally generated equity.\nSecond, we forecast incremental utility long-term debt needs of approximately $14 billion. Third, we continue with our plan to reduce our parent company debt by $2 billion by the end of 2026. Finally, we are contemplating raising new over the 2025 to 2028 planning horizon, likely through a routine ATM program. This supports our $62 billion customer capital investment and our consistent earnings guidance of at least 10% this year and at least 9% each and every year through 2028.\nImportantly, our commitment to no new equity in 2024 remains firm. In developing this plan, we had several key objectives in mind for our customers and our investors. One, funding the significant safety and reliability investments our customers deserve. Two, keeping customer bills affordable, and [ regain ] 2% to 4% assumed inflation; three, delivering on our premium earnings per share growth; and four, achieving solid investment-grade ratings.\nWe want to reinforce that final objective here on Slide 14. We're targeting investment-grade ratings at the corporate level. And since 2020, our ratings have improved steadily with all 3 agencies. We're now just one notch below investment grade at both Moody's and Fitch and on positive outlook at both. The recent improvements in our ratings are progress since 2020, especially mitigating wildfire risk.\nOur 5-year financing plan is designed to build on the progress we've made in all of these areas, and reflects our laser food areas and reflects our laser focus on improving the balance sheet. And as a reminder, our operating cash flow increases $3 billion from $5 billion in 2023 to $8 billion in 2024, with continued growth through the plan period.\nThis growing operating cash flow supports improving credit metrics, including our mid-teens goal for FFO to debt. We also generate reinvestment dollars every year as we execute on our simple, affordable model, as shown here on Slide 15.\nI'll remind you that in 2023, we realized net cost savings of just over $500 million. Mega bundling, which Patti discussed is just one more example of the wealth of opportunities we see here at PG&E to deliver more for our comers while keeping build growth in the 2% to 4% range.\nMoving to Slide 16. Our progress working with policymakers continues. Just during March, we saw a number of constructive regulatory decisions, which together, accelerate well over $1 billion of cash flow. On March 7, the CPUC approved interim rate release in net amount of $516 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application moves through the typical process.\nNext, on March 15, the Commission's Executive Director approved our request to delay until 2025, [ $615 million ] established as part of our rate neutral securitization. And finally, on March 20, the commission issued a proposed decision denying the petition for modification filed by joint rate payers to suspend the formula cost of capital adjustment mechanism for 2024.\nThe proposed decision finds that the mechanism operated as intended. It also offers strong regulatory support for our return on equity. In terms of Pac Gen, we continue to believe this transaction is highly beneficial for customers. It has clear potential to lower bills while accelerating our return to investment grade and bringing in a partner to invest in these assets, which are key to California's energy transition.\nWe appreciate the commission wanting to take some time -- some additional time before making a final decision. Looking ahead, as you know, the California's legislature has passed a series of constructive measures, which have the potential to add upside to our plan and important benefits to our customers. This legislation, including Senate Bill 410 and 884 continues to move through the regulatory implementation stages.\nRegarding SB 410, a proposed decision in Phase 2 of our general rate case, which we're now calling the capacity phase is scheduled for later this quarter. This would authorize CapEx to support energization incremental to what was approved in our GRC. Regarding SB 884 on March 7, the commission approved a resolution establishing CPUC guidelines for approving undergrounding plans.\nWe remain prepared to file our 10-year undergrounding plan later this year when our safety regulator is ready to accept our submission. I'll end here on Slide 17 with a reminder of our value proposition, 9.5% rate base growth through 2028, at least $5 billion of incremental investment opportunities. At least 10% core earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 through 2028.\nGrowing momentum around credit ratings with 2 agencies, Moody's and Fitch, now just one notch below investment grade and with positive outlook and the continued consistent execution of our simple affordable model. delivering both for our customers and you, our investors.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Carolyn. As I reflect on the progress we've made over the last 3 years, just imagine our performance in the next 3. With the wildfire-related legal and regulatory protections in place and with our physical and financial risk mitigation progress well understood and managed, we look to the energy transition in front of us and see nothing but opportunities.\nThe future California energy system calls on PG&E to deliver the clean electricity of the future. Growth will fuel the simple affordable model and California's economy. We can't wait to share more with you at the New York Stock Exchange for our investor update on June 12.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

I would now like to welcome Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin the call. Jonathan, over to you.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Officer. We also have our members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWith that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported full year core earnings of $1.23, delivering at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result represents growth of 12% over our 2022 results of $1.10.\nIn the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year benefit of our 2023 general rate case as expected. I'm also pleased to announce that we exceeded our 2% annual nonfuel O&M savings target for the second consecutive year with savings coming in at 5.5% and pushing our EPS to the high end of the range. Because these savings were predominantly generated by reducing waste and improving service, they benefit customers today and benefit investors for years to come. Looking to 2024, we're reaffirming our at least 10% growth target, which is now based on our actual 2023 result of $1.23. This results in an increase to our 2024 core earnings guidance range with a new higher midpoint of $1.35 versus our previous guidance of $1.33. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 9% core EPS growth for both 2025 and 2026, rebased off our actual 2023 results and our new 2024 range.\nIn addition, I'm pleased to share that we're extending our core EPS growth guidance of at least 9% for an additional 2 years through 2028. Our needed customer investment leads to strong rate base growth which continues to be the primary driver of our future earnings growth. We are providing you with updated 5-year forecast for both rate base and CapEx in today's slides. These numbers now extend to 2028 and show a consistent compound annual growth rate of 9.5%, using the new base year of 2023. Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to no new equity in 2024 and remain committed to pursuing the most efficient forms of financing available for 2025 and beyond, which Carolyn will discuss in her remarks.\nOn Slide 4, we've added 23 actuals, illustrating our high end of guidance results and the rebasing of forward year growth rates now through 2028. This is our simple, affordable model in action. The lift in 2023 reflects our 5.5% nonfuel O&M reduction, well above our 2% plan.\nSlide 5 is a reminder of the key elements of our simple affordable model, which allows us to continue growing customer capital investment at 9% or more, while containing customer bill increases at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range. Key enablers in the model are ongoing annual nonfuel O&M reductions of 2%, efficient financing and electric load growth in the 1% to 3% range. The proof is in the numbers. The simple, affordable model works.\nYou first saw Slide 6 during our November business update call. This version has been updated for a few additional known items such as the 2024 cost of capital trigger. Our new ROE of 10.7% took effect on January 1 this year with collections beginning this month in gas rates and next month for electric. Delivering on this projected 2% to 4% bill growth trajectory is an essential element of the PG&E plan, and one which will be important for building trust with our customers over the long run. For our average gas and electric residential customer. Average monthly bill increases are limited to the 2% to 4% range from 2023 through 2026. I wanted to be clear that this includes the step-up in 2024 as we implement the GRC and other deferred cost recoveries. Our plan shows average build stepping down beginning later this year and further in both 2025 and 2026, keeping the average annual increase in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range as catch-up recoveries roll off. Two of the larger items are around $1 billion of 2022 WMCE interim rate relief, which comes off builds in mid-2024 and the 24-month collection of our first year GRC revenues, which come off at the start of 2026. Let me say that again. Based on what we know today, our bills will rise at the lower half of the range, around 2.5% per year, on average, for the duration of this rate case from 2023 through 2026.\nLet's shift gears to the significant progress the team has made on risk mitigation. Slide 7 updates our 2023 emission data for the full year. Total CPUC reportable admissions came in at [ 65 ] for 2023, down 68% from the 2017 baseline and 29% down from 2022. On the right side of the slide, we're showing our weather-normalized ignition rate, which is a metric from our wildfire mitigation plan. This year's number of [ 0.93 ] was a reduction of 71% from 2017, and our lowest annual number since we began calculating this metric. The metric demonstrates that we continue to drive down wildfire risk in 2023, even after adjusting for fewer circuit mile days under R3 or higher conditions, when the risk of catastrophic wildfire are highest. While we're extremely pleased with these results, our team certainly isn't stopping here. We see further opportunities to drive overall wildfire risk reduction beyond the 94% achieved in 2023 as we continue with additional system hardening and deployment of new technology. In addition to the physical risk reduction, financial risks are also lower, including key protections under AB 1054, which were reaffirmed with the issuance of our annual safety certificate last month.\nLooking forward, here on Slide 8, we want to take a moment to highlight how we see PG&E offering investors a truly differentiated, high-quality utility growth story. This starts with premium rate base growth and industry-leading 9.5%. What sets us apart is our commitment to make this investment affordable for our customers. The key enabler is our ability to drive consistent nonfuel O&M savings as we deploy our lane operating system in a utility, which previously saw costs compound at an annual 10% rate over the prior 5 years. As a reminder, several years of doing whatever was necessary to respond to back-to-back crisis pushed our capital to expense ratio far below the industry average. This is where we have a wealth of opportunity and a long runway to drive efficiencies with sustainable savings benefiting both our customers and our investors. We expect future load growth related to California's leadership in electrification to be a further differentiator and one which will help keep customer build growth within our 2% to 4% forecast. In addition to continued adoption of electric vehicles throughout our service territory, we have seen a threefold increase in data center applications in 2023 versus the prior 4 years. We plan to speak more about these load growth trends over the course of this year, including at an investor meeting, which we are planning for June 12 in New York. So please mark your calendars for that. the fundamental differentiators of rate base growth, O&M savings and load growth, we would add our constructive state regulatory and policy environment in California. Key elements of the California regulatory model includes 4 years of revenue certainty under the GRC, returns, which are set separately from the GRC, including a formulaic adjustment mechanism, and timely recovery for pass-through of important cost categories, including fuel and pension. With our GRC results, we now have revenue certainty extended through 2026 and giving us the best level of regulatory visibility we've had since I joined PG&E and something which any regulated utility would lose. This brings me to our performance playbook, including our lean operating system, which is becoming a critical differentiator for PG&E as we continue building a sustainable culture based on continuous improvement and what we refer to as breakthrough thinking.\nAnd so on Slide 9 to my story of the month or in this case, the story of the year. Let me first take you back to the beginning of 2023. We had a goal to underground 350 miles of electric lines at a unit cost of $3.3 million per mile. We started 2023 with only about 5 miles of civil construction fully complete. At that point, we had hundreds of miles still to design, thousands of individual easements to negotiate 345 miles of trenches to dig and 350 miles of cable to pull. And then the winter storm hit. [ This came ] atmospheric rivers to be exact, which brought civil work to a near standstill through April. So how did we deliver on 2023 undergrounding plan, as scoped on time and at better-than-targeted unit cost performance. Well, during a visit with our Board of Directors in December, I watch proudly as the undergrounding team described how they use the PG&E performance playbook every day and at every level. What they shared wasn't one silver bullet, not just a breakthrough idea or a value stream map or waste elimination rather it was this team's commitment to living the culture, using the tools and building the capabilities that enabled our results and which will cause future success. In 2023 alone, the undergrounding team eliminated $68 million in waste for the benefit of our customers. They did this by updating our standards, deploying optimal construction methods and better managing spoils. With additional improvements, average unit costs came in below our target of $3.3 million to just under $3 million per mile and the average construction cycle time improved from 5.5 months back in February 2023, to 3.5 months today. This was a total game changer in meeting and exceeding our 350-mile goals. Thanks to our 2023 undergrounding efforts, we can avoid proactively turning off power to about 15,000 households during dangerous high wind events. These customers who live in our highest risk areas can now sleep at night knowing they do not have to trade safety for reliability or worry that a tree might land on the power line in their backyard. This is climate resilient infrastructure for all weather conditions and for generations to come. The team reminded us that before lean we would have managed the undergrounding effort through spreadsheets and phone calls. That was the old PG&E way. Undergrounding team is showing us the new PG&E. Imagine the impact our performance playbook can have enterprise-wide. It's great that we achieved our 2023 goal. What's even better is that we've created a playbook enabling consistent premium performance year-end and year out. As I like to say, performance is power. This means safe, affordable and reliable service to our hometowns, along with consistent, predictable financial results.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm excited to cover 3 topics with you. First, a recap of our 2023 results; second, our differentiated growth opportunities; and third, how are we making this growth affordable for our customers by executing on our simple affordable model.\nStarting here on Slide 10, I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our 2023 goals, both operational and financial, and we're on track for each of our longer-term commits. Our 2023 report card is another proof point that our performance playbook is working. The culture and capabilities we are building here at PG&E are enabling our delivery of consistent, predictable results. It's a virtuous cycle, setting industry-leading targets using our lean operating system to manage the day-to-day work and then delivering on our bonuses, building trust with our customers and our investors. This is how we've made our system safer faster. It's how we delivered on our 2022 and 2023 EPS guidance, and it's how we can further strengthen our balance sheet while keeping bills affordable for our customers. I'm especially proud that we reduced nonfuel operating and maintenance costs by 5.5% in 2023. That's in addition to fully absorbing inflation and on top of the 3% we achieved in 2022. Looking forward, we see no shortage of opportunities to continue delivering better outcomes for customers at a lower cost, all across the business. I'd note that not all of the 2023 reduction hit the bottom line. with the majority directly benefiting customers, including our self-insurance solution and substantial efficiencies in our vegetation management work. Our mid-teens by 2024 FFO to debt target is on track, and there is no change to our plan to reduce parent company debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. We remain firmly committed to achieving solid investment-grade ratings. In December, we were pleased to see S&P revised their rating outlook from stable to positive, indicating the potential for an upgrade in the next 12 months. And earlier this week, I'm delighted to say that Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch, also leaving us some positive outlook. This puts us one notch away from investment grade and one step closer to our goal. We value the support we received from our regulators, helping us strengthen our balance sheet while we execute our plan to affordably serve customers and investors. For example, on February 1, the commission issued a proposed decision authorizing interim rate relief in the amount of $560 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application is pending. The interim leaf may be voted on as early as March 7 and would provide for collection to start as soon as practical over a 12-month period.\nMoving to Slide 11. As you can see here, and as expected, the largest discrete driver of fourth quarter and full year results was the approval of our 2023 general rate case, which added $0.15. We also saw a benefit of $0.03, partly attributed to our nonfuel O&M savings, including better resource management and improved planning and execution. Please recall that our O&M savings are part of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to complete more work for the benefit of our customers while delivering affordability. That's exactly what you see here with $0.05 of redeployment. Our savings allowed us to stand up 10 additional model yards designed to improve frontline productivity with more efficient processes, minimizing rework and eliminating waste as we deliver for our customers. We also provided additional training resources for our coworkers, and we accelerated inspections going forward work to protect 2024 and ensuring we're doing the highest priority work for our customers. We use every extra resource to better serve our customers and achieve our commitments to you, our investors. We weathered the ups and downs to deliver consistent, predictable results. As Patti highlighted, we ended 2023 at the top of our EPS guidance range. although our core philosophy remains to redeploy excess earnings back into the system, benefiting customers while derisking and extending premium growth on behalf of investors.\nOn Slide 12. We are extending our CapEx and rate base growth projections another year to include 2028, showing a 5-year annual rate base growth of 9.5%. Our new 5-year capital plan represents an increase of over $10 billion or approximately 20% over the 2023 to 2027 plans. This also is 45% higher than the previous 5-year period from 2019 to 2023. The amounts shown on this slide reflect our base capital plan, including how much our rate base is already approved by regulators. The vast majority or 93% of our rate base for this year is already authorized as is 90% of our 2026 forecast. In addition to our plan, there are substantial needs to do more. Specifically, we have at least an incremental $5 billion of CapEx opportunities, which we will seek to fold into our plan while still meeting our affordability commitments. These include capacity investments and transmission upgrades to support continued system-wide growth. As we work to drive affordability under our simple, affordable model and ongoing deployment of lead we will look for opportunities to add this important work.\nAs you know, this capital investment fuels both earnings growth and improves our operating cash flow, as illustrated on Slide 13, which we have updated and extended since we first showed it at last year's Investor Day. As shown, we're projecting substantial improvement in our operating cash flow in 2024, partly as a result of the final GRC decision. Operating cash flow grows from $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion by 2028, providing resources to grow our capital investment for customers from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $14 billion in 2028 and substantially improving our cash flow before dividends. As Patti mentioned, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024. As we look forward, we have many good efficient financing choices, including close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today and rising from there at our present low level of dividend payout, half of our funding provided from normal utility debt, substantial levels of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions, for working capital improvements, the sale of a minority interest in our nonnuclear generation assets and potentially reintroducing an at the market or ATM equity program 2025. While we are not giving the final mix of our 2025 financing and today, rest assured that our plan only includes choices, which are accretive to our guidance. In light of this, we are extending our core EPS growth rate of at least 9% through 2027 and 2028.\nMoving to Slide 14. This is our simple affordable model and a breakdown of the 5.5% O&M savings last year. Patti shared details about our undergrounding achievements in 2023, and there are many more similar stories throughout the business. I'll share just one more with you today. At our Investor Day, you heard about improvements we were making to the new customer connections process by leveraging our performance playbook. Now here's how we ended the year. The team was able to save $24 million while decreasing average end-to-end lead time by 13%. That's a 50-day reduction. We also reduced engineering design time by 33%, a 37-day reduction. As a result, customer on-time delivery improved by 25 percentage points. I share this example to make an important point. This is not a cost-cutting program at PG&E. This is about good business decisions, which are sustainable for the long term, and it's about using the performance playbook, including the lean operating system to improve how we do our work every day. Our actions are improving the customer experience and making capital and safety investments affordable.\nI'll end here on Slide 15 with regulatory catalysts on the horizon in 2024. As you can see, they are still plentiful and include resolution of our proposed Pac Gen sale, a post decision in Phase 2 of our GRC implementing Senate Bill 410 and unlocking our potential to meet the new customer demand here in California, filing of our 10-year undergrounding plan and bring in our $5 billion of incremental capital opportunities into the plan while still meeting our affordability goals. Finally, I'll comment on our cost of capital adjustment advice letter, which was approved by commission staff in December, raising our allowed ROE from 10% to 10.7% and truing up our cost of debt. While this adjustment is already approved and in customer rates starting this month, in January, a joint intervenor group filed a late request for a review of SaaS approval. While we recognize this creates some uncertainty for investors we were pleased that the commission staff upheld operation of the adjustment mechanism in December as intended. Intervenors offered no new fundamental arguments in their request for review, and we look forward to this issue being resolved expeditiously. In the meantime, as we have said consistently, our EPS growth guidance is not dependent on the outcome and we value the opportunity to redeploy the revenue uplift for the benefit of customers while delivering consistent, predictable results for investors. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024 and beyond, including our 10% core EPS growth guidance and our at least 9% growth rate now extended through 2028.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, let me introduce our new report card here on Slide 16, against which you'll be able to track our record of differentiated performance. We're showing our results for 2022 and 2023 along with our goals for 2024 and beyond. We believe we have a differentiated plan and the right team in place to deliver on these objectives. As I said earlier, performance is power, and we have significant operational momentum with a healthy set of catalysts in front of us. The PG&E turnaround is on track. We trust you feel the momentum as we do. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences as well as our investor meeting scheduled for June 12 in New York.\nWith that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you, Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJonathan P.

With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures.\nThe slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com.\nWe would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. With that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid progress.\nAs you'll see on Slide 3, our core earnings per share of $0.24 for the third quarter bring us to $0.76 for the first 9 months of 2023. We continue to work through the review process of our general rate case at the California Public Utilities Commission and have, therefore, not yet recognized the benefit in our earnings. With the customary memo account in place, once we receive the final order, we will book the new GRC revenues starting from the January 1, 2023 effective date.\nAs you may know, our general rate case is on the agenda for CPUC's November 2 voting meeting next week, and we trust that the commission appreciates the importance of reaching a timely and constructive resolution, one which provides sufficient cash flow to support the critical work we have in front of us. If the GRC is not voted out next week, there are 2 further voting meetings in November one on the 16th and one on the 30th.\nResolving our GRC will be a key milestone as it sets our CPUC base revenue through 2026. While we await the final decision, our memo account allows us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2024 and at least 9% in both 2025 and 2026, along with our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024.\nLooking ahead, once we have the final GRC decision, we anticipate scheduling a follow-up investor call, and we look forward to providing you with a more granular update on our financial plan at the time. Then on our year-end call in February, you should expect further detail around our investment plans.\nWith respect to reinstating our common dividend, we recognize how important this is to traditional utility and income investors, and we look forward to recommending this important step to our Board soon.\nTurning back to our GRC. In our filed comments with the CPUC as well as in our public advocacy, we have been vocal that we view the ALJ's proposed decision or PD and the assigned commissioner's alternate proposal proposed decision, or APD, as falling short of providing the funding to accomplish the necessary safety work we have proposed on behalf of customers.\nAs we have said, we are disappointed at the PDs apparent willingness to trade safety and reliability for short-term cost considerations. This is critical work, and in many cases, work that is required for us to execute on the safety commitments we make in our annual wildfire mitigation plan or under other regulatory orders.\nOne good example, and there are others, is that the current PDs declined to fund over $260 million of capital for corrective maintenance of our gas meters. This work is not optional and is, in fact, required for compliance with CPUC General Order 588, which sets the statewide standards for gas service in California. Unless the CPUC makes meaningful changes to the cash flow elements of the current PDs, we will have to slow down making our system safer and delay meeting legislative directives and regulatory requirements. My management team and I stand for delivering safety, reliability and affordability.\nWe believe that our plan, thanks to the simple affordable model offers a clear pathway to keep build growth well below the current level of inflation at 2% to 4% annually over the rate case period. The CPUC's GRC process is designed to get the best outcome, and the state has been very clear about the infrastructure they want us to build. We stand by our filing and continue to view our undergrounding plan as the fastest and most affordable path to keep our customers safe. To that end, we have been encouraged by significant statements of support received from our local leaders and stakeholders.\nAside from the GRC on Slide 4, we continue to mitigate physical and financial risk. On the physical side, we're pleased with our continued progress mitigating wildfire risk through our layers of protection strategy. This remains at the heart of our plan, and we stand unapologetically on the side of public safety. In Sacramento, this year's legislative session included a number of bills which sought to address the very real challenges utilities have had keeping up with customer growth. Since our last update, the SB 410 energization bill was passed by the legislature and slided into law by Governor Newsom.\nWe viewed SB410 as a constructive solution, allowing us to deliver the necessary work for our customers with more timely cost recovery. One key provision is for the CPUC to establish a ratemaking mechanism allowing for recovery of energization investment above what is approved in our GRC. We believe this is appropriate given the fast-moving and unpredictable nature of electrification-related customer demand and emerging and high-quality problem for any utility would love to have.\nIn the newly opened Phase 2 of our GRC, we've proposed a new balancing account to implement the provisions of SB410. Keeping affordability in mind, our proposal would cap annual incremental customer bill impact at 2.5% of electric distribution rates. This could amount to over $200 million of annual revenue, supporting close to $1.5 billion of increase of incremental capital investment. The ratemaking mechanism in addition to the GRC authorized funding will allow an estimated 300-plus distribution capacity projects and over 35,000 new business connections over the next 3 years if the proposed rate-making mechanism is adopted.\nAs with the pending GRC decision, it's critical that the Phase 2 proceeding support the necessary cash flow and timely resolution to do the work our legislature has directed and on the time line our customers are requesting. Since our last call, we've also made progress on legacy legal risk, reaching a settlement with the CPUC's Safety and Enforcement Division with respect to the Dixie fire. This was for $45 million, most to be spent on the new electronic record system over 5 years.\nWe continue to maintain we were a prudent operator and our settlement with SED specifically preserves our ability to apply for cost recovery, both from the CPUC and from the state Wildfire Fund.\nTurning to Slide 5. Our layers of protection strategy continue to underpin our approach to wildfire risk as we strive to make our communities safer each and every day. We've now completed the work, which improves our risk reduction from 90% at the start of the year to 94%, in line with our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan. Much of this year's improvement relates to installing down conductor detection technology, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings and public safety power shutoff programs.\nOther improvements this year include securing a approval for beyond line of sight drone inspections and integration of artificial intelligence for smoke detection on 610 cameras covering over 91% of PG&E's high fire risk areas.\nOur latest wildfire mitigation plan is working through the review process with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety or OEIS. Last month, we submitted our supplemental response to their revision notice and their updated schedule calls for a draft decision by November 14 with a final decision by December 29.\nAs directed, we're expecting to file for our 2023 safety certificate by December 12. And remember that under AB 1054, the current certificate remains in full force, while OEIS reviews the new request.\nTurning slide 6. Let's review our wildfire season performance to date. First, we are pleased to report that we are on track with our primary goal of zero catastrophic wildfire ignitions associated with PG&E equipment. .\nAs of October 22, CPUC reportable admissions in our high-risk zones are down 27% from last year and down 67% from 2017. The extended period of winter storms we experienced in 2023 certainly delayed the start of fire season, but this also led to an abundance of growth and fuel once conditions dried out.\nWhile we are really pleased with the headline data, variances and weather conditions from year-to-year can create some comparability challenges. To account for this, we track a weather-normalized ignition rate. We expressed this as ignitions per 100,000 circuit mile days under R3 or higher conditions, as measured by our Fire Potential Index.\nWe've seen the ignition rate decline by 70% overall since 2017, including significant step-downs in 2021 and 2022, validating our layers of protection approach. This year, through mid-October, I am pleased to report that we've seen our weather-normalized ignition rate come down by a further 7% versus 2022.\nOne point I want to reinforce, at PG&E, we're ready every day for dangerous conditions. Our layers of protection do not rely on weather being in our favor. We've implemented state-of-the-art situational readiness technology, tools and people -- we treat every day as a high-risk day. This is the mindset that will protect our customers and our communities. No matter the conditions we are ready.\nA good example is our use of public safety power shutoffs. Last year, we didn't need to activate any PSPS events since we did not experience sufficiently high-risk wind conditions. This year, we've initiated two PSPS events, one in August and one in September, and both were quite localized.\nThrough our enhanced situational awareness, which breaks the system down into 2-kilometer polygons, along with our extensive use of data and advanced meteorology, we are continuing to refine our PSPS capabilities. Our program is now far more surgical than when we first rolled it out in 2018. Because of those improvements, our PSPS events only affected around 3,900 customers in August and 1,200 in September. Our post-event analysis shows that our 2023 shutoffs prevented to likely ignitions and close to 30,000 acres, which might have otherwise burned.\nWe are standing for our hometown and are resolved the catastrophic wildfires shall stop. PSPS and EPSS our enhanced Powerline safety settings program have been very effective at reducing ignitions. But both present unacceptable reliability challenges for customers. That's why we see undergrounding as the right long-term infrastructure for the very specific high-risk miles identified in our 10,000-mile plan and affordable for customers at $3.40 per month for the average noncare residential customers. In fact, based on our analysis over the expected life of the assets to be installed during the GRC period, our proposal returns billions of dollars more in net present value compared to the APD.\nJust like our layers of physical protection, our financial plan also includes multiple layers of protection as illustrated on Slide 7. The orange wedge represents the difference between the APD rate base and our guidance midpoint. Most critically, our layers of protection include improving on the cash elements of the rate case PDs, which we are working hard to do in our advocacy.\nThere are also three items where the PDs do not recommend this allowances, but instead shift cost recovery into other future proceedings. These include future Whimsy or equivalent filings incremental spending on energization as provided under SB 410 and our 10-year undergrounding plan under SB 884.\nWe also see no shortage of incremental investment headroom in our FERC jurisdiction rate base. Keep in mind that capital investment for the benefit of customers' needs can be offset with O&M reductions and efficient financing, along with low growth to make sure safe infrastructure is also affordable. This is the heart of our simple, affordable model. Our regulators and key stakeholders are just becoming familiar with this model. and we must implement it in a very trustworthy way so that California can have the modern infrastructure in place that keeps people safe and energized, which takes me to my story of the month on Slide 8.\nA couple of weeks ago, I visited a site in Vacaville, where my coworkers are burying lines in a high-fire threat area. The project manager and field engineer were on site and could not have been more excited about what they were accomplishing for their home talent. This undergrounding project was originally estimated to cost close to $3.5 million a mile with a completion date in 2024. The team is now estimating a unit cost of approximately $2.9 million a mile and finishing in early December.\nUsing Lean and the principles of waste elimination, my coworkers found opportunities to reduce materials and labor costs by challenging the status quo. They reduce trench depth and width while staying in compliance with county standards and they found additional cost savings during the backfill process. The combination of these solutions brought down the unit cost and they reduced total active construction time, making it safer, faster and reducing the impact on the community.\nAs you can imagine, each project comes with its unique challenges, and this one was no different. What is different now at PG&E is the standard set of tools and the mindset that my coworkers bring to every job. It's consistent application of lean and problem solving that drives predictable and in some cases, extraordinary breakthrough results no matter what challenges we face. Sticking with undergrounding, I should note that we currently have more than 2,000 qualified personnel working safely on undergrounding in our service territory every day.\nEarlier this month, we announced that we had finished 100% of the heavy construction work necessary to complete the 350 miles targeted for this year. We expect to energize an average of 20 additional miles per week through the end of the year, and I could not be prouder of the team for overcoming the significant challenges presented by the weather we experienced earlier this year. Day by day, week by week, we are managing our progress, leveraging visual management and operating reviews, giving me the confidence to affirm that we are right on track with our plan for 2023 and with line of sight running well into 2024. And with that, let me hand you over to Carolyn for our financial highlights.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover three main topics with you. Our 2023 year-to-date results, why we feel confident reaffirming our year-end and longer-term outlook and our simple affordable model.\nLet's start with our 2023 report card here on Slide 9. As Patti discussed earlier, we are solidly on track with our operational metrics. We also have confidence that we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments.\nToday, we are reaffirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, along with our EPS growth target of at least 10% for 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. We are also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. We may have noticed our Amber dial signaling a potential challenge to reaching our FFO to debt target in 2024.\nWhile we remain committed to achieving our mid-teens FFO to debt as quickly as possible, as discussed in our public comments throughout the past several weeks, the PD and APB in our general rate case fall short on cash flow in two notable areas. First, both the PD and APD extend the amortization period for collecting our incremental 2023 revenue increases to 36 months, packing an additional 2 years onto our requested 12-month collection period. This longer amortization period pushes out cash flow and unnecessarily [ burden our ] customers in the form of additional interest cost.\nSecond, the APD allows only 25% of the customary inflation index adjustment, which risks lowering the pace of our balance sheet recovery as intervening parties acknowledge that last week's oral argument, our request and the index supporting it are consistent with commission precedent. Taken together, these cuts will constrain future cash flows. And as we've said to the commission, we will be forced to make some difficult choices on what priority work to dial back on and what to complete.\nWe simply are not willing to compromise on safety. Nor can the state afford to see us take a step backwards in terms of the progress we've made improving our credit metrics. As Patti mentioned, we are advocating strongly for improvements in the PD. And we trust the CPU understands the importance of a financially healthy utility, just as we understand the importance of keeping bills affordable for customers. The simple affordable model makes both financial health and affordability possible.\nTurning to Slide 10. As we've said, we are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. On a year-to-date basis, our result is $0.76 per share, including $0.24 in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of 2023, we've realized $0.03 of favorability from operating and maintenance cost reductions, which we have fully redeployed right back into the business. And we're on track for at least our annual 2% nonfuel O&M reduction target. The $0.04 of timing is expected to fully reverse by year-end. And includes the typical tax driver, which results in variances between quarterly and annual earnings. This driver is even more pronounced this year as we await the final decision in our GRC. And the $0.04 of other has not changed from last quarter.\nOnce we receive a final GRC decision, we will record the catch-up revenues supporting our customer capital investments for the full year 2023 as tracked in our approved memo accounts. This incremental catch-up revenue is the largest discrete driver of earnings that we project for the fourth quarter. As you may have seen, we have adjusted our accrual for the 2021 [ Dixie ] fire this quarter. Our focus continues to be on making it right for the victims, and we are making a noncash increase to our accrual of $425 million to reflect our claims settlement experience to date. At the same time, we recorded an offsetting receivable from the state Wildfire Fund, reflecting our continued confidence in the protections provided by AB 1054.\nOn Slide 11, our 10-year capital investment plan has not changed. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to advocate for improvements in the final outcome of our GRC. At the same time, we have several layers of financial protection to support our plan, including opportunities to seek cost recovery for the needed safety and reliability investments that our system requires. Our customers demand and which are legislative and regulatory stakeholder support. You can be sure that we're not taking our foot off the pedal to find and realize opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost.\nReducing costs and delivering more for our customers are core to our simple affordable model shown here on Slide 12. Coupled with load growth and efficient financing, this is how we plan to keep customer bills affordable. In fact, while we expect a step up in average customer bills in 2024 with the GRC implementation, our internal forecast for 2025 and 2026 show a declining bill trajectory. As we progress our lean tools, lower O&M costs and as legacy cost items, including [ LIMS ] recoveries roll off. This permits us to sustain average annual bill increases from 2023 through 2026 at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range, even with the first year GRC step up.\nPart of our affordable model is efficient financing. Our sale of a minority stake in our nonnuclear generating assets, Pacific Generation has received robust inbound interest for this attractive and unique portfolio. The regulatory record closed earlier this month and a PD is due early next year. We are targeting a transaction closing date in mid-2024.\nI'll end here on Slide 13, looking forward to 2024. On October 13, you saw this file an advice letter with the CPUC seeking to implement the cost of capital adjusted adjustment mechanism effective January 1, 2024, subject to commission disposition.\nBased on market interest rates, the mechanism has triggered, resulting in a formulaic 70 basis point upward adjustment to our return on equity and a 35 basis point upward adjustment to our cost of long-term debt. We believe the increase is well justified by market conditions. And if improved, we anticipate reinvesting any upside beyond our targeted earnings growth right back into the system for the benefit of our customers.\nOn the same day, we also filed our TO21 rate case application with FERC seeking a 12.87% ROE, inclusive of the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder. A FERC order, except in the filing is expected by mid-December for rates to be effective January 1, 2024. Our filing includes $1.9 billion in forecasted capital additions during '23 and 2024.\nAs a reminder, a nice feature of our formula rate structure is the annual true-up mechanism, which adjusts rates to reflect actual costs, including customer capital investment, which, as we've said, is an area where we see abundant growth opportunities.\nTo summarize, we are mitigating both our physical and financial risk with layers of protection. Although we are concerned that the PDs and our GRC risk setting us back to -- in our quest to restore our credit ratings. We believe we can make our system safer faster and more affordable for our customers. At the same time, we are offering attractive earnings growth to investors.\nWe are looking forward to reinstating our common dividend soon. and we look forward to catching up with many of you at EEI next month. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I just wanted to take a moment to review our regulatory and legislative time line shown here on Slide 14 and reflect on some of our highlights in 2023, starting with our wildfire self-insurance settlement in January which we see saving customers up to $1.8 billion through this 4-year GRC period. Other milestones include resolving our safety culture OII. Settlements with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division for both the [ Zog ] and the Dixie fires and over $1 billion of interim rate relief approved in our 2022 [ Wenzy ] proceeding.\nWe have plenty to look forward to as well. Key catalysts we can point to include resolving our GRC and achieving base revenue visibility through 2026, approval of our 2023 WMP and safety certificate, resolution of our GRC Phase 2 proposal to implement SB 410. Our 10-year undergrounding plan filing under SB 884, disposition of our cost of capital adjustment advice letter. The proposed decision on Pacific Generation and advancing our DOE loan application.\nThat's a lot of value to come for customers as well as investors. In addition to regulatory catalysts, we look forward to further progress towards normalizing our financial profile. With the Fire Victim trust completing their sales, restoring our credit ratings to investment grade to unlock significant financing cost savings for customers and reinstating our common dividend.\nWe believe these catalysts favorably differentiate the PG&E investment story anchored in our simple affordable model. Our strategy remains focused and is based on the foundational belief that a financially healthy and well-run PG&E can and will play a leading role in enabling the clean, affordable and resilient energy future to which the state of California and our customers aspire. We trust that you feel the momentum that we do. And with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Jonathan Arnold, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management.\nSome of the important factors which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. Presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nWith that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on what we know is a very busy earnings morning. We continue to make progress here at PG&E and this quarter is no different. Our core earnings per share of $0.23 for the second quarter bring us to $0.52 for the first half of 2023. While our first half earnings are down $0.03 versus 2022, we have not yet recognized the benefit of our general rate case. .\nAs a reminder, we have a memo account in place, which will allow us to book catch-up revenues from the January 1, 2023 effective date once we receive a final CPUC decision. We still expect a final decision in the third quarter, and we were encouraged that the CPUC affirmed this timing earlier this month. As we shared at our Investor Day in May, 86% of our incremental revenue request is for core safety, reliability and maintenance work. All areas where there is strong alignment with state policy goals and stakeholder priorities. While the GRC decision will be an important driver, halfway through the year, we remain on track to plan and laser-focused on delivering our annual guidance which we are reaffirming today.\nWe are also reaffirming earnings growth rates of at least 10% in 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026, along with our commitment to no new equity issuance through 2024. Turning to Slide 4. We've continued to make progress in mitigating physical and financial risk. On the physical front, we continue to focus on system resilience by reducing wildfire risk and preparing for the grid of the future. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front as well. For example, in the second quarter, the CPUC approved over $1 billion of interim rate relief in our 2022 Wednesday proceeding.\nThis accelerates the time line for recovering our legacy wildfire mitigation spend, improves our financial metrics and allows us to deliver on needed safety, reliability and customer connections work, benefiting both our customers and our investors. On the legal front, at the end of May, we were pleased to settle with the [ Shasta ] County District Attorney's Office, resolving the criminal charges related to the 2020 Zogg Fire. The settlement includes commitments by PG&E to contribute $45 million to various local organizations as part of our ongoing efforts to make it right and make it safe.\nOur settlement followed rulings by the Superior Court, which upheld our long-standing position that there was no evidence showing PG&E's inspections fell below the required standard of care, nor was there any evidence that the risk related to the tree was visible prior to the fire. The court's ruling from April is available on our Investor Relations website.\nTurning to financial risk mitigation. Our strategy continues to hinge around the simple, affordable model, which delivers consistently improving value for customers and investors. Regarding the Fire Victim Trust, we are encouraged that the trust has now monetized over 85% of its initial holding and at steadily higher values for its beneficiaries. After the [ $60 million ] share sale earlier this month, the trust now holds just over 3% of our stock.\nAs of the end of June, determination notices have been issued for 97% of all claims, with the trustee having indicated a goal to reach 100% and monetize the remaining shares by year-end.\nTurning to Slide 5. We highlight our layers of protection strategy, along with our anticipated step-up in risk reduction from 90% to 94% as we roll out our new and expanded programs under our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. One example is downed conductor detection technology, which involves installing new hardware in the field, supplementing our enhanced power line safety settings. We filed our WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety in late March, and the OEIS came out with its revision notice towards the end of June.\nWe view this feedback as a constructive part of the WMP process, and we embrace the opportunity to drive further alignment with our regulators. OEIS identified 8 critical issues, and we will file our response by August 7 deadline with the draft decision from OEIS expected at the end of September. The revision notice process will not preclude us from filing our annual safety certificate application by the due date of September 13 with OEIS approval due 90 days later.\nAs a reminder, our existing safety certificate remains in effect, pending an OEIS decision on our timely filed new application. Earlier this month, at the Annual Board level safety briefing with the CPUC, our Utility Board Chair, Cheryl Campbell; and our Chief Operating Officer, Sumeet Singh discussed our safety culture, performance and details of our enterprise safety management system. These meetings are an element of our AB 1054 compliance and provide an opportunity to engage with regulators on our improvement strategies.\nWe were encouraged to hear commissioners recognize our significant progress, while acknowledging our challenges, including changing climate conditions. It's in moments like this that we step back and reflect on the progress being made. In fact, at a recent meeting with all of our top leaders, Mark Quinlan, our SVP of Wildfire and Emergency Operations stood up to address the elephant in the room when he said, \"I bet you're all watching the weather and thinking back to 2017. And Well, let me remind you just how much we've done since then.\" He went on to remind us all that we have an entirely different readiness posture and physical risk mitigation regime in place.\nBack in 2017, we were reacting and responding to hazards. The investments we've made since then have enabled a dramatic shift to predicting and preventing. Slide 6 illustrates the mitigations now in place, thanks to these important investments in innovation. To name just a few. Since 2017, we have installed over 600 high-definition cameras now with AI capabilities, more than 1,400 weather stations and almost 1,400 sectionalizing devices.\nWe've hardened over 1,300 miles of line and undergrounded over 300 more. We've removed 3.3 million trees. We've staffed a hazard awareness warning center, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, and we've hired 130 fire prevention professionals who are on our PG&E team and making us safer every day. We've implemented a host of operational mitigations, including enhanced power line safety settings on 44,000 miles of line in and adjacent to our high fire risk areas.\nWe've enabled public safety power shutoffs when conditions warrant them [indiscernible] for 2023, we've deployed partial voltage force out and down conductor detection. Our system has never been safer, and yet, it will be even safer still tomorrow and every day after that. As we shared with the CPUC during the safety briefing, we are making progress, and we have more work to do. Safety permeates through everything we do and the presence of controls, including our layers of protection, leads to manageable and predictable outcomes.\nI'm confident that we and our key partners, including the state, are doing everything we can to cause our stance catastrophic wildfires shall stop. The data tell the story. Through mid-July, reportable ignitions in our high fire threat district have decreased 53% from the equivalent date in 2017. Last year, we saw a 68% reduction in ignitions on EPSS-enabled circuits and a 99% reduction in acres burned. The data so far suggests we are on track to see further improvement in 2023. Our hard work over the past 5 years has dramatically changed our risk exposure and the fundamental safety of our system, and we aren't stopping there.\nMoving to Slide 7. We also see profound changes in financial risk mitigation due to the framework put in place by SB 901 and AB 1054. At our Investor Day, you heard Ann Patterson, Governor [ Newsom's Cabinet ] Secretary talk about how the state Wildfire Fund is working as planned. The AB 1054 construct is designed to give utilities and capital providers the financial assurance they need while deploying the investments required to bring down wildfire risk on the system over time.\nLet me quickly revisit the key features for those looking for a refresher or who may be newer to our story. For wildfire claims exceeding $1 billion in a calendar year, we have access to the state wildfire fund. This provides $21 billion of claim-paying capacity protecting investors from the risk of a liquidity event. Our annual wildfire mitigation plan is a requirement for receiving our annual safety certificate.\nSo long as we have a valid safety certificate, we have access to 2 additional key features of AB 1054. First, the utility's conduct is presumed to have been prudent upfront when it comes to seeking cost recovery at the CPUC, along with the prudency standard modeled on the constructive FERC precedent. Second, in the unlikely event of the utility being found to have acted imprudently, any resulting obligation to reimburse the wildfire fund would be capped at 20% of electric T&D equity rate base on a 3-year rolling basis.\nThis cap is currently around $3 billion for PG&E. This is a much better construct than what was in place prior to SB 901 and AB 1054 and that enables the attraction of the necessary capital to build and operate a safe and climate resilient energy system.\nTurning to Slide 8. Let's review our regulatory and legislative time line. We've made progress on multiple fronts in the first half of the year, including approval of our wildfire self-insurance settlement, the Zogg Fire litigation settlement and 2022 Wednesday WMCE Interim Rate release. Looking forward, we have several catalysts on the horizon, starting with a GRC final decision expected in the current quarter; the ongoing legislative session in Sacramento, where we have seen constructive engagement on energization which you've heard us previously refer to as new customer connections, showing the legislature's commitment to California's clean energy transition and then on our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan and safety certification processes.\nLooking a little further out, at the end of this year, we will file our nuclear operating license extension application for Diablo Canyon with NRC, and we remain ready to submit our 10-year undergrounding plan once the OEIS and the CPUC complete their scoping process.\nOn Slide 9, you have our 2023 report card, where we're showing on track for each of our 2023 and long-term targets. This includes our plan to underground 350 miles in 2023, double last year's target and our 2024 FFO to debt target of mid-teens. As you can see, we're also projecting on track for our 2% nonfuel O&M reduction target, which brings me to my story of the month. This month's story illustrates how our regional service model, together with our performance playbook and lean operating system is helping improve the customer experience while we eliminate waste and cost in our work processes.\nIn the North Coast region, field operations teams are improving upon a common sense approach that has worked in a lot of our programs, bundling work. What's different now is that the teams are working across various branches of electric, gas, systems inspections and vegetation management to coordinate many types of work, not just bundling similar work in siloed programs as we've done in the past. Cross-functional work bundling allows crews to do more work under the same planned outage line clearance, reducing the cost of switching and grid operations and improving overall reliability.\nDuring Q2, my coworkers planned and executed 12 jobs under just one planned outage near the town of Willits. Rather than impacting 100-plus customers multiple times over the year, we did it all in just one go. That's 1 outage, 1 day of traffic lane closures, 1 batch of notifications and only 1 visit. This goes to show you what's possible when we put the customer at the center of our operations. So far this year, we estimate savings of $0.5 million and 800-plus hours when we did not have to deenergize our customers.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg and something we are working actively to scale up across all regions, proving we can deliver an improved customer experience while cutting costs all at the same time. This is all part of the momentum we're building here at PG&E.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everybody. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no new equity in 2023 or 2024. This morning, I'll cover 3 main topics with you: our 2023 results, the simple, affordable model and our value proposition.\nLet's start on Slide 10. We are on track to meet our 2023 EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. Our first half results and drivers of our forecast for the second half of 2023 are presented here. On a year-to-date basis, our result is $0.52 per share, including $0.23 in the second quarter. Our first half EPS is on plan. And as Patti mentioned, our plan to reduce nonfuel O&M by 2% is also on track. So far this year, we've realized [ $0.04 ] of favorability from our cost-saving efforts, and we've redeployed $0.02 right back into the business.\nAlthough our year-to-date result is down $0.03 compared to 2022, a key driver for the second half of 2023 will be a final decision in our GRC. As a reminder, the CPUC has approved a standard memo account, which allows us to record catch-up revenues back to January 1 once the final decision is received. This explains the $0.01 of timing as shown here and also why you don't see customer capital investment as a growth driver in our first half results.\nFinally, we're showing $0.04 of other. This is a combination of many smaller items over the first and second quarters, including higher property taxes, reflecting our increased customer capital investment. On Slide 11, our capital investment plans have not changed from Investor Day when we provided insight into our 10-year plan. Our 9.5% rate-based CAGR reflects the abundant opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers.\nPlease recall, this is a no big bets approach focused on safety and reliability with growth benefiting both our customers and our investors. Just as our earnings grow with capital growth, it's worth repeating that this capital investment growth above depreciation also provides additional cash flow to help internally fund the investment.\nMoving to Slide 12. We continue to see ample opportunities to expand customer investment beyond the $52 billion planned through 2027. We are fortunate to have substantial needs for investment in our electric distribution and transmission systems as well as opportunities to further improve quality and reduce cost.\nOur simple, affordable model is at the heart of our plan. It is how we plan to keep bills affordable for our customers, which takes us to Slide 13. As you've seen, we revisit this slide with you each quarter providing proof points on our execution. Patti already provided an update on our O&M cost reduction progress. And now I'm excited to share some recent efficient financing developments. Our minority sale of nonnuclear generating assets or Pacific Gen continues to move through the regulatory process.\nWe launched the marketing for the proposed sale last month. We expect these attractive and differentiated assets to draw strong investor interest as they are fully regulated with a favorable ratemaking framework. And with California's environmental policies in place, we see a very supportive backdrop for growth opportunities. As a reminder, the Pac Gen regulatory and sales processes will progress unparallel time lines.\nAdditionally, last month, we submitted a loan application to the Department of Energy under the Energy Infrastructure reinvestment program. Our application is all about enabling California's clean energy transition. If our application is approved, we would expect to draw down these funds starting in 2024 and through 2026 to align with spending in our GRC cycle. This is another example of how we're pursuing efficient financing to deliver for our customers and our communities at a lower cost.\nIn addition to providing a diversified funding source for our large capital program, lower cost DOE loans could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense savings for our customers over the life of the loans. This means that our planned rate base growth could come at a lower cost for our customers, creating more capacity for investment in customer benefiting infrastructure, definitely a win-win.\nWe plan to submit part 2 of our application in the coming months, in which we will work with the loan program office on the technical and financial evaluation of our application. I'll end here on Slide 14, with a reiteration of dividend timing. Specifically, we expect to reach a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11 during the third quarter.\nAs we have said before, this timing remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of major regulatory decisions. In practice, this means that our Board could have the opportunity to declare a dividend as soon as our third quarter earnings call. We are committed to restoring a dividend and recognize its importance to traditional utility investors.\nBut let me be clear, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start out with a small dividend, likely lower than some published estimates. This will allow us to continue prioritizing needed capital investment, including safety and physical risk reduction on behalf of our customers. While we would expect to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings per share, our initial bias will be towards premium EPS growth versus higher yield, consistent with our capital investment priority.\nOur physical and financial risks are being mitigated. Our capital investment need and growth forecast benefits customers and investors. Our EPS growth is among the very best as our stock price recovers from a deep discount. And our value proposition is strong and improving every quarter. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, I wanted to take a quick moment to highlight 2 other pieces of news from PG&E this week. Yesterday, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report, which outlines major strides we've made towards the triple bottom line of serving people, the planet and California's [indiscernible].\nUsing statistics and stories, the report details meaningful action we took last year in service of our home towns throughout Northern and Central California. Second, as highlighted here on Slide 15, we hosted our inaugural Innovation Summit earlier this week, drawing over 2,000 in-person and virtual participants from venture capital, technology, academic and financial world. Risk mitigation, in particular, wildfire has rightly been Job one and our main priority.\nAt the same time, our California service area is at the very forefront of the energy transition given our state's bold vision for the future. With this in mind, we created our innovation research and development team to capitalize on breakthrough opportunities, drawing on the external innovation ecosystem to inspire bold new ideas for safety and our operations.\nFor example, during the Innovation Summit, we featured a first-of-its-kind version of Schneider's electric distribution energy management system operating on the Microsoft Cloud. On the topic of innovation, I'm also pleased to announce that the X-Prize competition featured at our Investor Day has already received interest from 120 individual teams out of 32 different countries.\nTalk about breakthrough opportunities. The objective of this competition is to be able to pinpoint ignitions from space within 60 seconds or less and autonomously suppress wildfires within 10 minutes. I'm excited to see what these brilliant minds produce. I'll wrap up on Slide 16 by saying we feel good about the progress we are making mitigating physical and financial risk.\nWe're confident in the protections we have in place for this wildfire season. And we see several catalysts ahead for investors, including restoration of our common stock dividend and a final decision in our 2023 GRC. We see the progress and feel the momentum. We hope you do too. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; Chris Foster, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carolyn Burke, our Executive Vice President of Finance, who will step into the CFO role later today. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\nFirst, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results, are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation.\nThe presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which was released earlier today.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by noting that this will be Chris Foster's last earnings call with PG&E. Thank you, Chris, for your commitment and service to our company over the past 11 years.\nSince we announced our CFO transition in March, Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure an orderly transition to Carolyn Burke, who will formally take over as our CFO later today. So thank you, Chris, for your friendship, your leadership and your dedication to serving our customers and investors.\nAnd a formal welcome to Carolyn, who brings a wealth of financial experience to PG&E as we continue on our journey remaking the company as a top-performing regulated utility. You'll all have opportunities to get to know Carolyn at upcoming events, including at our Investor Day in California later this month.\nWe know you have a lot of calls occurring today. And since we've had a strong quarter, and we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks, we'll be crisp and to the point. Let's get started.\nTurning to our results on Slide 3. You'll see we reported first quarter 2023 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.29 per share. This result keeps us on track with our plan for the year. One timing item to consider is our 2023 general rate case. As is common with California GRCs, we have a memo account in place, which will allow for new rates to be implemented retroactive to January 1, meaning that after the final decision is reached, we'd expect to begin recognizing the GRC outcome along with the prior quarter's catch-up.\nThe case schedule calls for a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the third quarter. We continue to communicate with all stakeholders how important it is to have a timely decision in order to have the resources we need to deliver for our customers.\nAlso today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 core EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 10% over 2022. We also reaffirm our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. As we've said before, we'll work to manage the business through ups and downs like weather, regulatory timing, interest rates and inflation, while delivering the safety and reliability investments that our customers need and the consistent financial results our investors expect.\nHere on Slide 4, I'll review some of the highlights and proof points as we continue to make progress on mitigating risk, both physical and financial. On wildfire risk mitigation, we filed our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan at the end of March, which further builds on the layers of protection approach from our 2022 plan. Record winter rains and snowfall have left our hydro assets in a stronger position than they've been in for some years.\nCEMA, our catastrophic event memorandum account is one of the constructive features of the California regulatory model. It enables us to focus on serving customers when they need us the most, while we track and defer for future recovery much of the costs associated with these historic weather events. We recorded several hundred million dollars of repair and restoration work to the CEMA account between December and March.\nMeanwhile, our customer restoration efforts and storm response have been well received in our communities, and our performance benefited from the investments we have made in technology, situational awareness and emergency response coordination. We've also continued to see more constructive policy outcomes, building on last year's passage of legislation supporting our establishment of a 10-year undergrounding plan as well as the state's decision to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.\nHighlights in the first quarter include our wildfire self-insurance plan, which enjoyed unusually strong support from interveners.\nWe were also pleased to receive the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waiver, allowing our 2 Diablo Canyon nuclear units to continue operating beyond their current license expiration date, while the NRC is considering the renewal applications. We expect to file our applications with the NRC by year-end.\nAnd most recently, in the past week, we were encouraged by the proposed decision issued in our 2022 WMCE proceeding. This would grant our full request for $1.1 billion of interim rate relief while allowing for collection over 12 months, also as requested. The PD could be voted out by the CPUC as soon as the June 8 meeting, and we will be advocating for a timely adoption so that customer benefits can be realized. These benefits include millions of dollars in customer financing savings as well as providing cash funding to accelerate investment. This will facilitate us delivering needed safety, reliability and customer connections work.\nI'm also happy to report on continued progress mitigating financial risk. Our simple, affordable model and deployment of waste elimination, the fifth play of our lean operating system, enables improving the customer experience while keeping us on track to deliver our 2% annual O&M savings in spite of weather and inflation.\nAlso, in support of customer affordability, we worked with the state to offset commodity price increases on winter bills with an acceleration of the annual California Climate Credit. Overall, during the winter gas commodity price run-ups, our procurement team was able to save customers over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging.\nTurning to Slide 5. we continue to estimate that our layers of protection have mitigated over 90% of wildfire risk through the combination of inspection, physical hardening, our Enhanced Power Line Safety Settings, Public Safety Power Shutoffs and improved situational awareness and response. While 2022 did not bring the typical high-wind events that would trigger PSPS, we did see an increase of over 30% in high fire risk base given the significant drought conditions. Despite this increased risk, our EPSS program resulted in a reduction of 69% in CPUC reportable admissions, along with 99% fewer acres impacted for EPSS-enabled mines versus the pre-EPSS baseline [ for ] 2018 to 2020 average.\nOur 2023 wildfire mitigation plan builds on these core elements and will also see us deploy additional operational mitigations such as partial voltage detection, which leverages our existing smart meters and our down conductor detection with a plan to install over 1,100 new enabled devices on the system by the end of 2023, translating to over 75% coverage of high fire risk areas. Other programs being expanded for 2023 include our transmission pole clearing, our transmission operational controls, and further measures, including EPS sectionalizing to reduce customer impact. We expect to be sharing more with you on the incremental risk reduction associated with these programs at our Investor Day later in the month.\nSlide 6 is a reminder of our simple, affordable model, which continues to sit at the heart of our customer value proposition. We remain on track to deliver on at least 2% annual non-fuel O&M reduction with our wildfire self-insurance and incremental vegetation management savings, providing line of sight on continuing to offset inflationary pressures this year.\nThat's a good moment to bring up my story in the month, which has to do with revisiting the way we approach our work, and in this case, in our undergrounding program and how we're eliminating waste in our process. Historically, hitting these internal standards had required our underground electric lines to have at least 36 inches of cover. Upon revisiting this approach and reviewing regulations and the practices of other undergrounding utilities, we determined that 36 inches of cover is not required in most places, and there's little evidence that incrementally deeper conduits are meaningfully safer or more reliable than slightly shallower conduits. Therefore, in Q4 of last year, we revised our standard to only require 30 inches of cover, unless, of course, otherwise directed by permitting authority. While these may not seem like much, this 6-inch change in depth reduces the labor hours required to install our underground conduits and reduces the amount of spoils created during our trenching activities by approximately 17%. We're estimating that this change of 6 inches will save at least $25 million in 2023 alone. That's lower cost for our customers for the same ultimate value, getting our electric distribution lines underground and permanently reducing the risk.\nThis is just the beginning of our waste elimination efforts. We're benchmarking with peers and reviewing where it's appropriate to put the conduit 24 inches deep, another 6 inches of potential savings, and we're analyzing the entire undergrounding delivery process through a value stream mapping exercise to identify further opportunities for efficiency, better customer and coworker engagement and even more waste elimination.\nSo many practices in large organizations like ours get memorialized and standardized into waste. Our play and our focus on it will unlock value for customers in large and small ways for decades to come.\nSlide 7 recaps some of the key regulatory and policy catalysts we have in front of us for 2023. The one minor change is for Pacific Generation, where the ALJ recently added about a month to the schedule in response to request for additional time from the interveners. This will likely push the proposed decision from late 2023 into early 2024. And the sooner we get a final decision, the sooner we can bring the expected benefits to our customers.\nWe know there is a lot on the plate at the CPUC at this time. We also know that we want what they want, a safer and more reliable system, which has enabled with timely approval of necessary infrastructure investments. In the meantime, we're improving our processes to make every dollar go further and building the case for the right investments to meet customers' expectations.\nI'll end here on Slide 8, with our report card reflecting on track status for all of our operational and financial targets. I'm pleased to say we're on track to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our investors despite the early challenges from winter storms. We are confident we have built a resilient conservative plan, which is designed to absorb the ups and downs of the business and the markets. As I like to say, we'll ride that roller coaster so you don't have to.\nAnd before I hand this over to Chris and Carolyn, I'll leave you with 2 additional notes on the financial front.\nFirst, we look forward to being eligible to reinstate our common dividend later this year, which we view as a key step in our return to financial health and essential for attracting the capital we need to deliver for our customers. As we announced on the year-end call, we expect to hit the required earnings level in the third quarter.\nSecond, we've been encouraged to see the Fire Victim Trust continuing to monetize their stockholding and at growing values. The trust now owns around 6% of our stock, and as of last week, had distributed over $9 billion to their beneficiaries.\nAnd now I'll hand it over to Chris for some financial highlights.\n\nChris Foster\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, PG&E Corp.\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitment.\nThis morning, I'm pleased to have Carolyn Burke joining me for the financial update. We plan to cover 3 main topics with you. To start, I'll review the drivers of our Q1 2023 financial results and review the key performance factors that we expect to see in the remaining 9 months to deliver our full year 10% EPS growth. Carolyn and I will next provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items. And Carolyn will then close this out with the reiteration of our value proposition.\nLet's start on Slide 9. On this slide, we're showing our results for the quarter and drivers we're forecasting for the next 9 months as we walk to our full year guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. For the first quarter, our results came in at $0.29. Versus first quarter last year, you see $0.02 of benefit from lower operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by $0.01 of redeployment.\nThe lower OEM spend is a result of the storms Patti spoke about earlier. With many of our coworkers activated on storm duty, less planned core work was completed during the first quarter of this year. This allowed us to redeploy funds to operational and enterprise programs. This nimble shift in priorities and execution is made possible by the capabilities we're building here at PG&E, enabled by our lean operating system.\nFinally, you'll see we're calling out $0.02 of other, including some timing items. What you don't see is a meaningful impact directly from the storms. That is because of our long-established CEMA mechanism, which is an important constructive component of California utility regulation.\nAnother driver not reflected explicitly, but to keep in mind, is a benefit from customer capital investment or rate base growth. As you know, a final decision in our 2023 general rate case is expected in the third quarter of this year. Consistent with past cases that Patti described, we will be allowed to record those catch-up revenues for prior quarters once the final decision is received.\nWe're also reaffirming our commitment and consistent focus on executing annual 2% non-fuel O&M reductions. I'll remind you that we're planning conservatively and plan to deliver on target, no more, no less, redeploying any excess back into the business for the benefit of our customers.\nOn Slide 10, our customer capital investments have not changed from year-end. We have tremendous opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers to advance California's ambitious climate goals and support growing customer demand with the adoption of electric vehicles. This growth benefits our customers and our investors while providing additional cash flow from operations. And our simple, affordable model is how we plan to make this manageable for customers.\nMoving to Slide 11. In 2022, we exceeded our non-fuel O&M cost reduction target, taking 3% out of the business despite inflation. We use those savings to serve customers and derisk the 2023 plan, which assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. As I mentioned on the year-end call, we see more opportunities for customers ahead, and the team is just getting started in terms of finding cost savings and eliminating waste.\nLet's move to Slide 12. We believe performance is power. So we intend to continue to deliver on operational commitments serving our customers better and making our systems safer every day. We expect that delivering these results will help us achieve better regulatory and financial outcomes, and California has the regulatory structure in place to help us do just that.\nStarting at the top of the slide, our 2023 cost of capital is final at 10%. This decision covers the 3-year period through 2025, providing certainty for our investors. The cost of capital decision also continues to provide for a trigger mechanism. Should interest rates remain where they are and the mechanism trigger, we would intend to file with the commission for an upward adjustment consistent with the mechanism.\nNext is our pending 2023 general rate case. As a reminder, we've already reached resolution on our wildfire self-insurance settlement, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. Worth noting is that over 85% of our requested revenue requirement increase seeks to mitigate risk in our gas and electric operations and deliver a level of safety that our customers expect and deserve.\nOur Pacific Generation allocation continues to move through the CPUC process. A final decision is now expected in early 2024 based on the schedule update from the ALJ. We are gearing up to launch the marketing on a parallel path, and we expect to do so this quarter.\nI'll next cover our pending wildfire-related cost recovery applications. With our 2020 WMCE costs now in rates, the net unresolved balance at the end of the first quarter is approximately $4.8 billion. We've settled our 2021 WMCE, resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account.\nAs Patti mentioned in the past week, we were pleased to receive a proposed decision recommending that we be granted [ 100% ] of the interim rate relief we had requested in our 2022 WMCE application. This amounts to some $1.1 billion over 12 months. This will be a constructive recognition of the importance of timely cash recovery, a key focus for the company. Not only would this outcome reduce financing costs for customers, it would also result in tangible work being executed sooner than would otherwise have been the case, including in the current year.\nThe recently published schedule calls for a final decision in the overall 2022 WMCE application as soon as Q1 of next year. We're advocating for timely resolution in all of our WMCE cases. Resulting cash flow will allow us to accelerate our progress toward improved balance sheet health, improving FFO to debt and providing resources to enable us to meet customer growth demands on the system faster. It's my pleasure to now hand it over to Carolyn Burke.\n\nCarolyn J. Burke\n\nExecutive Vice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everybody. At the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting some milestones and next steps of the 2 key pieces of state legislation passed last year. In addition to the DOE confirmation that Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, we were also granted a waiver by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue operating the units beyond their current license expiration date, while we work through the full relicensing process.\nAlso during the first quarter, the California Energy Commission in consultation with the CAISO and CPUC issued a need determination, supporting extended operations at Diablo Canyon to provide electric system reliability in the state.\nFinally, in terms of the undergrounding, I'll remind you that the pending 2023 general rate case includes our request through 2026, as does our recently filed 2023 wildfire mitigation plan. We will be prepared to file our 10-year plan later this year, dependent on the guidance from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Once we file, OEIS will have 9 months to review before going to the CPUC, who will also have 9 months for their review.\nNow as many of you know, California is my new home. As shown here on Slide 13, I'm quickly and happily learning that California's regulatory construct makes this a great place to do business. In addition to the protections provided for under Assembly Bill 1054 and the CEMA Tracker Patti and Chris discussed earlier, PG&E also benefits from decoupled rates and a 3-year cost of capital set independently from a 4-year forward-looking rate case. And this is just to name a few.\nOur strong regulatory environment is an advantage that we will never take for granted. As Chris mentioned, performance is power, and we know we must perform. We understand that affordable customer bills help us not only mitigate financial and regulatory risk, but also importantly, help us as we continue to build trust with our customers, our regulators and our policymakers.\nAs the incoming CFO, I intend to continue to build upon the sector-differentiating simple, affordable model that Patti and Chris put in place. The implementation of our lean operating system is helping PG&E improve the customer experience, reduce O&M, enhance capital work plan throughput and quite simply, making PG&E a more enjoyable place to work for and with.\nThis year, as part of engaging our coworkers on a lean method of waste elimination, we've established our waste elimination center. We are already tracking over 200 projects across the enterprise, and we're finding common themes throughout the business. First, there's a whole lot of overprocessing. And second, there's a whole lot of defects requiring rework. That means a whole lot of opportunity. My coworkers are excited about tackling these issues and projects and driving improvements for the benefit of our customers. We're going after big and small opportunities, some simple and some complex.\nTake this simple example of customer mailings. U.S. postage rates are expected to increase about 7% this year. While we have no control over these mailing rates, we do control what we send to our customers. This waste elimination project is looking at what communications we can digitize or eliminate altogether. If we just eliminated 1 mailing per household per year, that's approximately $4 million in saved postage. As you can imagine, we're not stopping with just 1 mailing, and this elimination project saves more than just postage.\nAs Patti mentioned earlier, we're going after large waste elimination projects, too, including in our undergrounding program. The team is excited to show you more examples out in the yard during our Investor Day in May, where we'll demonstrate waste elimination driving real unit cost savings and making permanent risk reduction affordable for our customers.\nI'll end here on Slide 14 by saying that our value proposition is strong, and it's improving every day. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year.\nAs a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to recognize a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, starting from the third quarter of 2020. For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain noncore items as described in our plan of reorganization. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions.\nI'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time.\nI'll leave you with this. We're on track for 2023 EPS growth target of at least 10%, at least 10% in 2024, at least 9% in 2025 and at least 9% in 2026. I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet many of you in person during our upcoming Investor Day in California later this month.\nAnd lastly, I'd like to thank Chris for his generous support and advice during this transition period. I can't say enough about the incredibly strong team he has built here. Thank you, Chris.\n\nChris Foster\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, PG&E Corp.\n\nThanks, Carolyn. I'd like to say it's been my privilege to serve as CFO here at PG&E and my time in prior roles over the last 11.5 years. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished, and we've built very strong 5- and 10-year plans. The emphasis now shifts to sound execution, which I have the utmost confidence this team can achieve. I'm also very confident that I'm handing the baton over to a very talented leader who we have shortly come to know as the perfect choice to take PG&E's finance organization through its next chapter. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti to wrap.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you again, Chris, and welcome, Carol.\nIn closing, we are solidly on track for another year of consistent performance in 2023. We look forward to sharing more details with you on our progress and our confidence in the outlook at our California Investor Day on May 24 and May 25. While we do have a virtual option for the main slide presentation, for those of you wondering whether to make the trip, there will be a lot more for you to see and experience outside of that webcast window. We'll be showcasing some of our key technology, including wildfire risk reduction, EPSS and undergrounding. We also want to give you a better understanding of why we're confident we can execute our plan, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program.\nAt our in-person event, you'll also get to hear directly from key California stakeholders, including policymakers, customers and other critical partners as we continue writing the next chapter of the PG&E story. We really hope to see you here in this great state of California at the end of the month.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Jonathan Arnold. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan P. Arnold\n\nVP of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.\nFirst, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's fourth quarter and full year earnings call presentation.\nThe presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. And the slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was released earlier this morning.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what I know is a busy earnings morning.\nAs you'll see on Slide 3, this morning, we reported full year 2022 core earnings of $1.10 per share, right on guidance. This was my second year with PG&E with results delivered on plan. No more, no less. As I like to say, we sweat the details so you don't have to.\nOur simple, affordable model is designed to maximize work for our customers and deliver on our commitment to you, our investors, each and every year. Our $1.10 EPS for 2022 was up 10% from 2021 as planned. We're also reaffirming our 2023 core EPS guidance range of $1.19 to $1.23, up 10% at the midpoint, along with our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for '25 and '26.\nAlso unchanged is our plan for no new equity through 2024. As you know, our sector-leading EPS growth is supported by robust capital investment and ongoing efficiency gains for the benefit of the 16 million Californians we serve. In fact, in 2022, we invested $9.6 billion of capital into our system for the benefit of our customers.\nOur system has never been safer, and we continue to make it safer every day. I want to thank you, our investors, for your part in making that possible. The simple, affordable model underpins our confidence in reiterating our financial outlook today despite the very real challenges faced by most businesses in today's inflationary and uncertain economic environment.\nTurning to Slide 4. We've made strong progress mitigating physical and financial risk. So here are some high points. On wildfire mitigation, we saw a 99% reduction in acres burned in 2022 relative to the average of the 3 years directly before implementation of Enhanced Powerline Safety Setting.\nAs we reported last quarter, we were able to successfully navigate extreme summer heat conditions. And in January, our system was put to the test again with an unprecedented series of winter storms, which were met with truly historic levels of performance from the PG&E team.\nIn addition to addressing physical risks, 2022 was a big year for our financial risk mitigation. We delivered our earnings guidance as well as non-fuel O&M cost reductions of 3% net of inflation. This was ahead of our 2% plan and was achieved in the face of the most challenging inflationary backdrop many of us have seen in our careers.\nIn our GRC, we added undergrounding while removing vegetation management expense, delivering long-term safety while keeping cost neutral for customers. We closed our $7.5 billion rate-neutral securitization and worked with California policymakers over the summer as they passed constructive legislation supporting our 10-year undergrounding plans and to extend the life of our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. We view both as beneficial to customers and evidence of the greater trust we are building day in and day out with our stakeholders.\nOn the regulatory front, we appreciate the CPUC resolving both the 2022 and 2023 cost of capital proceedings last year. And in terms of customer savings, the Net Energy Metering 3.0 decision was a win for customers. We estimate it removes about $1 billion of cost shift through 2030 relative to NEM 2.0.\nOn Slide 5, we show some highlights on our historic January storm response. I want to emphasize that this story is about more than numbers on a page. This was us delivering for our hometowns, and our coworkers are at their best when put to the test.\nDuring the first 2 weeks of 2023, hit by historic back-to-back to back-to-back atmospheric river storms, our electric team restored over 2.8 million customers through multiple waves of outages, and we had 95% back online within 24 hours during each of those events. January ranked as the top 5 storm in PG&E history and involved the largest contingent of resources we have ever mobilized, including around 7,200 dedicated personnel from 10 states.\nThe strength and speed of our response also resulted in us seeing improved customer satisfaction scores compared to prior storm-related outages. We've also adopted the standardized emergency management system and Internet command system. And with the support from California's Office of Emergency Services, we've been aligning training of our emergency center staff with our first responder public safety partners. When the time came, our team and an army of partners acted with skill and tenacity, protecting and serving each other and our hometown, and we couldn't be prouder of them.\nOn Slide 6, I'll recap our layers of protection against wildfire risk, which start with our core system hardening, vegetation management, inspections and repairs. When conditions warned, we supplement these with our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings and our Public Safety Power Shutoffs.\nWe calculate these layers of protection, including improved situational awareness and coordination with first responders, as delivering over 90% overall wildfire risk reduction. We've already hardened more than 1,200 miles since 2019, and we expect our overall risk reduction to further increase as we pursue our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. In the meantime, we continue to look for innovative new technology solutions such as partial voltage detection and down conductor technology to keep reducing that remaining 10%.\nOn Slide 7, we take a closer look at our 2022 wildfire risk mitigation performance. Historical data show that from 2012 to 2020, that's before we implemented EPSS, 95% of the acres and 100% of the structures burned were related to ignitions at times when conditions were at R3 or higher. While we were fortunate that 2022 didn't bring significant wind events for the year, there were still 31% more R3 or higher days than in 2018 to 2020. Despite this significant increase, we saw a reduction of 99% in the number of acres impacted by utility ignitions in 2022 over the same time period.\nSlide 8 illustrates our simple, affordable model, which includes driving efficiency to make room for customer investment. You've heard us talk a lot about the lean operating system and our 4 basic plays.\nIn 2023, we're rolling out a fifth play, my personal favorite, waste elimination. And we see this as key to continuing to deliver our plans for both customers and investors.\nOur primary constraint is customer affordability, on which we are laser-focused through our newly established bill ownership center led by Carla Peterman. The entire team is looking at the whole customer bill for savings, including energy supply costs, which we know are top of mind.\nWe have a lot of opportunity to eliminate waste, improve our customers' experience, make our system cleaner and more resilient all the while reducing cost. We can do more for less.\nThe examples keep piling up. So I felt I needed to bring back my story of the month. So here we go. This month's story is about work we are doing to improve efficiency in our new business area.\nPresently, our new customer connections take too long from start to finish. As I recently told a group of California builders, we can, and we will do better. In fact, it's another perfect application for our lean operating system, and specifically, waste elimination.\nThe team invited our developers and builders to come in and work with us to redesign our processes and share their pain points. We conducted a design thinking workshop. And through rapid prototyping, we can see the path to taking the cycle time down dramatically, improving our ability to both do the hook up on time and in less time. Imagine the rework, the waste, the frustration, the delays we can eliminate.\nOne challenge is that 64% of the new connection requests we receive today end up being canceled for a variety of reasons. We do too much engineering before we are sure it will even be used. This wastes both time and money, and it also is demoralizing for our talented engineers when much of their work never sees the light of day.\nWe can dramatically improve how we show up for our new customers. And by doing that, we can free up more time and resources to reinvest back into the system. This is just one of the areas where we are delivering more for customers with every dollar spent. Now that's what I call enabling California's prosperity.\nTurning to Slide 9. You may recognize this chart, which shows how we executed in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, we faced headwinds early in the year. Our recovery work then put us ahead of plan. This is all part of the playbook we're running now at PG&E.\nWe plan conservatively, and we remain nimble, protecting investors from the downside. And when there's upside, we will redeploy it for the benefit of customers, which, in many cases, means pulling work forward and protecting future years. Consistency is the name of the game.\nYou can see it play out again in 2022. We faced headwinds, including a possible cost of capital reset. We have planned conservatively, though, and we're able to more than offset this and other pressures, allowing us to redeploy again on behalf of our customers and still deliver 10% EPS growth.\nEmploying the simple, affordable model, we plan to consistently manage the work and deliver our earnings targets, no more and no less. And when we can, we will redeploy favorability in the business on behalf of customers and look to derisk future years with a view to delivering our consistent growth trajectory.\nLots of people say to me, \"Patti, what if this happens or what if that happens?\" This is what we manage at PG&E. Come what may, we have the capability to be nimble and adapt to those challenging and changing conditions. It's a capability that can be taught and learned. As I've said many times, we ride the roller coaster so you don't have to. You can expect to see more of this in 2023 and beyond.\nMoving to Slide 10. You can see the progress we made in 2022 as we continue on our journey to build trust with policymakers while creating the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of customers.\nAlready, in 2023, we're pleased with the expedited resolution of our self-insurance settlement reached as part of our General Rate Case. This innovative approach enjoys intervenous support and most importantly, can result in up to $1.8 billion of savings for customers over the 4-year GRC period with as much as $300 million expected in 2023.\nWe also have a number of important catalysts on the horizon. Each of the 4 items you'll see here in blue contain important benefits for our customers and for California. We'll continue to work every day toward timely and constructive outcomes, but we don't do big bets here at PG&E. And I want to remind you that we continue to plan conservatively even as I look forward to seeing more green check marks on this slide.\nTurning to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our 2022 report card. While the material fire did not result in any serious injuries and the estimated liability is well within our available insurance, it did cause us to miss our goal of 0 CPUC reportable admissions of 100 acres or more.\nWe put 180 miles of lines underground last year, exceeding our 175-mile target. And we chose to redirect capital investment to maximize risk reduction during the year, which changed our plans for gas main replacements.\nWe exceeded our 2% annual O&M cost reduction, offsetting inflation and delivering net savings of 3%. Yes, that is net of inflationary pressure. We see plenty of potential to continue 2% net O&M reduction for many years ahead by working smarter and maximizing value for our customers and investors.\nCore EPS came in right on plan at 10%, while we delivered 6% rate base growth in what was the final year of our GRC cycle. Lastly, we were pleased that Moody's recognized our significant progress on mitigating risk and improving relationships in the state when they revised our credit outlook to positive earlier this month.\nOn Slide 12, we introduced our 2023 report card. One key change is to our headline wildfire metric, where we're sticking with a target of 0 and resulting a new OEIS metric for catastrophic wildfires. This measure lines up with our future wildfire mitigation plans, and we think it's a better one for capturing events that are of real significance from both a customer and investor perspective.\nWe remain committed to our 10,000-mile undergrounding goal and to achieving our unit cost targets. We'll be filing our 10-year plan later this year with more details.\nOur 2% O&M reduction plan shouldn't be a surprise either, and there are no changes to any of our previous financial targets through 2026. We're excited to be adding another year, 2027, to our rate base and CapEx as we look to give you more visibility into our long-term plan.\nOur headline 5-year rate base CAGR of 9.5% remains the same, but it's now based off 2022 actuals and runs through 2027. We're feeling really good about what we accomplished in 2022, and we look forward to delivering for you again in 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items in more detail.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we delivered our financial commitments this year, landing at $1.10 in EPS for the full year 2022 and completed the year without issuing equity. We're also reaffirming our 2023 to 2026 earnings growth guidance and our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024.\nThis morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap the drivers of our 2022 financial results and review our 2023 guidance drivers. I'll now provide some updates on how we're delivering against our simple, affordable model. Lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items.\nLet's start on Slide 13. As you can see in our full year walk, non-GAAP core earnings were $1.10 per diluted share for the year. We earned $0.07 from our customer capital investments and achieved $0.08 in savings from cost reductions. This allowed us to navigate the ups and downs during the year and deploy resources in our system for customers by pulling forward some work in future years and making other sound financial decisions to deliver right on target for the year.\nOn Slide 14, as we showed you last quarter, we have planned for substantial customer investment in our 5-year plan, about 1/3 higher than the prior 5 years. We rolled this forward to include 2027. And as shown in orange, we're planning to spend almost 1/2 of our capital in the next 5 years on risk reduction across the enterprise.\nThis includes system hardening, pipeline replacement and other work critical to reducing risk. We use a risk-based approach to prioritize our capital spend, addressing the highest risk and customer-centric work first.\nWe are also focused on improving our capital to expense ratio over time. When we were able to do permanent repairs instead of temporary fixes, we improve that ratio and create headroom in the customer bill. This important work in our system also drives earnings per share growth and improves our cash flow from operations.\nAnd as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we've identified over $5 billion of incremental investment opportunity not yet in the plan. We would intend to bring some of this customer-focused spending into the plan as we work to create headroom on the customer bill.\nAnd using our simple, affordable model, we can deliver more risk reduction for every customer dollar spent because of our focus on lean, including waste elimination. Given the substantial capital opportunities in our plan, our pending 2023 General Rate Case and our focus on a return to investment-grade ratings, we intend to continue to show progress on our FFO to debt metric as you've seen on our report card slide. We landed at about 12.5% in 2022, showed some good progress there over where we ended 2021 at 10.9%.\nMoving to Slide 15. 2022 came with own set of challenges that we overcame. We saw inflation, rising interest rates, extreme heat, targeted supply chain shortages, natural gas price spikes, an unprecedented range. And yet, we found ways to stay on plan. And as Patti mentioned, the work of the teams to respond to the historic storms late last year and early this year was incredible.\nThat's why we're so proud of what we are delivering for customers and for you, our investors, using our simple, affordable model. We are laser-focused on affordability and know you are, too. So let's dig a little further into the model.\nThrough a series of good business decisions and the lean capabilities we're building, we were able to exceed our targeted 2% non-fuel O&M reduction in 2022, delivering a 3% reduction despite inflation. And we use those savings to serve customers and derisk 2023.\nWe saw significant savings for customers in vegetation management driven by improvements in unit costs due to a few strategic changes. First, we implemented a new accountability model and a consistent pricing structure that supports the integration of work while improving contractor oversight and warranties for rework.\nThen we also reduced our contractor counts from 24 to 14, implemented new subcontracting controls and regionalized work to build a stable and predictable plan. This should result in a better customer experience. There were repeat visits and lower cost to deliver for our hometowns while still meeting all our commitments.\nThrough these efforts, we've saved around $200 million in vegetation management costs in 2022 relative to budget. And we expect to realize over $300 million in cost savings this year while still delivering the units in the base work plan with improved safety and quality.\nAlso in 2022, we achieved an undergrounding average unit cost per mile, well below the $3.75 million target shared at Investor Day and the baseline of over $4 million from just a few years ago. And there's more opportunity for customers ahead.\nAs you saw in our report card, our 2% non-fuel O&M savings remains our annual target. We're just getting started finding cost savings for our customers, whether it be through improving our capital to expense ratio, eliminating waste from our processes or working with stakeholders to find better solutions for customers such as our self-insurance settlement.\nAnd as you can see in the 2023 plan column, we are continuing to aggressively pursue efficiencies to deliver our annual 2% non-fuel O&M reduction, which similar to 2022 assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. While our 2% O&M reduction target excludes fuel, I want to take a moment to reflect on the higher bills our customers have been experiencing this winter compared to last winter, largely as a result of higher natural gas prices experienced across the West Coast.\nCollectively, during the gas price run-ups in the winter, our procurement team was able to save customers well over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures, including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. To further support our customers, we've been going after bill relief strategies in partnership with federal and state regulators and policymakers.\nOne example would be supporting the accelerated timing of the annual climate credit, which should put over $90 back in the pockets of our average combination electric and gas customer.\nLet's move to the top of Slide 16. As you saw through 2022, we're getting better regulatory and financial outcomes because we're delivering on our operational commitments and serving our customers better every day. Performance is power, and we own our performance.\nOur 2022 cost of capital was decided by the CPUC in Q4, leaving our 2022 ROE unchanged. We also received a final decision in our 2023 cost of capital as scheduled, providing further certainty as the 10% ROE approved applies through 2025.\nLast month, as requested, the CPUC approved our self-insurance settlement. We appreciate this decision as it allows us to avoid procuring costly wildlife insurance from the commercial insurance markets over at least the next 3 years, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. We also filed a Track 2 settlement in the GRC, which should help streamline the case procedurally with the schedule calling for a final decision in the third quarter.\nOur Pacific Generation application is moving through the CPUC process with a schedule that was released calling for a proposed decision no later than the end of November. While this could mean we don't get a final decision until 2024, we don't see the schedule set forth in the scoping memo, resulting in a meaningful change to our financial plan. We continue to view the sale as an opportunity to efficiently raise needed equity and a solution that benefit customers through realized tax benefits, which accelerate contributions to the customer credit trust.\nMoving to wildfire-related cost recovery. In 2022, we were authorized to collect $2.3 billion. The net unresolved balance is now approximately $4.7 billion, and I'm pleased to report additional progress on several cost recovery proceedings.\nFirst, our 2020 WMCE is now final, with those costs moving into rates. Second, we settled our 2021 WMCE resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account. Additionally, we filed our 2022 WMCE application and a motion requesting interim rate relief.\nFinally, on this slide, we are progressing through the next steps of 2 key pieces of legislation passed in 2022. In November, the Department of Energy confirmed Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program and conditionally awarded a total of $1.1 billion.\nWe view the NRC staff decision last month to require a new application as procedural. And I note that our team has been working on a parallel approach from the outset. NRC staff expect to respond in March to our waiver request, which will allow for continued operation of the units beyond the current operating license expiration date. We're planning to file our new applications with the NRC before the end of this year.\nLastly, 2 notes on our progress on resolving legacy legal claims. First, this week, we filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement reached with the SED resolving their investigation into the Zogg fire. We continue to assert, we were a prudent operator, and we've agreed to forgo cost recovery on $140 million, which will be invested over 3 to 5 years primarily in future system enhancements with a $10 million penalty going to the state general fund.\nSecond, we've made some modest increases to our wildfire loss accruals for third-party claims this quarter, including $75 million for the Kincade fire, $25 million for the Zogg fire and $25 million for the Dixie fire. I'll remind you that our accrual for the Zogg fire is well within our available insurance. And we continue to book offsetting receivables for the accrual associated with the Dixie fire.\nFor the Dixie fire, we've reached agreements to settle claims, including with the cities and counties. And we continue to work to fairly resolve individual claims through our fast claims process and mediation.\nIn all of these cases, we remain committed to continuing to make it right for the communities and customers we serve. California has established legislative and regulatory processes to allow for constructive outcomes where we perform well. We recognize that we have a busy regulatory agenda with the CPUC, and we appreciate the commission's thoughtful consideration as we work relentlessly to achieve our safety and reliability goals as well as advancing California's climate leadership.\nHere on Slide 17, I want to take a moment to remind you that we have relatively limited sensitivity to some key variables outside of our control. Part of this is due to constructive California regulation, including decoupling for both gas and electric.\nFour elements provide for formulaic commodity recovery with timely cash collection, a 4-year General Rate Case cycle and a 3-year cost of capital cycle. Additionally, we're taking the initiative through our simple, affordable model and our focus on the bill, which we expect to further mitigate financial and regulatory risk as we continue to build trust with our customers, regulators and policymakers.\nMoving to Slide 18. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to report a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, so starting from the third quarter of 2020.\nFor this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items specified in our plan of reorganization. And as we step into 2023, we still expect to reach eligibility around midyear. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. Regarding our eventual policy, I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time.\nI'll wrap here by emphasizing that we met our 10% EPS growth target in 2022, no more and no less. And going forward, we continue to reiterate at least 10, 10, 9, 9.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. Let me close by emphasizing we've made a lot of progress in 2022. And yet, we are long away from being done. We have plenty more for you to look forward to in 2023 and beyond as we continue to write the next chapter in the PG&E story.\nFor our current investors and for those of you still taking a look, we hope you'll consider joining us in California for our 2023 Investor Day on May 24 in the Bay Area followed by undergrounding site visits in and around Napa County on May 25. We're excited to share more details of our longer-term financial plan and our investment opportunities.\nWe'll roll up our sleeves to show some of our risk reduction tools and technology with you. And we'll also give you the chance to hear about our progress from some of our key California stakeholders. We can't wait to see you.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

We encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand it to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.\nAs you can see on Slide 3, we are on track to deliver our commitments to you. We've narrowed our non-GAAP core EPS range for 2022 to $1.09 to $1.11 per share. As Chris will discuss, we performed well in the third quarter, providing room to reinvest for our customers in the fourth quarter and deliver at the midpoint of our non-GAAP core EPS guidance. No more, no less.\nIn addition, we're initiating 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance. You probably won't be surprised, 2023 is in line with our projected 10% growth in a band of $1.19 to $1.23. We're also reiterating our at least 10% EPS growth for 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. No change there.\nAs you know, to fund growing important capital investment for our customers, we've been working on more efficient financing plans like the minority interest sale, Pacific Generation. We've been working on plans like this for some time within our 5-year planning process.\nAs a result, we're happy to report that we forecast no equity issuance for the remainder of this year, nor in 2023 nor in 2024. There will undoubtedly be ups and downs in that time frame as we continue to resolve legacy legal matters and regulatory investigations and proceedings. We want you to know that we work hard to provide flexibility for the unknowns with an eye toward maximizing the resources available to serve the needs of our customers.\nOur goal is to be proactive, handle the ups and downs so that you don't have to. Our priority will always be to deliver the highest value investments for customers and deliver consistent financial results for you, our investors. Your capital is essential to our ability to make our system safer faster and to deliver for our customers.\nMoving to Slide 4. We continue to be focused on mitigating physical risk and mitigating financial risk. I want to highlight a couple of major accomplishments for the team during the third quarter.\nFirst, we experienced a historic 10-day heat wave starting in late August, with all-time record high temperatures and all-time demand on September 6. PG&E and the people of California rose to the challenge. We avoided rotating power outages, and we restored 97% of impacted customers within 12 hours. This response is a wonderful example of the PG&E team in action, partnering with the state, our fellow utilities, the California ISO and our customers, mitigating physical risk for our hometowns.\nSecond, this quarter, on our vegetation management, our efforts since 2021 are recognized in the CPUC draft resolution recommending us to exit Step 1 of enhanced oversight. You may remember that we entered into this additional regulatory oversight as a result of our evolving vegetation management program and inconsistent risk model application in 2020. Our customers have benefited from the constructive feedback of our regulators, and we thank them for their transparency and engaging oversight.\nAnother highlight of the quarter came as a result of the policymakers of California working hard through the legislative session to enable us to better serve our customers by passing 2 historic legislative packages, one for undergrounding and another to support the extension of our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. As I mentioned, we continue our focus on mitigating financial risk for our customers through our simple, affordable model, and mitigating financial risk for our investors by delivering consistent, predictable results and a stronger balance sheet.\nTurning to Slide 5. We continue to add layers of protection that we estimate have mitigated 90-plus percent of the wildfire risk on our system today. Our layers start with our Wildfire Mitigation Programs, such as system hardening and undergrounding, vegetation management and enhanced inspections and repairs. We leverage Enhanced Power Line Safety Setting Technology and our Public Safety Power Shutoff tools to keep people safe when conditions require it.\nWe extend that protection by engaging with first responders when an ignition does occur to make sure that we are using our collective knowledge and experience to minimize the impact of fire spread. And of course, we continue to evaluate innovative solutions to move above the 90-plus percent wildfire risk reduction with a specific focus on low-energy faults, which are typically not currently mitigated by EPSS.\nTo address these faults, we're using partial voltage [force-out] and downed conductor detection capabilities. We've implemented partial voltage detection through our smart meters across the high fire risk areas and we've had 33 partial voltage force out since the program initiation in June, with 10 potential hazards identified that could have led to potential ignition.\nFor downed conductor detection, we've installed protection on over 5,000 miles of our overhead electric distribution lines in the high fire risk areas, and we've experienced 9 downed conductor detection outages to date, any one of which could have led to a potential ignition. We'll continue to innovate and push to further increase our wildfire mitigation above the estimated 90-plus percent in place today.\nHere on Slide 6, you'll see our systematic approach that enables our 90-plus percent wildfire risk mitigation today. We've implemented our enhanced power line safety settings across 43,000 miles of high fire risk areas and select adjacent areas. With this systematic approach in place in 2022, we've seen a meaningful reduction in both the number of ignitions and size of fires when ignitions do occur.\nWhile ignition count alone is a primary indicator of wildfire risk, not all ignitions are the same in terms of consequence, which is why we've developed this new metric, the Ignition Impact Measure. It's simply the sum of acres burned by CPUC reportable ignitions on primary distribution assets in high fire risk areas. This measure proves to us that EPSS works. Due to our efforts in 2022, despite 36% more R3 risk days in 2022 relative to the 2018 through 2020 average, we've seen a 99% reduction in the ignition impact measure.\nTurning to Slide 7. We're committed to earning trust with policymakers in California, utilizing the simple, affordable model. The legislation on undergrounding and the Diablo Canyon extension fit right into the simple, affordable model, reducing financial risk by delivering safe, reliable, clean energy affordably to our customers.\nThe benefits of the undergrounding and Diablo Canyon extension bills are shown here on Slide 8. For undergrounding, the major benefit versus the prior construct is the longer-term work plan, which leads to real cost savings for customers. The new law allows us to provide certainty to our workforce, create longer-term partnerships for material and equipment and inform our hometowns about when they will benefit from their lines being buried. This long-term certainty is critical to accelerate permanent risk reduction of physical and financial risk for our customers.\nFor the Diablo Canyon power plant extension, the new law is a key step to allow us to provide California with a large source of non-GHG emitting baseload power for another 5 years. The alternative would have been for us and other load-serving entities in California to procure more expensive baseload clean power to replace what is today over 8% of all of California's energy consumed, provided annually by Diablo Canyon.\nReplacing this power has proven challenging given clean energy supply constraints, and we estimate that this law will save customers several hundred million dollars relative to other potential baseload solutions. In addition to clean energy that provides savings to California electric customers, extending Diablo Canyon provides local jobs to over 1,000 PG&E coworkers and is a big boost to local businesses and the Central Coast economy.\nMoving to Slide 9. We are early on our journey with policymakers, earning trust and establishing the stability necessary to attract capital to invest on behalf of our customers. It started in 2019 with the passage of AB 1054. AB 1054 provides a framework to keep California utilities financially healthy while we do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk. Building on the AB 1054 foundation, the 2 pieces of legislation passed in 2022 create the right outcomes for customers, mitigating physical risk and financial risk, further enhancing the California regulatory construct.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we'll file our 10-year undergrounding plan, informed by feedback we receive from our various stakeholders, and we've proposed to finalize our potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation, an example of our continuous effort on efficient financing.\nEarning trust also requires that we fulfill our regulatory requirements and meet our standards. When we identify a shortcoming, we own that outcome, communicate transparently and take appropriate corrective actions. This week, we're doing just that. We filed a self-report with the CPUC for a pole inspection standard gap that was identified by a team of my coworkers. Our standard did not match the CPUC standard. We found it and are on track to remediate all of the highest-risk poles in question by the end of the week.\nI've talked a lot about how we're using Lean here at PG&E. Our performance playbook is empowering our workforce and enabling us to make gaps to standards visible and allowing us to close the gaps, making us a better operator. This is an essential part of the turnaround and culture change here at PG&E. We need to have the will to change and the skills to execute. Our performance playbook enables both.\nClosing on Slide 10, our report card slide. You can see here how we're tracking on our goals for 2022 and beyond. We added the Mosquito fire to our CPUC reportable ignitions greater than or equal to 100 acres. Though the investigation is not complete, we can see that the fire started near the base of our 60 kV steel pool. As Chris will discuss, we booked a liability for the Mosquito fire of $100 million, which is well within our range of insurance.\nWe will miss our gas main miles replacement as we reallocated some funding to other higher-risk capital spend this year. This is a good example of our Lean operating system, making visible the best choices for our customers. We are comfortable making that visible to you too. You may also notice that we increased our annual rate base growth from 9% to 9.5% through 2026.\nOur customers expect us to make the right infrastructure investments, and this investment reflects that. We will continue to do that and manage the affordability with our simple model. The other metrics are all on track, and we feel great about our progress.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Chris, who will discuss our financial and regulatory items.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned, we remain focused on delivering our financial commitments this year, and we are reaffirming the 5-year plan with our 2022 to 2026 earnings growth guidance remaining the same.\nThis morning, I have a few updates to share with you. To start, I'll recap our third quarter financial results. Then I'll walk you through the details of our 2023 guidance. And lastly, I'll provide a few highlights on regulatory and legislative items.\nLet's start on Slide 11. With non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter coming in at $0.29 and at $0.84 for the first 9 months, we're solidly on track to deliver the midpoint of our narrowed 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.10. As Patti mentioned, we took a charge of $100 million for the Mosquito fire this quarter, an estimated impact that is well within our available $940 million wildfire insurance and does not factor into our walk here. We expect applicable self-insurance for this fire to be recoverable in CPUC and FERC [rates].\nEarlier this week, the CPUC issued a proposed administrative enforcement order related to the 2020 Zogg fire. The proposed order recommends a penalty of $155 million. We'll look to work with the CPUC to resolve the issues identified in the proposed order as we have with other CPUC enforcement actions.\nWhile we're showing strong results year-to-date in 2022, some of the benefit is timing related and some of the benefit reflects conservative planning. But because of these efforts, we'll invest back into the system as part of maximizing every available resource for our customers and meet our commitments to you. As Patti referenced, our active efforts during the year have also allowed us to eliminate equity needs for 2022.\nTurning to Slide 12. With 2022 nearly complete, we're initiating 2023 guidance, consistent with our existing 5-year guidance and reflective of our abundant customer safety and reliability capital investment opportunities. Our 2023 non-GAAP core EPS guidance is up 10% from our 2022 midpoint at $1.21, which reflected here within a tight range of $1.19 to $1.23. On the financing front, at the operating company, we expect to issue net long-term debt through 2023, largely in line with our planned CapEx, less depreciation and our improved capital structure.\nAn important part of our financing plan is the sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation filed with the CPUC last month. This proposed transaction would allow customers to retain the benefits of our flexible and clean generation portfolio with no bill impact while providing a source of funding to be invested in the system for their benefit. Our plan to utilize efficient financing from the proposed minority interest sale, along with moderating our parent debt paydown, result in us projecting no equity issuance in 2023 or 2024.\nI want to reinforce that customer affordability remains at the forefront of all our decision-making as we turn to Slide 13. Moderating customer bill growth to at or below inflation is our guidepost. And the simple, affordable model is how we will get there. Our proposed minority interest sale fits squarely into the efficient financing category shown here, with proceeds providing an alternative to equity issuance.\nAs this transaction moves through the regulatory approval process, with a proposed transaction close date in Q4 2023, we are not slowing down our pursuit of additional O&M cost reductions. Our annual 2% nonfuel O&M cost reduction target remains another key aspect of our simple, affordable model, and we're making additional progress on this front in our 2023 general rate case.\nWhich takes us to my last topic, our key regulatory and legislative updates. Starting at the top of Slide 14, we received a proposed decision in an alternate proposed decision in our 2022 Cost of Capital proceeding. Both the proposed decision and the alternate acknowledges an extraordinary event occurred and that no automatic adjustment mechanism should be implemented.\nThe proposed decision calls for a second phase to determine the appropriate ROE for 2022, while the ultimate call for the ROE to remain at 10.25%. In the 2023 Cost of Capital case we expect to see a proposed decision in November, which will allow for a final decision before the end of the year.\nMoving to the 2023 General Rate Case. This month, we filed a settlement agreement that provides for 100% wildfire liability self-insurance. This is a great outcome for customers with the potential for up to $1.8 billion in savings over the 2023 to 2026 GRC period, and here's how it works.\nIf approved, the settlement allows for self-insurance to be funded through CPUC jurisdictional rates starting at $400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years into $1 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. Given the high cost of wildfire insurance, this was a priority for PG&E, TURN and CAL advocates, and we'd like to thank the parties for working collaboratively on a constructive outcome for customers.\nWe're asking for a final decision by February 2023 so we can lock in the self-insurance option for the 2023 policy year. The remainder of the 2023 general rate case continues to move through the process, with the final decision scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.\nMoving down the slide, we will summarize the status on our outstanding recoveries related to Diablo wildfire risk reduction investments. We have approximately $5.7 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $800 million has already been approved for cost recovery through 2023, and we anticipate an additional roughly $1 billion in additional recoveries in 2023 overall.\nThis month, the CPUC issued both a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision on our 2020 wildfire mitigation and catastrophic events application. While we are glad to see the movement in this case, we're disappointed with the proposed decision, both of which declined to adopt our settlement agreement in full, and we will be advocating for improvements.\nAt the bottom of this slide, we highlight 2 important pieces of legislation signed by the governor last month. SB 884 provides support for a 10-year undergrounding plan, which we'll file in 2023. And SB 846 provides for the 5-year extension of Diablo Canyon, which, as Patti discussed, is a great outcome for our customers and our coworkers.\nI'll close on Slide 15 by reiterating that we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, on plan to deliver predictable results and mitigate financial risk. Our 5-year commitment remains unchanged. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. As I wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to take a moment to thank Matt Fallon for his dedicated service to PG&E during a very difficult time. We wish Matt our very best, and I know you do, too.\nBy mitigating physical and financial risk for our customers and investors, we continue on our path toward making PG&E a premium utility, and we've made tremendous progress in 2022. We know we are rebuilding this utility in a way that can last. We are turning the page on our history, focused on the new PG&E story. We trust that you feel the momentum too.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&E Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Fallon\n\nSenior Director of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for PG&E's second quarter earnings call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.\nSome of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described in the second page of today's second quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online, along with other information, at investor.pgecorp.com.\nWe also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. With that, I'll hand it over to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll focus on 3 key areas today. First, our financial results; second, our continued work to build trust with policymakers and play our role as an enabler for California's prosperity; and third, I'll provide an update on our wildfire mitigation progress.\nOur results through the first half keep us on track to deliver our full-year 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We've got the system in place to manage the inevitable pluses and minuses. The system provides confidence that we'll deliver our commitment of at least 10% non-GAAP core EPS growth through 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026.\nAs a result of further progress on legacy items, our rate neutral securitization and good cash management, we are lowering and narrowing our equity guidance. We are projecting a need of $0 to $250 million for the remainder of the year.\nWe're on the right path to mitigate financial risk and deliver the consistent results you can expect from PG&E. We're continuing to build trusting relationships with policymakers and work with them on outcomes that are good for our customers and allow us to deliver the energy they want safely and reliably.\nEarlier this year, Governor Newsom reached out to ask us to evaluate keeping Diablo Canyon open beyond its scheduled retirement in 2024 and 2025 to support the capacity and reliability of the state's electric supply system. We're exploring the possibility of keeping this plant open for California's benefit.\nIt is not an easy option, and it will require much coordination between the state, multiple regulatory bodies and PG&E as well as many others impacted by the outcome of this decision.\nWe, of course, are motivated to be of service to the people of California and our policymakers, and we'll continue to work with the state regarding the future of Diablo Canyon and to ensure reliability.\nI am very thankful to our team at the plant for continuing to remain focused on safe and excellent operations as the conversation and decisions move forward. We're also continuing to work with legislators on Senate Bill 884.\nThe amended language in the undergrounding bill provides a supportive framework for PG&E to follow long-term undergrounding plan, which is good for customers and investors because it allows us to build a more robust plan for labor, the lowest cost contracts and provide the fastest path to eliminating the highest risk and improving reliability at the same time on our power lines.\nI'm pleased with the relationships we're building with these key policymakers in California. We're proud to be recognized as essential to California's safety and clean energy goals. Our ability to continue to demonstrate the turnaround of PG&E enables long-term relationships built on mutual benefit and prosperity.\nJust this week, we filed our final responses in the review of our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We welcome the healthy dialogue with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety, and we believe our responses address their concerns, make our plans stronger and make our communities safer. We look forward to a draft decision on our Wildfire Mitigation Plan by the end of September.\nGiven the dry conditions we've seen in our service area in 2022, I thought I'd spend some time discussing our wildfire mitigation tools described on Slide 5.\nAs a result of the significant work that we've completed since 2019, combined with the protocols we've implemented for our EPSS and PSPS programs, we estimate that we've mitigated more than 90% of the wildfire risk in our service area.\nOur approach to catastrophic wildfire mitigation is driven by multiple layers of protection, starting with vegetation management, enhanced inspection and our longer-term system hardening work, anchored by our undergrounding plans. While we continue to make progress on our longer-term mitigations, we layer in EPSS and PSPS to mitigate risk today.\nOur situational awareness capability, which we've built over the past 3 years, including installation of our high-definition cameras, the use of enhanced technology in our hazard awareness and warning center and the expertise of our safety and infrastructure protection team allow for better coordination and faster response should an ignition occur, providing our final layer of protection.\nThe 90% risk mitigation today is informed by the results we're seeing in operations. For example, on the circuits where we've implemented our EPSS program, we've observed significant reductions in reportable ignitions. And the acres impacted per ignition this year are significantly lower despite very dry conditions.\nWe're continuing to pursue opportunities to improve beyond the 90% risk mitigation with additional innovative technology solutions such as partial voltage [smart meter] alarms and downed conductor capability.\nWe anticipate that additional opportunities, including undergrounding, will provide us with greater long-term protection while reducing the customer impact.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, the Fire Potential Index guides our wildfire mitigation efforts. Most of the damage in recent years have occurred under R3 and higher conditions. In recent years, we've experienced more acres and structures damaged due to fire spread driven by fuels and terrain.\nTo mitigate the fuels and terrain driven risk, in 2022, we've enabled EPSS for all fire potential conditions across all our high fire risk areas, except under conditions of heavy fog, high humidity and precipitation.\nHistorically, nearly all of the acres and structures burned during extreme wind events. For these conditions, categorized as R5 and higher, we rely on our PSPS program. I've talked a lot about mitigating physical risk today. As I know, this is a key area of concern, given the impact of climate change across California and the rest of the world.\nAs you've heard, we have the right system in place to keep our coworkers and our customers safe from physical risk and a mindset that has us continuously improving that system every day. Please be assured that the team and I are also continually focusing on mitigating financial risk.\nWe know our customers are experiencing major inflationary impacts outside of utility bills. And at PG&E, we're planning to keep costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. I'm going to focus on the nonfuel O&M cost reduction line you see here on Slide 7.\nI'm never short on stories and this quarter is no different. Here's a simple example of an opportunity we came across in our inspection work. People often think it will cost more to do high-quality work. I beg to differ.\nLast year, due to multiple verification methodologies between our vegetation management pre-inspectors and our work verification team, we had a 40% rejection rate on tree inspections, resulting in a crew coming back out to correct the miss.\nWe cut that rejection rate by half already this year by adopting a uniform technology-driven inspection process, saving almost $100 million. Better first-time quality is more affordable. One example of many such opportunities. We are just getting started here, and there's a long runway of opportunities across the entire enterprise that the team is learning to uncover.\nOn the financing front, we successfully completed our rate-neutral securitization bond issuance in July, using the proceeds to pay down temporary utility debt to strengthen our balance sheet. Importantly, S&P moved our outlook to Stable after the rate-neutral issuance.\nWe're following through on our commitment to you, our investors, to delever our balance sheet and reduce financing costs for our customers, a real-time demonstration of our simple and affordable model in action.\nFinally, let's turn to our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, delivering consistent outcomes through 2022 and beyond by building on our culture and our capabilities. One metric I want to highlight is our CPUC reportable emissions greater than or equal to 100 acres in high fire-threat areas.\nFires this size are a small percentage of ignitions but account for more than 90% of the acres burned and more than 95% of the structures damaged from 2015 to 2021 in our service area. We have zero CPUC reportable ignitions over 100 acres so far in 2022.\nYou'll recall that in early June, PG&E filed an electric incident report on the old fire, which was 570 acres with no reported serious injuries, fatalities or structural damage.\nWe filed the EIR as required because CAL FIRE collected our equipment, and there was media attention. However, we are not recording this as a CPUC reportable ignition at this time as we are not aware of any damage to our equipment at CAL FIRE's suspected ignition point.\nCAL FIRE is continuing their investigation on the cause of the fire, and we'll review the final report when it's available and the associated recordability accordingly.\nIn addition, last week, the Oak Fire started in Mariposa County. After the time of the reported ignition, we de-energized lines for firefighter safety at the request of CAL FIRE. Based on our review of our data, we are not aware of any information suggesting our facilities were involved in the ignition.\nWe have not filed an EIR, and CAL FIRE continues their investigation into the cause of the fire.\nWe do want to take this opportunity to thank our firefighters in the broader first-responder community for working so hard to keep our communities safe.\nPhysical and financial risk reduction are the building blocks that enable predictable results for customers and investors. I feel good about progress to date. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris to provide a deeper dive into our financial and regulatory items.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Patti. We are on track to deliver our financial commitments this year. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10%, and reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026.\nAs Patti mentioned, I'm pleased to share that we just issued $3.9 billion of our [rate-neutral] securitization bond at a weighted average rate of 5.05%.\nOur transaction completes a critical element of our reorganization financing plan with a total of $7.5 billion of securitization bonds now issued. This contributes to our focus on near-term efficient financing.\nThe recent actions by both S&P and Fitch on our credit ratings reflect increasing confidence in our plans to make the investment in our customers need and affordably finance our system enhancement.\nThis morning, I want to cover 3 key areas where we are laser-focused on mitigating financial risk and delivering predictable outcomes for you, our investors.\nFirst, a recap of our second quarter and first half financial results and a reiteration of our full-year guidance; second, a deeper dive into our results ownership center and how we're using that to execute from a simple and affordable model; and finally, a few highlights an important regulatory and legal matters.\nSlide 9 shows our second quarter and first half results. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.25 and at $0.55 for the first half of the year. We recorded non-GAAP core income of $536 million for the second quarter of 2022. This income keeps us on pace to hit the common stock dividend reinstatement eligibility criteria by mid-2023.\nMoving to Slide 10. Our first-half EPS growth is on target at $0.55, up $0.05 or 10% from last year. You can see our rate base growth of $0.03 per share in the first half and another $0.04 projected for the second half, a clear reflection of our investments in customer priorities.\nPlease also note our favorable cost performance of $0.04 so far and another $0.02 to $0.04 planned for the second half. Combined, this tracks nicely to our roughly $200 million or 2% nonfuel O&M reduction plan.\nBut what you do not see here in our yearly forecast are risks due to pension costs that we manage on behalf of our coworkers.\nDue to our long-standing [section] recovery mechanism approved by the CPUC, we do not see an impact to earnings, even with the current market volatility. There are other changes, including our regulatory agenda as well as tax and other items.\nAnd combined, this shows how we are delivering on our at least 10% EPS growth this year, consistent progress to deliver for our customers and investors. As shown next on Slide 11, we're reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13.\nWe are also narrowing and lowering our equity range for 2022 and are now forecasting $0 to $250 million in equity needs for the year. As we resolve legacy claims, which I'll talk about a bit later, we maintain our confidence that our equity needs will be limited this year.\nLet's move to our simple and affordable model. We adopted this model to help produce medium- and long-term financial risk for both our customers and you, our investors. The model allows us to reduce risk for our customers, holding down bill increases over time.\nAnd we'll deliver on this model by using the lean operating system, which allows us to actively manage variability. It's about evaluating and executing against opportunities like putting lasting fixes instead of temporary repairs in the system, which helps avoid expense in costs that would otherwise flow through right away to our customers.\nOur efforts on this front give us greater confidence in our financial targets for the long term. It starts with [leaning]how my coworkers are using these proven techniques to manage performance, reducing medium- and long-term financial risk.\nTurning to Slide 13. For the past 8 months, we've been maturing our process to bring improved visibility and control to executing our work plans affordably in a room we fondly refer to as the [ROC], short for the results ownership center.\nOn the left-hand side of the slide, you can see the elements of visibility and control. In the ROC , we hold a weekly cross-functional operating review, focused on our plan and performance against our financial targets.\nThis is the same method we've used to consistently deliver on our operational goals for our Wildfire Mitigation Plan over the last year. You've heard Patti say, \"We split the details, so you don't have to.\" The ROC is where that statement comes to life.\nAdditionally, we leveraged the 1-3-10 concept of visual management. Using consistently refreshed data, all attendees can tell within 1 second if our performance is on track; within 3 seconds, which way the metric is trending; and within 10 seconds, the recovery plan for any metric that is not on track.\nManaging all aspects of variability, as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, is how we deliver predictable results. When a key financial metric is off track or trending off track, we identify it almost immediately, using current data, not month old or quarter old data.\nThe conversation always includes who is doing what by when. And the resulting cash back plan will include a combination of short-term containment and long-term countermeasures.\nIn addition to O&M and capital cost performance, our focus in the ROC this year has been on efficiencies in our contracted spending, evaluating productive time, expense to capital optimization that create lasting system enhancements for our customers, and internal staffing levels.\nTake in productive time, for example. In addition to the training rationalization Adam Wright discussed at Investor Day, we've also improved our time reporting this year, based on an idea [surfaced] at the ROC .\nOur coworkers in the field now explicitly report hours lost due to no work or work delays when they are not able to charge to a specific job. Having this data now readily available allows us to problem solve.\nWork delays can occur when a crew cannot access the customer's property, for example. But with good planning, we can enable that crew with a backup job. This simple change to our time reporting has uncovered a huge opportunity to increase productive hours.\nAnd just a 1% improvement translates to approximately 30,000 more productive hours per month. You can imagine we're excited about how this can translate into better outcomes for the hometowns we serve.\nThis example, along with our focus on first-time quality that Patti spoke to, and many others, is how through the ROC , our entire enterprise owns our financial results and not just members of the finance team.\nAgain, visibility and control provide predictable results. Our focus is on delivering that for you, our customers and our investors. Now I'll cover the key regulatory, legislative and legal updates for the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 14, at the top. As I mentioned in opening, we've now issued a full $7.5 billion in rate-neutral securitization bonds. We used those proceeds to pay off $5 billion of utility temporary debt and will pay off the remaining $1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as that debt becomes callable.\nThe remaining proceeds will go towards paying down short-term borrowings at the utility. Completion of this securitization was a key aspect of improving our balance sheet. And as a result, last week, S&P moved us to Stable outlook.\nAnd in June, Fitch Ratings revised their outlook, moving us from Stable to Positive. Keeping with the theme of securitization, as expected, on June 29, the CPUC issued a favorable proposed decision, granting our request to securitize up to approximately $1.4 billion of eligible AB 1054 capital expenditures, previously found [reasonable] in the 2020 GRC.\nWe expect a final vote on this proceeding on August 4, which -- that timing keeps us on plan to proceed with a bond issuance later this year or early 2023. These securitizations are an important aspect of our financing plan, a stronger balance sheet, improved credit ratings and reduced borrowing spreads.\nMoving down the slide. We've made substantial progress resolving legacy securities' legal claims. The net impact we're reflecting this quarter is $145 million. We believe this is a constructive outcome within our forecasted equity needs.\nAdditionally, in connection with the 2019 Kincade Fire and based on the status of discussions with certain subrogation entities and individual claimants, during this quarter, we recorded an incremental charge of $150 million for additional potential losses above available insurance.\nThe movement you're seeing in this bucket of legacy claims demonstrates our commitment to putting these litigation matters in the rearview mirror. And we're making progress on these key legal matters while maintaining our focus on financing.\nAs a reminder, we have now reduced and narrowed our 2022 equity needs range from $100 million to $400 million, down to a range of $0 to $250 million.\nNext on the slide, we summarize the status of our yet-to-be-recovered wildfire-related spend. As you can see, we have approximately $5.2 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $1 billion is approved for cost recovery in 2022 and 2023.\nClearly, we still have more work to do, but just around the quarter in September, we plan to file our next WMCE application. And as a reminder, based on the CPUC schedule, we expect proposed decisions on both our 2020 and 2021 WMCE filings during Q4 this year.\nTogether, these represent the majority of the $2.2 billion shown here as pending a final decision. And finally, at the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting our 2 outstanding cost of capital applications.\nThe CPUC held oral arguments in the 2022 case last Friday, where we had a chance to reiterate our position that the cost of capital components should remain at pre-2022 levels for 2022.\nThis month, the CPUC also issued a scoping [angle] in our 2023 cost of capital application. The commission accepted our request to include an updated cost of debt in September, which we think is constructive, given where rates have moved.\nThe schedule provides for a possible final decision of the CPUC last business meeting of the year on December 15. Before I move from key regulatory cases, just a brief update on the 2023 GRC for which we've requested a test year revenue requirement of $15.34 billion.\nOn July 11, we submitted our rebuttal testimony responding to GRC proceeding stakeholders' comments and recommendations. We continue to defend our request and is the next step for evidentiary hearing, starting on August 15.\nWe expect a final decision in the third quarter of 2023. I'll close by reiterating that we're on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets, using proven tools and techniques to lean to deliver predictable results, mitigating financial risk. Our commitment is worth repeating again. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, we're focused on minimizing physical and financial risk. Our layers of protection start with system inspections, repairs, vegetation management, overhead hardening and our 10,000-mile undergrounding program, which provide long-term sustainable climate-resilient infrastructure.\nIn the near term, additional layers of protection are provided by engineered enhanced power line safety settings when fuel risk is high and our Public Safety Power Shutoff program during high wind events.\nOur coordination with local and statewide agencies and situational awareness and fast response continues to strengthen and reduce our physical risk and provide a final and essential layer of protection. To mitigate financial risk for customers and investors, we will continue to fully deploy our simple and affordable model.\nI'm pleased with the progress as I see our relationships and trust growing with policymakers and stakeholders here in California. PG&E is an essential contributor to California's prosperity.\nWe'll keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we're making the right investments to deliver California's clean energy future. Something really exciting is blossoming here at PG&E. We feel the momentum, and we hope you do too. Operator, please open the line for Q&A."

My name is Cheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pacific Gas & Electric Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nMatt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nMatthew Fallon\n\nSenior Director of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for PG&E's first quarter earnings call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.\nSome of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. The presentation can be found online, along with other information at investor.pgcorp.com. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. With that, I'll hand it over to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm happy to report that we earned $0.30 in non-GAAP core EPS in the first quarter, and we're on track to deliver our 2022 non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. We believe in delivering at least 10% EPS growth for you as investors, this year, next year and the following year and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026, putting any annual surplus performance to work for important customer needs, a win for customers and investors.\nWe're underway on my second year here at PG&E with a world-class purpose-driven team focused every day on the triple bottom line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity. We'll deliver on our triple bottom line by mitigating physical risk and by mitigating financial risk as seen here on Slide 4.\nWe're changing the culture and building new capabilities at PG&E. Our culture is shifting to one of service and performance. We're rebuilding our team's confidence that we will deliver for our hometown. We will serve our planet, and we will lead with love. We've been enabling our leaders to challenge assumptions they have about how and why we do the work that we do. Our culture is an important ingredient in our turnaround here at PG&E. I'm very pleased with the progress that I'm seeing. For our customers and you, our investors, to believe that things have changed here at PG&E, my coworkers have to believe and experience the change themselves. One way to help people experience a new and improved PG&E on the inside is through building the capabilities of our team through our lean operating system. I learned long ago that the customer experience can be improved while we are reducing the cost to deliver.\nIn fact, they often go hand in hand. Improving our work processes takes all of us every day using our visual management tools and our daily, weekly and monthly operating review cadence to manage our performance. We can then identify our gaps and deploy problem solving to address them and set new standards to prevent reoccurrence of the problems. By changing our culture and building our lean capabilities, we're enabling the mitigation of physical risk and financial risk. On wildfire, we're confident that we have the right tools in place to mitigate this risk through EPSS and PSPS as well as making our system safer every day with our extensive inspection program and vegetation management work.\nAnd we're ramping up our ultimate solution, our undergrounding program which is designed to permanently reduce physical risk on our highest risk miles. To mitigate financial risk, we're planning to keep customer costs down even as we invest in our system by utilizing our simple and affordable model. And to further mitigate financial risk, we're also focused on paying down debt and delivering on our 5-year non-GAAP core EPS CAGR of 10%. This premium return is driven by our simple and affordable model being on Slide 5. There are many opportunities for us in 2022 and beyond that allow us to invest in necessary and high-value improvements to our electric and gas energy system while reducing the cost to deliver.\nLet me share an example of the simple affordable model in action. At the end of February, we filed an update to our 2023 general rate case. In the update, we've included the additional $7 billion of capital for our undergrounding plan through 2026 and an offsetting $1 billion in expense, resulting in a similar revenue level to what we filed in our initial application last summer. We have confidence in our ability to execute these efficiencies due to the use of our lean operating system. For example, as a result of the first year of using lean to drive our vegetation management work we achieved a roughly 16% reduction in program unit costs.\nThis is a big deal. We can make our systems safe with the right investments and keep customer bills affordable that benefits both customers and investors. It is not complicated. In addition to mitigating financial risk with our simple and affordable model, we're mitigating physical risks for our customers. As I mentioned, we plan to make enhanced power line safety settings capable on all circuits in our high fire risk areas this year. As a reminder, on the circuits where we enable these settings in 2021, we saw an 80% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions. This is the first time we have seen any material reduction in ignition since we have been tracking them.\nAlso, we'll continue to utilize public safety power shutoffs when we encounter dangerous and extreme weather conditions, building on improvements we made in 2021. When we backcast our power shutoff protocols, our analysis shows that we would have prevented 96% of the structures damaged from 2012 through 2020 from catastrophic wildfires. To inform our PSPS protocols, we use billions of data points including PG&E's 31-year weather climatology study to forecast hourly probability of large and catastrophic fires. In addition, we leveraged hundreds of millions of fire spread simulations each day to help inform our PSPS protocols. Our PSPS algorithms use state-of-the-art machine learning models to increase predictive capability. The technology and data science that underpins our PSPS capabilities is extraordinary.\nWe know shutting off power cannot be a permanent solution; therefore, 2022 is an important and exciting year for us to learn from our experience in the field on undergrounding our lines. There's a lot of support and interest in our undergrounding plans. In fact, both the California State Senate and State Assembly have legislation focused on utility undergrounding this session. Senate Bill 884 and Assembly Bill 2889 were recently passed out of their respective legislative energy and utilities committees. This is good progress. We're optimistic that the legislature will work toward a solid solution that's good for customers and attract the investor capital needed to vary the risk. We actually have a new saying around here, how do you rebuild PG&E? From the underground up. And we are on our way.\nTurning to Slide 7. You and my coworkers have heard me talk about leading with love. Many people wonder what is that? Leading with love. Let me give you an example. At PG&E, my coworkers are responsible for keeping themselves and each other safe on the job. While we improved our DART performance, which is a measurement of injuries on the job in 2020, we knew we could be even safer in 2021. I'd like to say, even after best-ever performance, we are still dissatisfied. We found that by utilizing the simple plays from our clear sky lean playbook, we were able to problem solve and prevent injuries with simple and effective action plans every day. We reduced our DART rate by 25% in 2021 relative to 2020. And as you can see here on Slide 7, we continue to improve this year, which reflects a 75% injury rate reduction since 2019.\nCoworker safety is where a culture change must start. Teaching people how to deliver and enabling them to believe in their own capability that is leading with love. Another example of the culture shift we are causing here involves our permitting team. I will never forget about a year ago at our first undergrounding planning session, we asked our permitting team what would have to be true to bury 10,000 miles of line. Everyone kept saying that permitting would be impossible. Our permits team stood up and declared. We are not going to be the problem, give us a solid long-term plan and we can get the permits. Come to us a day or a couple of weeks before you need the permit and then we have a problem. It is so true. Everything hinges on solid, long-term plans and well-designed workflow. We all know great plans deliver predictable outcomes.\nAs we've started to scale the underground program, we've already seen improvements in our permitting process cycle times, something that will set us up for success as we double the miles every year in the next couple of years. Specifically, we've seen an almost 50% reduction in the time it takes to produce and receive approval for detailed design drawings. Our first major underground project took 13 months to design and receive subsequent approval from local agencies, 13 months. Through a focus on implementing standard repeatable processes inside of PG&E based on agency feedback and by building associated skills, we've reduced the review and approval time there to 5 months. That is real progress. We are making it right and making it safe at PG&E. I can't think of a better way to lead with love than that.\nBefore I hand it over to Chris, I'll end with our report card, which you can see here on Slide 8. We chose these metrics to show you where our focus is, culture and capability delivering consistent, predictable outcomes through 2022 and beyond. One metric I want to highlight is our annual CPUC reportable ignitions in our high fire risk areas. The reason this metric is important is because fires over 100 acres accounted for 97% of the structures damaged in our service area from 2015 to 2021. We have our eyes and our efforts focused on this one. Moving on in the report card, as you can see, as of quarter end, we're on track to hit our annual 2022 targets. Specifically, we're happy to report that we're on track with our miles underground to date target. We buried 41 miles against a plan of 34 year-to-date and are picking up speed.\nNow I'll hand it over to Chris to cover our financial and regulatory items.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Patti. As Patti referenced on the report card slide, we are on track to deliver our 2022 financial commitments. Today, we're reaffirming our 2022 to 2026 earnings per share CAGR of 10% and also reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. This morning, I'll cover 3 areas which tie directly to our focus on mitigating financial risk. First, our positive financial results. Second, how we're putting the simple, affordable model Patti mentioned into practice with a few key examples. And finally, our progress on key regulatory and legal matters. Even with the financial impact from the legal items, our 2022 equity guidance remains the same at $100 million to $400 million.\nSlide 9 shows the results for the first quarter. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.30. We recorded GAAP income of $475 million, including noncore items for the first quarter of 2022. This means we've recorded cumulative positive GAAP earnings of $253 million for the most recent 4 consecutive quarters, which means we have met the eligibility requirements for S&P 500 Index inclusion.\nOn Slide 10, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.23 per share for Q1 2021 versus $0.30 per share for Q1 2022. EPS increased by $0.03 due to cost reductions in the first quarter, $0.02 of benefit were derived from rate base growth and timing of taxes contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter. As we experienced some timing benefit in the quarter, overall results were in line with our expectations, and our first quarter results put us on track to hit our full year 2022 guidance.\nMoving to Slide 11. We're reaffirming our non-GAAP core EPS of $1.07 to $1.13. As you can see here, our 2022 equity guidance remains $100 million to $400 million. As Patti mentioned in late February, we filed updated testimony in our 2023 generate case and our 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. In the update, we included the capital for roughly 1/3 of our undergoing program as well as the additional expense from the expansion of our EPSS program, offset by a reduction in vegetation management and other expense across the business. The impact of the increase in undergrounding miles is included here on Slide 12 and reflected in our approximately 9% rate base CAGR. Next, I'll cover some specific examples of the simple affordable model we've adopted that will help reduce financial risk for customers and you, our investors, for the medium and long term.\nHere on Slide 13, we're providing a purely illustrative view of how our targeted 2% nonfuel O&M reduction can be achieved. For example, we are reducing costs from our suppliers as shown in the indicative $150 million here. We will externally source nearly $11 billion this year to execute our core work. But our focus is on efficient purchasing of materials and support, employing solid industry practices rather than unnecessarily unique standard and stabilizing our requirements with longer-term contracts. We value our supplier partners, and they are an important part of our team and they'll benefit for more certainty to produce more efficient outcomes. We are also reducing O&M costs this year and in the coming years through modifying our work to shift from quick repairs to more permanent improvements. This means moving O&M to customer's experience all at once to capital work with cost recovery over a longer period.\nTo give you a sense of the long-term opportunity, our 2020 CapEx to O&M ratio was roughly $0.90 compared to the industry average closer to $1.40. You can bet that we have our eye on that benchmark. We're already using our leading capabilities to stabilize and improve our work planning to drive meaningful improvement. Examples I just covered are important for us for over the next 10 years, but I want to emphasize that incremental improvements are happening now. This year, we are implementing a new scheduling and dispatch platform and some functionality is already being deployed to frontline supervisors and it's allowing for daily visibility for work assignments.\nSupervisors confirm what work is going out each morning, and what is getting completed by the end of the day. Automated reports will be leveraged to show crew productive time and the related mix of capital versus expense. You've heard us talk about visual management as part of our lean operating system. This is putting it to work to manage a portfolio of over $3 billion a year. Already this year, we've seen quantifiable improvements in our work execution. While our gas maintenance and construction crews have historically performed mostly expense work, they are now averaging approximately 40% in capital. We have a number of smart ways to do our work better, more affordably. You'll hear more about these cost reduction programs at our Investor Day this June.\nBefore moving off this slide, I want to point out that there's also a big cost increase shown here. Costs go up every year. And as we enter a period of high inflation, we're planning on it. The cost savings we're focused on are large enough to offset these increases and deliver a net savings of 2%.\nNow I'll transition to a few key regulatory and legal updates. Earlier, I referenced our equity needs are unchanged. On the debt side, we're focused on meeting our debt paydown commitments. To that end, I'm pleased to share that the final legal steps have been resolved on our rate neutral securitization request, and we are on track.\nWe intend to price a first series in the next few days. As a reminder, we have CPUC authorization to issue a full $7.5 billion program in up to 3 series. The proceeds of these bonds will primarily go towards paying down $6 billion of temporary utility debt. This transaction was designed to improve PG&E's credit metrics, and we look forward to fully executing this important piece of the financial plan. We've also filed an application to issue our second series of AB 1054 authorized wildfire mitigation capital expenditure securitization. We expect a decision in that proceeding later this year. This is an important opportunity to finance critical wildfire risk mitigation work at affordable rates for customers. Along with our deleveraging efforts, our focus on balance sheet health also includes timely recovery of wildfire-related spend.\nTurning to Slide 14. In the first quarter, the CPUC issued a final decision on our 2018 CEMA case, and we anticipate collecting that outstanding balance over a 12-month period for the terms of the settlement agreement. Cost recovery of another approximately $2 billion of previously incurred wildfire-related spend is pending a final decision from the CPUC. We are expecting proposed decisions in both of our outstanding WMCE cases in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of historical wildfire impacts, we continue to make good progress on important legacy legal matters. Earlier this month, we announced that we reached settlement agreements to resolve legal proceedings around the 2019 Kincade Fire and the 2021 Dixie Fire.\nAs a result of these agreements, criminal charges for the Kincade Fire are dismissed and the relevant district attorneys will not pursue criminal charges for the Dixie Fire. While we have long stated, we do not believe these fires were the result of criminal conduct, this is a constructive outcome that enables us to continue to invest in making our systems safer every day. As I mentioned earlier, these settlements have not changed our equity guidance for 2022. Additionally, our previously recorded liabilities for estimated third-party claims for the 2018 Zogg fire, the 2019 Kincade Fire and the 2020 Dixie Fire have not changed during the first quarter. And we are also engaged in settlement efforts to resolve the securities claims that rode through the Chapter 11 process.\nNext, I'll cover a brief update on our cost of capital applications pending at the CPUC. In our outstanding 2022 application, we demonstrated extraordinary events warning a departure from the cost of capital mechanism and argue that the cost of capital components should remain at the pre-2022 level. Separately, on April 20, we filed our 2023 cost of capital application. We are requesting an 11% return on equity. Consistent with the details in our application, we believe this ROE is fair and necessary. We've made the case that this reflects an appropriate return on equity for PG&E which reflects a higher risk premium, driven by our current credit rating and the substantial stock discount we trade at relative to our peers.\nOn the FERC side, in mid-March, we received a decision on our TO 2018 filing, as well as a favorable Ninth Circuit Court decision, providing support for our 50 basis point California-specific adder. We have filed for rehearing on the TO 2018 case. These outcomes only impact prior periods. As a reminder, our FERC-approved current return on equity through 2023 is 10.45%.\nI'll close by reiterating that we're mitigating financial risk by delivering stable financial results. Non-GAAP core EPS growth of at least 10% per year in 2022 to 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're on track to deliver our 2022 financial targets while also running the business with a focus on the long term. We'll continue to make the right investments for our customers, both in terms of risk mitigation and affordability. And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. As we move through 2022, you can see how we are squarely focused on minimizing physical risk and financial risk. System resiliency, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program provides long-term sustainable wildfire risk mitigation. In the near term, we continue with our engineered enhanced power line safety settings where fuel risk is high and our public safety power shutoff program during high wind events. Ultimately, we are investing in a hardened system that is resilient to the effects of climate change. To mitigate financial risk for our customers and our investors, we will continue to make the right investments affordably. We're focused on creating the culture and the capability we need, allowing us to execute on these operational and financial imperatives.\nWe'll keep an eye on the horizon and ensure we're making the right investments to deliver California's safe, reliable, resilient and clean energy future. That's the way we serve customers and you, our investors. On a final note, many of you came to see us last August in California; this June, we're coming to see you. We hope you can join us at our Investor Day on Friday, June 10, in New York City. We look forward to seeing you there.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Matt Fallon, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Fallon\n\nSenior Director of IR, PG&E Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in PG&E's fourth quarter earnings call.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our performance in 2021 confirms my confidence in our future. One, we've got the right team in place who implemented our lean operating system first in wildfire and then across the company. Two, we've established our regional service model to deliver for our hometown.\nThree, we met our major commitments in the 2021 wildfire mitigation plan by the end of the year and implemented programs resulting in a significant reduction in wildfire risk.\nFour, our federal probation period has ended. We're a safer company because of the improvements we've made in the past 5 years. We look forward to continuing to work closely with policymakers, agencies and regulators to rebuild trust through relentless focus on execution. We welcome the transparency and accountability that our customers should expect.\nAnd five, on our financials, we delivered right on our EPS target, $1 a share, the midpoint of our commitment for non-GAAP core earnings on a fully diluted basis. This is $1.08 on our basic share count, consistent with reporting a GAAP loss.\nWe met our commitment to you, our investors, not more, not less, putting every penny to work for our customers. As you'd expect from us, we'll continue to manage the business efficiently to benefit our customers and provide predictable financial results to you, our investors every year.\nFor 2022, our non-GAAP core EPS guidance is $1.07 to $1.13, up 7% to 13%, with a midpoint growth at 10%. Longer term, we're focused on delivering a total return of EPS growth plus dividend yield of at least 10% per year every year.\nThis premium total return is driven by a simple but affordable model that you can see on Slide 4. We're making substantial necessary investments for our customers to improve the safety, resiliency and reliability of our service. including our aggressive undergrounding plan.\nTo mitigate the customer impact of our higher investment growth, we're planning to reduce our nonfuel O&M expense by at least 2% every year. And we're fortunate to have sales growth that accelerates over the years ahead from electric vehicles, building electrification and more. And of course, we're making smart business decisions focused on optimizing our generation sources, efficient financing and minimizing the use of dilutive equity.\nLonger term, we expect the impact to our customers will be at or below inflation.\nEverything we've accomplished in 2021 reflects our focus on the triple bottom line, serving people, the planet and California's prosperity underpinned by our relentless pursuit of improving our performance. We'll continue to lead by that triple bottom line, driving our performance in 2022 and beyond.\nSpeaking of performance, to provide transparency and accountability, we'll be providing you with a report card each quarter. This is something you've been asking for and it is shown here on Slide 5. We'll provide you with specific metrics related to our wildfire efforts, our customers and our financials.\nSpecifically, we'll show the number of reportable ignitions, our progress on undergrounding, gas distribution main replacements, our nonfuel O&M cost reduction and several financial metrics. You'll see our progress across the business as we report out each quarter.\nOur ClearSky playbook works. And in 2021, we experienced how powerful it can be here at PG&E. One bread-and-butter example is an in-line inspection job that I visited a couple of weeks ago. Using our daily operating reviews and visual management tools, the project team installed 14 miles of in-line inspection capability.\nAt the ribbon cutting, 2 local mayors and city council members shared with me how satisfied they were with the work and how we showed up for our hometown.\nSeamless cross-functional execution that is focused on our customers, thanks to our DAS team for making it look easy. And it can be when we have an operating method that delivers consistent and predictable outcomes.\nOur lean playbook also drove the execution of our wildfire mitigation plan, producing great results. Last summer, we reengineered our distribution lines to shut off power within 1/10 of a second when an object strikes the line or a fault occurs. We refer to this as enhanced power line safety settings or EPSS. In 2021, EPSS was enabled on 45% of the lines in our high-fire threat service area based on fuel risk and accessibility.\nTo be clear, EPSS is different from our public safety power shutoff program. which is based on proactively turning off lines and dangerous fire weather conditions, primarily high winds combined with low fuel moisture levels. We're planning on expanding our EPSS program in 2022 to up to 100% of our high-fire threat distribution miles. As a reminder, these settings are in place to address the risk of an ignition on a non-red flag warning day that also has dry conditions.\nThe expansion of the program in 2022 provides a greater level of risk reduction. And we're also implementing enhancements to reduce the impact of EPSS on customers.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, once we implemented our enhanced power line safety settings, we saw an 80% reduction in ignitions on enabled circuits, which translates to a 40% reduction in ignitions across all high-fire threat districts. And as I said, in 2022, we're planning to adjust the program, so all of our high-fire threat distribution miles are capable of enhanced power line safety settings. We've learned a lot from our experience last summer. And we'll use that education to guide how we engineer these settings in 2022.\nIn addition to expanding our EPSS program in 2022, we continue to focus on our most impacted customers in our public safety power shutoff or PSPS program. As a reminder, our modeling shows that the protocols we had in place for the 2021 wildfire season would have reduced the number of impacted structures from 2012 to 2020 by 96%. And due to increased sectionalization and more localized weather forecasting, our 2021 protocols reduced customer impact from PSPS by 78% this year.\nWhile we've developed an effectively scoped PSPS program, we expect this program to be less visible over time due to our focus on our enhanced vegetation management, our inspections, our repairs, our undergrounding and our microgrid work.\nOn that last point, PG&E brought our first remote microgrid online in 2021. This solution means that an overhead line is removed in a high-fire threat area, keeping our customers safe. We're pursuing additional microgrid opportunities as part of our comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan in 2022. When removing a line is infeasible, there are even more exciting tools in our toolkit.\nWhat we're exploring is the full potential of distributed energy resources and bidirectional charging electric vehicles that will offer resilience options for our customers. We can eliminate the trade-off between being safe and having power. That's the future, and we're making it happen here in California.\nFor the longer term, we're expanding our system hardening program. Today, we're providing the first look at the next 5 years of our undergrounding plan, here on Slide 8. It's big and it's bold. We're moving on our commitment to underground 10,000 miles of power lines in our high fire risk areas.\nUndergrounding is a strong long-term solution for PG&E to reduce wildfire risk in certain parts of our service area. As we'll outline in our 2022 welfare mitigation plan, our goal is to substantially increase our underground miles each year, ramping up from 175 miles in 2022 to 1,200 miles in 2026. Of the nearly 600 miles we plan to complete by the end of 2023, our 50% -- over 50% are already scoped, construction ready or under construction.\nWe'll file an update to our 2023 general rate case along with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan on February 25 to reflect this game-changing investment. And here's the good news. Undergrounding is a great example of our simple and affordable model in action. We invest in really high-value capital infrastructure and reduce our spend on temporary repairs and annual recurring expenses. Our update later this month will reflect the minimal impact to customers relative to our previous filings.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, our capital plan is larger from 2022 to 2026 than in previous 5 years. The need for significant investment across the system results from many factors, including continued safety investments in our gas system, property and building consolidation, technology adoptions to make our work more efficient, ongoing grid hardening and expansions and, of course, our undergrounding plan. And as I covered earlier, we will protect our customers from energy bills they cannot afford with a cost discipline that many of you would expect.\nBefore I hand it over to Chris, I'd like to close by reinforcing that we've met our commitments in 2021. We've laid the foundation to continue meeting our commitments in 2022, we significantly reduced wildfire risk and are making investments that serve our triple bottom line of people, planet and California's prosperity.\nNow I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financial and regulatory items.\n\nChristopher A. Foster\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PG&E Corporation\n\nThank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. As Patti mentioned earlier, this is about operating results and financial results. We're hitting our stride on the financial outcomes, creating a solid path to becoming a premium utility. This means meeting our financial targets, delivering consistent regulatory outcomes and keeping an eye on the horizon. For us, that includes an improved emphasis on customer affordability, balance sheet health and enabling clean energy solutions for California.\nToday, I'll cover 3 topics: First, our 2021 results, which were right on target and our 2022 guidance. Second, areas of regulatory and legislative progress. And third, key elements of our strengthened 5-year plan, which balances a range of necessary investment opportunities in our hometown with a focus on affordability.\nLet me now start with our 2020 highlights, then move into greater detail. We met our non-GAAP core EPS guidance, landing at $1 for the year using our fully diluted share count assumed in our guidance or $1.08 using our basic share count consistent with our GAAP loss.\nWe finished the year without issuing equity. We executed our first of three AB1054 securitization transaction. We reached settlement agreements in our 2018 CEMA and 2020 -- cases. And we received a positive final outcome in our first WEMA application.\nSlide 10 shows our results for both the fourth quarter and the year. Let's start with the share count used for Q4 2021 and full year GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share. As you can see, we're in a small gap loss position for 2021 due to our grantor trust election utilized for efficient tax planning.\nAs a result of the GAAP loss, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP core EPS for the full year. Our full year guidance assumes non-GAAP core EPS of $0.95 to $1.05 per share using our fully diluted share count. So on a fully diluted basis, we landed right on our target of $1.\nWe were GAAP positive for the quarter. So our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP core EPS calculation reflects our fully diluted share count. Non-GAAP core earnings for the year came in at $2.1 billion. The noncore items listed here are consistent with the full year 2021 guidance range.\nMoving to Slide 11. This shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $596 million or $0.28 in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the $0.11 of improvement here and, in particular, the $0.02 represented by operating cost enhancements in the fourth quarter. These savings are reflective of our enhanced focus on implementing better long-term solutions, allowing us to reduce costs and resulting in a more sustainable and affordable plan for our customers.\nNow to a few updates on regulatory matters. On the debt side, we completed our initial AB1054 securitization transaction during Q4 2021 for $860 million. You can expect a similar transaction later this year once we work through the next regulatory proceeding.\nOver the next couple of years, we expect to issue total securitization under the AB1054 legislation up to $3.2 billion in the cap that was previously established with the timing of issuances tied to the timing of the qualified spend. We view this as an important component of the capital plan to reduce cost for customers while we invest in wildfire risk mitigation work.\nOur separate rate-neutral securitization has also been approved by the CPUC. As a reminder, the use of proceeds from this transaction will allow us to retire $6 billion of temporary debt at the utility that has funded those payments in the interim. We are still working through the legal challenge that has been filed. But we are focused on issuing the securitization quickly once it is resolved and are hopeful to start issuing a first series as early as the second quarter of 2022.\nAdditionally, during 2021, we continue to make progress on settling our outstanding cost recovery requests for wildfire-related investments. As previously highlighted, we filed a settlement agreement for our 2020 -- case, and we received a final decision on our first WEMA application during 2021.\nAdditionally, on November 4, we filed a settlement with the CPUC for 90% of our request in the 2018 CEMA case. As you can see here on Slide 12, we expect to start seeing cash flows from these settled rate cases starting this year.\nI also want to touch briefly on the next steps in our cost of capital proceeding. On December 24, the CPUC issued a scoping memo in the 2022 cost of capital case, which narrowed the scope to a review for just this year. Specifically, the CPUC will consider whether there are extraordinary events that warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism and whether to lead the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for the year 2022.\nAdditionally, the scoping memo clarifies that this proceeding does not replace our requirement to file a full application for test year 2023, which we'll do in April. The CPUC has not set a date for a final decision. And as we indicated in our application, we believe a reasonable outcome is to continue to currently authorized cost of capital because the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response warrant a departure from the cost of capital mechanism for 2022.\nPatti touched on our 2023 generate case and the updated testimony we will be filing later this month in conjunction with our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan. As a reminder, this is our first GRC in a first on a 4-year cycle and our first GRC to incorporate costs for our gas transmission and storage facilities. The scoping memo calls for hearing this May and a final decision in the second quarter of 2023.\nLet's move to Slide 13 and look ahead to this year and the next 5 years, where we'll continue to focus on the triple bottom line.\nGuidance for 2022 represents consistency, including our focus on limiting equity needs while continuing to make progress to resolve legacy issues. For 2022, we are providing a range for non-GAAP core EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.13. For 2022, we estimate our equity issuance needs in the range of $100 million to $400 million.\nAs Patti touched on, we have substantially updated our 5-year plan. Let's go ahead and move to Slide 14, where we provide our refreshed 2022 to 2026 projections. There is much to share in this improved plan, including earnings per share growth will continue on the 10% path in the near term percent as we grow into our dividend upon reinstatement.\nOur rate base CAGR goes from 8.5% to 9%. This growth includes our current estimates over this period, including the kicking off of our undergrounding program. This plan is consistent with what will be reflected in our upcoming February 25 filings. It also includes investments in remote grids and system modernization to expand our preparedness for electrification.\nWe also retain our commitment to reducing debt at the holding company in the coming years with targeted reductions of $2 billion by the end of 2023. The continued suspension of the common stock dividend will support these debt reductions. The overall financing plan has been developed with our long-term FFO to debt targets in mind as we look to achieve mid- to high teens levels in 2024.\nAs Patti mentioned, we focus sharply on critical customer needs. We can finance this and make it affordable for our customers, and we intend to manage this over time to maintain customer impacts around the level of -- inflation this year. We plan to reduce nonfuel O&M costs by 2% every year. Our O&M costs used to increase every year. And over time, we anticipate load growth due to electrification will help spread our costs over a larger base. And we'll make good business decision to more efficiently finance the enterprise.\nThis enhanced approach for us at PG&E helps us deliver for our hometown and for our investors. We'll execute against this 5-year plan using our lean operating system, where we can better seek out waste elimination and make the work easier for our coworkers. There's a lot of work to do, and it can be done more simply.\nWe've already seen success in 2021. Recall that we targeted savings of roughly $1 billion each year. The outcome for 2021 had us at roughly $1.6 billion in savings. We achieved savings well above that prior target of $1 billion, reflecting good business decisions with improved unit cost performance and transactional savings. The operational savings achieved this year include around $560 million from efficiencies gained by renegotiating electric construction contracts with third parties, among other efforts, and we're just getting started.\nAs a team, we are determined to execute well on both the operational and financial plan. We set out the benefit all components of the triple bottom line and drive prosperity for our state and investors.\nI'll close by reiterating that we've delivered against the financial plan for 2021. Our focus has been and will continue to be on addressing the critical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near term while running the business effectively for the long term. Our stronger 5-year plan puts us on that path. We're investing in needed wildfire mitigation, improving our balance sheet and making the right investments to deliver clean energy safely to our customers.\nWith that, I'll go ahead hand it back to Patti.\n\nPatricia Kessler Poppe\n\nCEO & Director, PG&E Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. And as we've discussed, a lot has happened here at PG&E in 2021 that create the launching pad for 2022. As most of you -- as you know, I like to tell stories, so here we go. I have one more.\nA couple of weeks ago, on one of my field visits, I stopped at our service center. I heard a familiar story from one of our coworkers who lives in Plaster County with a PG&E distribution line on his property. Due to various work processes that should have been coordinated, he's had inspectors on his property 4 times, tree crews on his property 3 times and wood management crews another 3 times. That is 10 visits in a little over a year.\nNow right after I groaned in frustration, I clapped and I say, \"Okay. Team, step outside. Let's go.\" On this job, we could have reduced our cost by 20%, simply by having a better work plan. Similar jobs in 2021 cost PG&E $1 billion. Just think of how much better we can do and how our customers will benefit as we reduce the waste and, therefore, the cost in our processes.\nI feel that momentum and potential every day. That's just one opportunity of many that I've encountered in my time here at PG&E. Opportunities to reduce costs, opportunities to improve our customer relationships, opportunities to deliver as the hometown team.\nWe're excited about what we've accomplished in 2021 and where we're going in 2022 and beyond. We're further mitigating wildfire risk by expanding our enhanced power line safety setting program and launching our undergrounding initiative. We've got the right operating system in place to deliver industry-leading financial growth fueled by the important safety and resiliency driven infrastructure investments funded by our cost savings, our growing load and good management practices to keep customer bills affordable. This is a new era at PG&E without trade-offs.\nWe can serve customers and you, our investors without a compromise. Thank you all for your time, and thank you for supporting the great work being done here at PG&E. Operator, please open the line for questions and answers."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Knell, Senior Vice President, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. .\nThey will comment on our third quarter results for 2025. Following the presentation, they respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today. And can be also accessed on our Investor Relations website.\nThe replay will be available through next quarter's conference call. I'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring the call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning. Before I comment on our third quarter results, I'd like to discuss our strategic review. As you know from today's press release, we provided an update on our comprehensive strategic review. The Board strongly supports the company's strategic direction and believes we should continue to focus on strengthening our leading scientific portfolio within our core markets, divesting underperforming or noncore assets maximizing our financial performance and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment.\nI would like to thank our Board for the progress that it has made on such a thorough and collaborative review process. which has and will continue to evaluate a wide range of value creation options to help ensure the best strategic path forward for the company. As we move forward to support our strategy, we will focus on several strategic actions to help drive long-term shareholder value creation.\nThe first action is continuing to strengthen our portfolio by investing in core growth initiatives, including through M&A, partnerships and internal development efforts. We have built a scientifically differentiated portfolio, which enables us to take advantage of the unique opportunities that are present across the evolving biopharmaceutical landscape. Our focus on science and innovative solutions designed to enhance the efficiency and speed to market of our clients' life-saving therapeutic programs has positioned us extremely well to continue to adapt and lead the industry through advances in drug development such as NAMS or new approach methodologies.\nWe have identified areas of future growth, all of which are well within our core competencies including opportunities across our 3 business segments. Specifically, we will evaluate opportunities to enhance our scientific capabilities in the areas of bioanalysis, in vitro services and NAMs as well as to continue to evaluate our geographic presence. The second action to refine our portfolio addresses our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and maximize our financial performance.\nAs part of our portfolio review over the past several months, we have evaluated the strategic fit and fundamental performance of our global businesses and infrastructure. And as appropriate, will take actions to drive long-term value creation. These actions are expected to result in the sale of certain underperforming or noncore businesses, which will enable us to focus on more profitable growth opportunities. In aggregate, these businesses represent approximately 7% of our estimated 2025 revenue. Once completed, the proposed divestitures are expected to result in non-GAAP earnings accretion and of at least $0.30 per share on an annualized basis.\nThis does not include any benefit from the reinvestment of the transaction proceeds or impact to net interest expense. We will strive to complete any potential divestitures by the middle of 2026. We will also continue to focus on new initiatives to drive greater efficiency in our business and maximize our financial performance. As you know, we have taken extensive action with a goal to protect our operating margin and reinvigorate earnings growth. Over the past few years, we have already implemented restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in approximately $225 million in cumulative annualized cost savings in 2026 and which represents a reduction of more than 5% of our cost structure.\nIn addition to these actions, we are also implementing initiatives designed to drive process improvement and greater operating efficiencies including through procurement synergies and implementation of a global business services model. These additional initiatives are expected to generate incremental net cost savings of approximately $70 million annually which will be fully realized in 2026. We also expect to continue to transform our relationships with our clients through best-in-class technology platforms and access to clinical data becoming an even more efficient partner for them.\nFinally, we remain committed to deploying capital in a disciplined and value-enhancing manner. We will continue to regularly review the optimal balance between strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt repayment and other uses of capital. As part of our capital allocation strategy, the Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization. This replaces the previous stock repurchase authorization for which we had repurchased $450.7 million in common stock since August 2024. We will regularly and carefully evaluate the prudent level of stock repurchases going forward and we'll take into consideration valuation, future growth prospects expected returns and earnings accretion from repurchases as well as our leverage and other uses of cash.\nWith these actions clearly outlined, we are intently focused on executing this plan to enhance the company's long-term value by building upon the core strengths of our unique portfolio, advancing scientific innovation and driving greater efficiency in both our operations and our clients' R&D and manufacturing efforts. Moving on to our quarterly results and demand trends. We are continuing to see clear signs that client demand has stabilized. Many of our global biopharmaceutical clients appear to have progressed through their restructuring efforts and the biotech funding environment showed increasing signs of improvement throughout the third quarter.\nThese are positive signals that the industry may be on a path towards recovery and the improvement we saw in DSA proposal activity during the third quarter strongly supports this view. At the same time, there is still some uncertainty in our end markets. Therefore, we will continue to remain cautious at this time and focused on strong execution to drive further wallet share gains with our clients. The business trends in the third quarter were consistent with those that we described in August.\nWith RMS performance benefiting from the favorable timing of NHP shipments in the quarter. DSA revenue declining sequentially as the first quarter booking strength that contributed to meaningful outperformance in the first half of the year, return to recent historical levels and manufacturing revenue declining primarily due to the completion of work for commercial CDMO clients. Collectively, trends were slightly better than we had expected which led to modest outperformance in the third quarter.\nBefore I provide more details on these trends, let me provide highlights of our third quarter performance and updated outlook for the year. We reported revenue of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2025, a 0.5% decrease year-over-year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 1.6% and as declines in both the DSA and manufacturing segments were partially offset by an increase in the RMS segment. Third quarter revenue slightly outperformed the outlook provided in August. By client segment, Revenue for small and midsized biotech clients declined, reflecting tighter budgets likely driven by the softer biotech funding environment as we exited 2024 and in the first half of this year.\nRevenue for global biopharmaceutical clients remained below last year's level, but that was primarily due to the loss of a large commercial client in the CDMO business who's worked at our [indiscernible] wound down in the second quarter. revenue increase for global biopharmaceutical clients in both the RMS and DSA segments demonstrating that preclinical demand from this client base had bottomed and is beginning to improve. Consistent with the upward trajectory in the DSA booking activity at the beginning of this year.\nRevenue for global academic and government clients increased slightly in the quarter, we have not experienced any meaningful impact from NIH budget uncertainty or the government shutdown to date. The operating margin was 19.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year, also driven by the DSA and Manufacturing segment. This anticipated margin decline primarily reflected lower sales volume in the DSA segment. and lower commercial CDMO revenue in the Manufacturing segment. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating margin will be flat to a 30 basis point decline, unchanged from our prior outlook.\nEarnings per share were $2.43 in the third quarter, a 6.2% decline from the third quarter of last year, but modestly above our prior outlook. The tax rate was the most significant year-over-year headwind as we had anticipated, totaling $0.24 per share in the quarter due to the enactment of new tax legislation. Mike Knell will provide additional details on the nonoperating items shortly.\nWith 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance ranges for the year. We now expect 2025 organic revenue will be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% decrease or the middle of our prior range. We also expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be at the top end of our prior range at $10.10 to $10.30, reflecting a $0.10 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range.\nI will now provide details on the third quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue for the DSA segment was $600.7 million in the third quarter, a 3.1% year-over-year decrease on an organic basis driven by lower revenue for both Discovery and Safety Assessment services. As was the case during the first half of the year, lower sales volume was partially offset by a modest benefit from favorable study mix we can also report that spot pricing remained stable overall.\nAlthough the DSA backlog declined to $1.80 billion at the end of the third quarter, from $1.93 billion at the end of June, DSA demand KPIs were stable in the third quarter. The DSA demand environment remained quite stable from the trends that I described 1 quarter ago, including a third quarter net book-to-bill ratio of 0.82x, which was identical to the level reported in the second quarter.\nThe cancellation rate improved in the third quarter and continued to normalize towards historical levels. Net bookings decreased slightly on a sequential basis to $494 million in the third quarter reflecting lighter booking activity for small and midsized biotech clients during the summer months. However, booking activity from biotech clients has improved since the summer leaving us cautiously optimistic that biotech demand will accelerate over the coming quarters, assuming clients continue to have access to more robust funding for their IND-enabling programs.\nBooking trends for global biopharmaceutical clients remained healthy in the third quarter and were stable on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We were encouraged by these overall booking trends that led to a steady increase in the DSA net book-to-bill in each month since the beginning of the third quarter. We were also pleased to see DSA proposal activity improved in the third quarter, particularly for biotech clients for which proposals increased at a high single-digit rate, both year-over-year and sequentially.\nCollectively, this reinforces our cautious optimism that booking activity for biotech clients will continue to improve. For the year, we expect DSA revenue will decline 2.5% to 3.5% on an organic basis. The focus for us, our clients and many of you in the street begins to shift to 2026. We are closely monitoring the level of bookings that are needed to drive DSA revenue growth next year. It's still too early to provide even a preliminary outlook because we are still fully engaged in the budgeting process. And we'll need to monitor demand activity over the next several quarters.\nBookings at the end of the year and the first quarter of next year will meaningfully influence our growth potential. As will other drivers such as backlog, conversion, change orders, study mix and related factors. That said, we firmly believe that DSA business demand trends are stable. And there are positive signs indicating biopharma demand will rebound, including improved biotech funding and proposal activity in the third quarter as well as more certainty around tariffs and drug pricing in the global biopharmaceutical sector.\nFor the third quarter, the DSA operating margin declined by 200 basis points year-over-year to 25.4%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of lower study volume. We expect the fourth quarter DSA operating margin will face additional pressure from 2 primary factors. First, we expect higher staffing costs due to hiring in part to backfill open positions. And we also expect higher third-party NHP sourcing costs due to the procurement of additional models to support the better-than-expected demand this year.\nRMS revenue was $213.5 million, an increase of 6.5% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter 2024 and essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. The higher RMS growth rate this quarter was driven by the favorable timing of NHP shipments. As we previously noted, NHP shipments were accelerated into the third quarter. And as a result, NHP shipments are expected to be a modest headwind to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect RMS will report flat the slightly positive organic revenue growth as the quarterly fluctuations from NHP shipments largely normalize on an annual basis, and the underlying RMS demand environment remains stable.\nFrom a client perspective, revenue from both our academic and government clients segments increased again in the third quarter, including a slight increase in North America aside from a small $3 million reduction in scope of an NIH aging contract that I referenced last quarter, we have not experienced any meaningful revenue loss related to NIH budgets and the uncertainty in Washington to date. Demand from small and midsized biotech clients have been more challenging this year, having a notable effect on the growth rates for small models, particularly in North America this quarter, as well as cradle site occupancy.\nIn the third quarter, revenue for small research models was essentially flat as revenue increases in Europe and China were offset by North America, where price increases could not fully offset unit volume declines, particularly for biotech clients. Revenue for research model services increased slightly in the third quarter driven principally by the GEMS business.\nInsourcing Solutions revenue was flat because cradle occupancy has remained relatively stable this year. but overall demand from early-stage biotech clients for these services remain constrained due to funding challenges. In the third quarter, the RMS operating margin increased by 400 basis points to 25%. The improvement was primarily due to a favorable mix resulting from higher NHP revenue as well as the benefit of cost savings resulting from our restructuring initiatives.\nWe anticipate that the third quarter RMS operating margin would be robust due to the favorable timing of NHP shipments, and we expect and we continue to expect the fourth quarter RMS operating margin will moderate due to the timing of NHP revenue and normal seasonality in small models business. Revenue for the Manufacturing segment was $190.7 million, a 5.1% decrease on an organic basis from the third quarter of last year, largely driven by lower commercial revenue from CDMO clients.\nThe CDMO business as well as biologics testing are also driving a slightly less favorable outlook for the segment as we now expect manufacturing revenue to be flat to slightly lower on an organic basis this year. compared to our prior outlook of approximately flat. However, the Microbial Solutions business continued to perform very well, reporting high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. As we have discussed throughout the year, our relationship with 1 commercial cell therapy client has ended, and the work for that client wound down during the second quarter.\nThis creates an approximate $20 million revenue headwind for the CDMO business in the second half of the year when compared to the first half. However, we are pleased to report that we are continuing to work with another commercial cell therapy client in our Memphis site. The Biologics Testing business reported lower revenue again in the third quarter, driven by the continued impact of lower sample volumes this year for both biopharma and CDMO clients, particularly several large clients facing project delays or regulatory challenges.\nBooking activity did improve during the third quarter. So we are cautiously optimistic the demand trends in the biologics testing business will stabilize. The Microbial Solutions business generated robust revenue growth and remains on track to grow at a high single-digit rate for the year. We experienced strong demand across our comprehensive manufacturing quality control testing portfolio, including Accugenix microbial identification services led by increased access instrument placements share gains for our Endosafe endotoxin testing platform and higher sales of Celsis microbial detection products.\nClients continue to choose our Endosafe cartridge-based platform for rapid test results and we have been increasingly able to gain share due to the placement of automated systems and technology that drives efficiency in our clients' quality control testing labs. The Manufacturing segment's operating margin decreased by 200 basis points year-over-year to 26.7% in the third quarter due principally to lower commercial revenue from CDMO clients.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to provide an update on our strategy for NAMs or new approach methods. You may have recently read our press release announcing our Scientific Advisory Board former FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Namandjé Bumpus, will lead the Advisory Board whose mission is to provide strategic guidance to our team of internal scientists and business leaders in evolving the company's comprehensive commercial and regulatory strategy to advance names in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe are extremely pleased that Dr. Bumpus has agreed to oversee this important initiative to drive alternative method innovation and adoption. Last quarter, I spoke of some of the in vitro capabilities that we are developing across our DSA sites. Today, I will highlight some of our NAMs capabilities utilized across our portfolio, including next-generation sequencing solutions in our biologics testing business to provide an in vitro approach for pathogen testing as well as genetic characterization of cell lines and drug products produced under GMP conditions.\nAdditionally, our Endosafe Trillium recombinant bacterial endotoxin test is an animal-free product, that reduces reliance on Horocrab-derived LAL for antitoxin testing. We continue to see increased client adoption of Trillium, albeit from a small base after its launch last year. In our DSA business, we are developing an in vitro assessment of human immunogenicity to support clients developing biotherapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies and cell and gene therapies, as well as to gain share in the biosimilars market, for which animal testing is minimal and no longer required.\nBy providing clients with valuable immunogenicity data, we will be able to help offer insights into the potential immune response against the drug. We continue to believe that adoption of more NAMs enabled approaches will be a gradual long-term transition by our clients because of scientific capabilities to fully replace animal models do not exist today. As a leader in drug development and manufacturing support solutions, we have the breadth of scientific capabilities regulatory expertise and access to data that will enable us to be at the forefront of NAMs innovation.\nAnd that makes us the logical partner for biopharmaceutical companies to advance their use of NAMs as alternative technologies over time. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to introduce Mike Knell, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mike Knell been with the company since 2017 as the Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, and has agreed to lead the finance organization through the transition until a new CFO can be named.\nMike is a valuable member of our management team and has worked closely with the CFOs during his tenure. He is a deep knowledge of our business, financial reporting and forecasting processes as well as the finance team. we are working together collaboratively to ensure a seamless transition of the CFO role.\nNow Mike will provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance and updated 2025 guidance.\n\nMichael Gunnar Knell\n\nChief Accounting Officer, Bruker Corp.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. I'm pleased to join today's call as interim Chief Financial Officer. Throughout my 8 years at Charles River, I have gained a great understanding of our global business and have tremendous confidence and our team's ability to execute on the company's strategic and financial priorities. I want to thank Jim and the Board for their support.\nBefore I begin, may I remind you that I will be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring initiatives, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nWe are pleased with our third quarter performance. which included revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share that modestly exceeded the outlook we provided in August. As a result of the third quarter outperformance, we are narrowing our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. We now expect full year reported revenue will decline 0.5% to 1.5% and organic revenue will decline 1.5% to 2.5% or at the middle of our prior ranges.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be in a range of $10.10 to $10.30 or at the upper end of the prior range. The $0.10 guidance improvement at midpoint was largely driven by the third quarter operational outperformance. By segment, our updated revenue outlook for 2025 can found on Slide 29. We have narrowed the organic revenue outlook for the DSA segment to a decline of 2.5% to 3.5% to reflect better-than-expected performance to date.\nYou may recall that we started the year with initial DSA outlook of a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue decline. We have slightly tempered the Manufacturing segment's revenue outlook to flat to a slightly negative organic decline and the RMS outlook is essentially unchanged. The outlook for the operating margin is also unchanged. And as flat to a 30 basis point decline.\nUnallocated corporate costs totaled $58.9 million in the third quarter or 5.9% of revenue compared to 6.6% of revenue in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower health and fringe-related costs. For the full year, we continue to expect unallocated corporate cost will be approximately 5.5% of total revenue unchanged from the prior outlook. I will now provide an update on the nonoperating items.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense was $24 million in the third quarter which represented both a sequential and year-over-year decline. The reductions were primarily the result of shifting debt to lower interest rate geographies. For the full year, we expect total net interest expense will be in a range of $100 million to $105 million, consistent with the prior outlook. At the end of the third quarter, we had outstanding debt of $2.2 billion with approximately 70% at a fixed interest rate. Compared to $2.3 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nIn addition to lowering our interest expense, continued debt repayment resulted in gross and net leverage ratios of 2.1x at the end of the third quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter was 28.3%, representing an increase of 700 basis points year-over-year. As expected, the increase primarily reflected the impact of the one big beautiful Bill Act or OB3, as well as the impact of the enactment of certain global minimum tax provisions.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $178.2 million compared to a record $213.1 million achieved in the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings. However, free cash flow improved sequentially by $8.9 million as a result of continued improvement in working capital. Capex $35.6 million or approximately 3.5% of revenue in the third quarter compared to $38.7 million last year, reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending.\nFor the full year, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $470 million to $500 million, an increase from our prior outlook of $430 million to $470 million due to the robust third quarter cash generation Capex will be approximately $200 million, a decrease from our prior outlook, and at approximately 5% of 2025 revenue that will be well below our peak capital spending in recent years. The improved free cash flow outlook reflects our tightly managed capital spending and disciplined working capital management.\nAs Jim mentioned, the Board refreshed our stock repurchase authorization in October to a new $1 billion all of which is available for future repurchase activity. We will continue to evaluate the optimal balance between strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt repayment and other uses of capital as part of our capital allocation strategy. With our strong free cash flow generation, we will regularly evaluate making additional stock repurchases under this authorization. As part of the strategic review, we will continue to work diligently to maximize our financial performance including through disciplined capital deployment and by actively managing our cost structure.\nA summary of our 2025 financial guidance can be found on Slide 35. With 1 quarter remaining, our fourth quarter outlook is effectively embedded in our full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect reported revenue to be in a range of flat to a low single-digit decline and organic revenue will decline at a low to mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. Looking at the sequential progression from the third quarter, RMS revenue will be lower due to the acceleration of NHP shipments into the third quarter as well as normal fourth quarter seasonality.\nDSA revenue is expected to be stable to modestly below the third quarter level and manufacturing revenue is expected to improve due to the year-end ordering patterns in the Microbial Solutions business. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be flat to 10% below the third quarter level of $2.43, reflecting margin pressure in the DSA segment due in part to higher staffing and NHP sourcing costs. and in the RMS segment due to timing of NHP shipments and normal seasonal trends.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which modestly exceeded our expectations and with the actions that we will undertake as part of the Board's strategic review. The initiatives we are taking to strengthen our portfolio, maximize our financial performance and maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy will further strengthen our market position and lead to long-term shareholder value creation.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the second quarter of 2025. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring the call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning. We reported another solid financial performance in the second quarter, meaningfully exceeding our prior outlook due primarily to favorable DSA results. The DSA business benefited from the strong booking activity that was recorded in the first quarter, and the corresponding lift in first half results is the primary driver leading us to raise our financial guidance for the year. To a lesser extent, favorable movements in foreign exchange also contributed to the outperformance in the second quarter and to our increased outlook for the year.\nWe have continued to see clear signs that the demand environment is stabilizing. Over the past several quarters, global biopharmaceutical demand trends appear to have bottomed, and we believe they are beginning to slowly move upward as more clients have progressed through their restructuring activities and getting back to work. The biotech environment is stable but mixed with smaller biotechs still being more cash constrained due in part to the slowdown in biotech funding, whereas midsized biotechs are performing better as many are able to support their own R&D programs without external funding.\nKey DSA demand trends, coupled with constructive discussions with our biopharmaceutical clients, have also reinforced our belief that the preclinical demand environment is stabilizing. In the second quarter, both gross and net DSA bookings increased at mid-single-digit rates year-over-year, resulting in a solid 6% and 13% increases in first half gross and net bookings, respectively. While this bookings performance reflected an improving demand environment in the first half, the net book-to-bill dipped back below 1x in the second quarter to 0.82x, which we had anticipated and was largely driven by a sequential increase in cancellations and the DSA revenue outperformance.\nWe never expected a straight-line recovery in the net book-to-bill or broader DSA demand trends and, in fact, have often said that the sustained improvement in our businesses will not be linear. However, we are pleased that the net book-to-bill trends over the past 18 months have reflected a steady upward trajectory, starting with a net book-to-bill of 0.80x in the first half of 2024 to 0.85x in the second half and most recently improved to 0.93x in the first half of this year. The DSA business and our overall non-GAAP financial results continue to significantly outperform our expectations, and we are making gradual progress towards achieving a return to organic revenue growth. We recognize that some uncertainty persists across the broader health care landscape. And as a result, we continue to take a measured and prudent approach to our outlook. While we have not factored in further demand improvements this year, it is encouraging that the overall demand environment shows signs of stabilization.\nTo date, we have not observed any meaningful impact on client spending patterns stemming from tariffs or drug pricing concerns. Additionally, the effects of covering at the NIH have been minimal, which I will address further in the context of RMS results.\nBefore I provide more details on these trends, let me provide highlights of our second quarter performance and updated outlook for the year. We reported revenue of $1.03 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a 0.6% increase over last year with nearly half of the revenue outperformance driven by foreign exchange. On an organic basis, revenue declined 0.5% driven by a low single-digit decline in the DSA segment, partially offset by low single-digit revenue increases in the RMS and Manufacturing segments.\nBy client segment revenue for small and midsized biotech clients improved slightly for a third consecutive quarter. Revenue for global biopharmaceutical clients remained below last year's level but did improve sequentially from the first quarter. Revenue for global academic and government clients increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. The operating margin was 22.1%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year, with margin improvement across all 3 segments primarily reflecting the benefit of cost savings from our previous restructuring actions and operating leverage from better-than-expected first half sales volume.\nYou may recall that we are on pace to generate a run rate of over $175 million in cost savings this year. In addition, the CDMO business benefited from revenue and payments from commercial clients, most of which will not repeat in the second half of this year, as we previously disclosed.\nEarnings per share were $3.12 in the second quarter, an increase of 11.4% from the second quarter of last year.\nOperating margin improvement was the primary driver of this robust earnings growth. Most of the earnings outperformance versus our prior outlook was operationally driven with an additional $0.12 benefit from a lower-than-expected tax rate. Flavia will provide more details on the tax rate shortly, including the second half tax headwind from the new U.S. legislation. We are raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, largely to reflect the outperformance in the quarter. We are increasing our 2025 organic revenue guidance by 150 basis points to a 1% to 3% decrease and raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.55 at midpoint to $9.90 to $10.30.\nIn addition to the DSA-driven operational outperformance, full year guidance will benefit by $0.14 from more favorable FX rates versus our May outlook. Below the line items will largely offset each other as the second half tax headwind that I just mentioned will be offset by lower interest expense for the year.\nI will now provide details on the second quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue for the DSA segment was $618 million in the second quarter, a 2.4% decrease year-over-year on an organic basis, driven by lower revenue for both Discovery and Safety Assessment services. Lower sale volume was partially offset by favorable mix of higher-priced, longer duration and specialty studies again this quarter. Consistent with our commentary in May, the favorable mix does not signal a broader improvement in the pricing environment as we continue to believe that spot pricing remains stable overall.\nMoving to the DSA demand KPIs. The DSA backlog was $1.93 billion at the end of the second quarter, a slight decline from $1.99 billion last quarter. As I mentioned, gross and net bookings both improved at mid-single-digit rates year-over-year in the second quarter but declined sequentially primarily for global biopharma clients. The sequential decline in the net book-to-bill was not a surprise. We had previously said that global biopharmaceutical clients started the year strong with the resurgence of booking activity for projects that they had delayed or deprioritized at the end of last year and wanted to start quickly.\nHowever, we did not expect the first quarter booking strength to continue through the remainder of the year proposal activity for global biopharmaceutical companies increased at a healthy pace in the second quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially, which reinforces, I believe that demand for this client base has stabilized. Demand KPIs for small and midsized biotech clients remain consistent with the overall trends that we described in the first quarter with little change aside from a moderate decline in proposal activity, supporting our belief that demand for this client base is also stable.\nWe also experienced an increase in DSA cancellations in both client segments to levels consistent with the first half of 2024,but higher than the last 3 quarters. The higher cancellations were more focused on longer term post-IND work. These trends have cumulatively resulted in quarterly net bookings of $506 million and a net book-to-bill of 0.82x. While below 1x for the quarter, our first half net book-to-bill was at its highest level since the end of 2022 and reflects an upward demand trajectory compared to recent years.\nReflecting our solid second quarter performance and the DSA KPIs that underpin our outlook, we now expect DSA organic revenue will decline at a low to mid-single-digit rate in 2025, an improvement from our prior outlook of a mid-single-digit decline. The demand environment continues to support our outlook for the year, which is not predicated on the net book-to-bill returning to 1x. Furthermore, we believe the DSA business has stabilized and is beginning to show signs of gradual progress. In support of our improved demand outlook, we have begun to modestly increase staffing levels in the DSA segment. We are doing so to ensure we can fully support our clients' programs and to position resources appropriately for the second half of this year.\nDue to the increased hiring, DSA headcount costs are expected to create a headwind of approximately $10 million in the second half when compared to first half levels, which is one of the factors contributing to the company's second half operating margin outlook. For the second quarter, the DSA segment reported another solid operating margin, increasing by 30 basis points year-over-year to 27.4% in the second quarter. This was primarily a result of the operating leverage from better-than-expected demand that we accommodated without meaningful headcount increases in the quarter as well as the benefit of prior cost savings actions.\nBefore I provide commentary on the RMS and Manufacturing segments, I would like to provide an update on our NAMs strategy, or new approach methods. We recently updated the Board on our road map and strategic imperatives to continue to build our growing NAMs portfolio. As we said last quarter, we firmly believe that utilizing more NAMs-enabled approaches will be a gradual long-term transition by our clients and that the scientific capabilities to fully replace animal models do not exist today.\nAs the leader in preclinical drug development, we have the scientific capabilities, regulatory expertise and access to data that make us the logical partner for biopharmaceutical companies to advance their use of NAMs and alternative technologies over time. We already have a growing NAMs portfolio that has generated a meaningful amount of revenue or approximately $200 million in annual DSA revenue and increased interest from our clients. In addition to some of the well-established capabilities that we discussed in May, we are also working on enhancing our NAMs solutions across many of our DSA sites. For example, in Montreal, we are working on developing an in vitro liver-on-a-chimp assay to replace in vivo gene tox testing. Our site in Hungary is working on a number of in vitro models for advanced modalities, including using steroids for long-term metabolism studies.\nOur team in Den Bosch continues to develop and validate a growing number of in vitro assays for regulated safety assessment, and our Retrogenix business has generated considerable interest for their in vitro off-target screening platform. Overall, clients interested in our NAMs portfolio continues to build. One of our top priorities in the coming years will be to continue expanding this portfolio of premier NAMs capabilities through a combination of partnerships, selective M&A and internal development. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress towards the NAMS-enabled future.\nRMS revenue was $213.3 million, an increase of 2.3% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily driven by the timing of NHP shipments and higher revenue for research model services including in the GEMS and Insourcing Solutions business. The overall trends in the RMS segment are consistent from our commentary last quarter as little has changed aside from the typical quarterly modulations in the timing of NHP shipments to third-party clients in China and for Noveprim As a result, we are maintaining our RMS revenue outlook for the year of flat to slightly positive organic growth. The third quarter is expected to be an even stronger quarter for NHP revenue due to the acceleration of certain shipments from the fourth quarter.\nRevenue from both our academic and government client segments increased in the second quarter despite frequent headlines of our potential NIH budget cuts. To date, we have only experienced a small impact from the uncertainty in Washington due to a modest reduction in scope of an in-sourcing solutions contract for the NIH's National Institute on Aging, totaling an expected revenue loss of approximately $3 million annually. Beyond that, we have not experienced any meaningful revenue loss related to NIH budgets to date. As a reminder, north American academic and government client base represents just over 20% of total RMS revenue or approximately 6% of total company revenue.\nIn addition, demand for Insourcing Solutions CRADL operations is tracking as planned and occupancy remained stable since our last update. CRADL revenue increased slightly in the second quarter versus the prior year, but as we discussed in May, demand from early-stage biotech clients for our CRADL services remains constrained this year due to funding challenges. Revenue for small research models in all geographic regions was relatively flat overall as higher pricing continued to offset unit volume declines. China was an exception as volume continued to increase albeit at a more moderate pace than historical levels.\nIn the second quarter, the RMS operating margin increased by 220 basis points to 25.3%. The improvement was primarily due to a favorable mix resulting from higher NHP revenue and higher revenue from research model services as well as the benefit of cost savings resulting from our restructuring initiatives. We expect the third quarter RMS operating margin will also be robust due to the favorable timing of NHP shipments that are accelerating into the third quarter, followed by the moderation of the fourth quarter operating margin due to the timing of NHP revenue and normal seasonality in the small models business.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $200.8 million, a 2.9% increase on an organic basis from the second quarter of last year. The revenue improvement was driven by another solid quarter from our Microbial Solutions business as well as revenue from commercial CDMO clients, most of which will not repeat in the second half of the year as one relationship has wound down, creating an anticipated revenue and margin headwind. The Biologics Testing business had another slow quarter due to project delays associated with regulatory or funding issues for several clients.\nCollectively, we continue to expect Manufacturing revenue will be essentially flat on an organic basis this year, which is similar to the first half performance. The Microbial Solutions business reported another quarter of robust growth, led by our Accugenix microbial identification services and Celsis microbial detection platform. Endosafe also performed well as clients continue to choose our leading portfolio of rapid manufacturing quality control testing solutions. We believe Microbial Solutions is well positioned to grow at a high single-digit revenue growth rate for the year as it did in the first 2 quarters.\nThe Cell and Gene Therapy CDMO business reported essentially flat revenue, principally related to work for one commercial cell therapy client to wind down and transfer their program, and revenue from our gene therapy offering also continued to be strong. While our CDMO relationship with one commercial client has ended, we look forward to continuing to work on our other commercial cell therapy program going forward. Collectively, we expect the loss of commercial CDMO revenue will reduce the Manufacturing Solutions growth rate by less than 500 basis points for the year. However, CDMO revenue grew nicely in the second quarter when normalized for the commercial cell therapy revenue impact.\nWe are continuing to enhance the quality of our operations, build our gene therapy presence and reinforce our healthy pipeline of biotech clients with early-stage clinical candidates and are continuing to gain traction with those clients.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin increased by 620 basis points to 32.8% in the second quarter, due principally to revenue and payments from commercial CDMO clients as well as operating leverage from Microbial Solutions robust growth. Due to the fact that revenue from one commercial CDMO client will not repeat, we do not expect the manufacturing operating margin to be above 30% level for the second half of the year. However, we believe the progress we have made on the cost structure and the operating leverage that we are able to generate from the robust growth in the Microbial Solutions business will result in a higher manufacturing operating margin for the year.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to briefly address our ongoing strategic review and also provide a positive update on NHP supply. First, the strategic review is well underway, and I am encouraged by the progress that we have made so far. This thorough process takes time, but we are moving forward with a sense of urgency and do not intend to provide updates until the strategic review has been completed. This is a comprehensive process that is evaluating multiple avenues for value creation, including a strategic review of our portfolio, capital allocation strategy and market position while balancing it with the understanding that the strength and value of Charles River lies within our broad scientifically distinguished portfolio and leading nonclinical market position that truly differentiates us from the competition.\nOur goal is to further enhance long-term shareholder value, and we continue to believe that the company remains undervalued. We are pleased with the progress that we have made this year at the company, including the substantially better performance of the DSA segment and actions to unlock value through stock repurchases and cost savings, which we believe leaves us well positioned for the future.\nWith regards to the NHP supply update, in July, the Department of Interior and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cleared for legal entry into the United States all of the NHP shipments from Cambodia from late 2022 and early 2023 that were under investigation. In addition, we have been informed that the U.S. Department of Justice is no longer conducting investigations into these shipments. These positive developments validate what we have said from the start. Once the DOJ investigated, they would conclude that any concerns with respect to Charles River's conduct are without merit.\nI would like to thank our shareholders, clients and employees for their patience, trust and support as we navigated this process. Now Flavia will provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance and updated 2025 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nWe are pleased with our second quarter performance, which included revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeding the outlook provided in May. This outcome was primarily driven by operational improvement from better-than-expected DSA results and, to a lesser extent, a $0.12 benefit from lower tax rate and a $0.03 benefit from favorable FX rates in the quarter. As a result of the second quarter outperformance, we're raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. We now expect full year reported revenue will decline 0.5% to 2.5% and organic revenue will decline 1% to 3%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be in a range of $9.90 to $10.30. The $0.55 guidance raise for 2025 at midpoint is expected to be driven by two main components: operational outperformance in the second quarter and a favorable movement in foreign exchange rates from our forecast in May. As you may recall, we forecast FX based on recent bank forecast rates rather than current rates. Based on the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange will represent an approximate 50 basis point tailwind to 2025 revenue compared to our prior outlook of an approximate 1% headwind. This 150 basis point revenue benefit translates into about a $0.14 contribution to EPS, with most of this EPS benefit in the second half of the year.\nOur outlook for the tax rate and interest expense have also been updated since May, but the net EPS impact will largely offset each other. I'll discuss each of these items shortly. Our updated EPS guidance implies that the second half operating margin will be below the first half level of 20.7%. This is largely for reasons consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and the gap was further widened by our first half outperformance. For the year, we now expect the consolidated operating margin will be in a range between flat and a 30 basis point decline, which represents an improvement from our prior expectations of a 20 to 50 basis point decline due to our outperformance to date and operating leverage from the increased revenue outlook.\nOur full year operating margin outlook also includes several headwinds, which are occurring in the second half of the year. The first headwind is in the CDMO business and primarily relates to commercial cell therapy revenue that will not repeat in the second half since one commercial relationship has ended. The CDMO revenue generated from this client was sizable in the first half at approximately $20 million. The second is hiring in the DSA segment, where we need more people in order to accommodate the current and forecasted demand. As Jim mentioned, additional DSA staffing in the second half represents an approximate $10 million cost headwind versus the first half. And finally, the timing of annual merit increases for our employees was at the beginning of July this year in most geographies, which creates a headwind when comparing to the first half.\nTo be clear, the CDMO and merit timing-related headwinds were known and contemplated in our initial outlook. Our decision to begin investing back into DSA headcount was a result of the improved demand trajectory this year and to appropriately position staffing levels for the remainder of 2025 and as we move into next year.\nBy segment, our updated revenue outlook for 2025 can be found on Slide 33. Aside from FX modifications to the reported growth rates, the only change to our segment revenue outlook is that due primarily to the second quarter outperformance, we now expect DSA organic revenue to decline at a low to mid-single-digit rate, better than our prior outlook of a mid-single-digit decline. And as a reminder, this does not require an improvement in our net book-to-bill metrics. And for the RMS and Manufacturing segments, those outlooks remain unchanged.\nUnallocated corporate costs totaled $60.7 million in the second quarter or 5.9% of revenue compared to 4.9% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily due to higher performance-based compensation. The higher bonus accruals will also result in an incremental earnings headwind in the second half, which is the opposite impact of last year when bonuses were a tailwind. As a result, for the full year, we now expect unallocated corporate costs will be at approximately 5.5% of total revenue or the upper end of our prior outlook of 5% to 5.5%.\nI will now provide an update on the nonoperating items, starting with our favorable outlook for interest expense and our higher tax rate expectations for the year. As I mentioned, these items will largely offset each other and not have a meaningful impact on our EPS guidance. Total adjusted net interest expense was $28.9 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $2.4 million sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by the impact from short-term borrowing to facilitate the first quarter stock repurchases. For the full year, we now expect total net interest expense will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million or approximately $7 million to $12 million lower than our prior outlook. This improvement will primarily be a result of our diligent capital activity including shifting that to lower interest rate geographies.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had outstanding debt of $2.3 billion with approximately 65% at a fixed interest rate compared to $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. As a result of that repayment, the gross and net leverage ratios also declined to 2.3x at the end of the second quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 22.7%, representing an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the impact from stock-based compensation. However, the second quarter tax rate was more favorable than our prior expectation; benefiting EPS by approximately $0.12 because of the timing of the enactment of certain global minimum tax provisions as well as an increase in foreign tax credits.\nFor the full year, the tax rate will now be an earnings headwind that had not been anticipated at the beginning of the year. This will more than offset the second quarter favorability because of U.S. tax legislation changes enacted on July 4 as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OB3, which allows for accelerated bonus depreciation and expensing for domestic R&D expenditures. These changes will increase the effective tax rate in the short term but generate over $40 million of cash tax savings this year and, therefore, increase free cash flow. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter will be elevated to the 25% to 30% range due to the enactment of OB3 and expected enactment of certain global minimum tax provisions. And for the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate outlook will increase by approximately 100 basis points to a range of 23.5% to 24.5%.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter remained strong at $169.3 million, an increase from a $154 million. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. CapEx was $35.3 million or approximately 3% of revenue in the second quarter compared to $39.5 million last year, reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending. For the year, we expect that free cash flow will be $430 million to $407 million, an increase from our prior outlook of $350 million to $390 million, primarily driven by stronger earnings, anticipated cash tax savings resulting from the recent tax legislation changes and continued working capital management. CapEx will be approximately $230 million, consistent with our prior outlook, and continues to be well below our peak capital spending in recent years.\nStrong free cash flow generation is one of the hallmarks of Charles River, and the increase this year will enable us to repay debt more quickly and position us to continue investing in our strategic priorities.\nA summary of our 2025 financial guidance can be found on Slide 39. Looking ahead to the quarter, we expect reported and organic revenue will decline between 2% to 4% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, we expect manufacturing and DSA revenue will decrease moderately in the third quarter, partially offset by higher RMS revenue due to the favorable timing of NHP shipments in the quarter, a portion of which accelerated from the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to decline at a low double-digit rate year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower commercial revenue and associated client payments in the CDMO business and increased staffing in the DSA segment as well as the meaningfully higher tax rate within the 25% to 30% range for the quarter.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, which reflects stronger-than-expected demand and solid operational execution. Our restructuring program, the goal of which has been to reduce our cost structure by over 5%, is on track to deliver annualized cost savings of over $175 million in 2025 and approximately $225 million in 2026. In addition, the repurchase of $350 million in shares during the first quarter reinforces our commitment to maximize shareholder value and diligently deploy capital. We remain confident in the resilience of our business and are committed to be financially disciplined as we drive long-term value creation. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions. ."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories' First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the first quarter of 2025. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through the next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated. During this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Todd, and thank you all for joining us today. Before discussing our first quarter results, I'd like to take a few minutes to directly address an important regulatory development, the FDA's announcement last month outlining their goal to accelerate the validation and adoption of New Approach Methods, or NAMS, to reduce animal testing in preclinical safety assessment. I will also provide an update on our own ongoing strategy around alternative methods which we will continue to incorporate into our business in the future.\nCharles River supports the FDA's vision to leverage scientific advancement to safely advance innovative technologies, including alternatives to animal use. As the leader in preclinical drug development, our long-standing mission is aligned with this vision as we continue to drive greater efficiency in the drug development process and reduce costs, enhance scientific innovation and promote the responsible use of animals in biomedical research. Our perspective on leading through a NAMs-enabled future is as follows: First, the evolution of NAMs is not new and demonstrates that scientific advancements are continuing to move forward. For more than 50 years, efforts to reduce animal use by Charles River and industry have led to a gradual decline in research model volumes. These efforts include better translational models and technologies, such as genetically modified and immunodeficient models that can mimic human disease. For example, volumes of outbred rodents often used in safety assessment have been roughly halved over the past 10 years due to the use of more complex and predictive models, technologies and services, including imaging and in vitro applications, all while our revenue has increased significantly.\nNAMs are part of this broader trend. For many years, CROs like Charles River, the biopharmaceutical industry and the FDA and international regulatory agencies have been evaluating strategies to use NAMs as tools to complement traditional methods, and in some cases, to potentially eliminate certain animal tests. Through this evolution, the promise of NAMs will be balanced with the importance of patient safety and science. NAMs are beginning to offer exciting opportunities for the future, but they are not capable of fully replacing animal studies in biomedical research and safety testing. Each NAMs tool will require rigorous validation to prove it can consistently replicate the complexity of living systems and ensure patient safety.\nThere are applications where NAMs may play a valuable role more quickly, such as monoclonal antibodies, but significant scientific advancements and validation will be required before alternative methods can become more widely adopted. This technology to mimic a complex living organism doesn't exist today. Therefore, we believe there will be incremental progress over time, and the broader adoption of NAMs will be a longer-term journey, one that is much longer than 3 to 5 years.\nAs the science continues to advance, we believe the biopharmaceutical industry and regulators will maintain a keen focus on ensuring patient safety without compromise. As NAMs evolve, we intend to advance hybrid study designs by complementing traditional in vivo and in vitro methods with NAMs and other nonanimal technologies. Given the current state of science and technology, NAMs are still primarily used in drug discovery because of the narrower focus on drug design and optimization, whereas in safety assessment, a more comprehensive approach is required to determine the full systemic or multi-organ impacts of a drug. Chronic or longer-term assessments of a drug's impact are also critical, as well as off-target or unintended effects, which NAMs can't fully replicate at this time. However, similar to applications in drug discovery, we believe a hybrid model submitting NAMs data in parallel with animal data will prove to be the best approach to ensure patient safety for regulated safety testing over the long term.\nUltimately, we believe the future isn't binary. The use of animals will remain beneficial to support certain complex safety and efficacy endpoints, even as hybrid study designs that incorporate both NAMs and animal data gain traction. As a result, we view this as an opportunity for Charles River, and we will continue to expand our nonanimal platforms. Our leadership in preclinical drug development is not confined to animal models. It is rooted in science and innovation, regulatory insights and translational expertise. That expertise is equally applicable to NAMs, for which we have a growing portfolio of capabilities. We will continue to invest heavily in these capabilities through organic innovation, technology partnerships and targeted M&A.\nAs regulatory expectations continue to evolve, our clients are seeking trusted partners to help them navigate the transition. Charles River is the logical partner to assist biopharmaceutical clients to validate and advance the use of NAMs because of the scientific data that we possess and our regulatory expertise. Drug development is ultimately about scientific data, and we have generated significant client databases of toxicology information over our 25 years in the industry that can help create more predictive and efficient safety methodologies that do not compromise patient safety.\nCharles River has a well-established commitment to and track record for the replacement, reduction and refinement, or the 3 Rs of ethical animal use for biomedical research and has supported the FDA's efforts as well as the NIH's to advance the validation and adoption of NAMs over many years. We have recognized this trajectory of science and technology for many years. And in April 2024, we formalized our own Alternative Methods Advancement Project, or AMAP initiative, dedicated to advancing the development of alternatives to reducing animal testing.\nWe have made strategic investments over the past decade in areas that are central to the NAMs ecosystem with growing capabilities that include steroid, organoid and organ-on-a-chip platforms, human tissue models, in silico modeling, advanced in vitro toxicology and predictive immunotoxicology assays. We have also invested in projects using [ computational ] modeling to increase efficiency and reduce animal usage, as exemplified by our Logica platform pairing AI with traditional methods. We acquired the Retrogenix cell microarray technology for off-target screening and toxicity. And we also launched a pilot program to replace animals with virtual control groups for safety assessment studies.\nSlide 9 in our earnings presentation showcases the current state of NAMs and our capabilities across the various NAMs platforms. In total, we generate approximately $200 million of annual DSA revenue from NAMs, much of which is in the discovery phase. We believe our NAMs capabilities and associated revenue will grow meaningfully over time as gradual technological progress continues.\nI'd like to take a moment to address the potential financial impact to Charles River from the FDA announcement. The FDA has focused on monoclonal antibodies for its pilot program, specifically to reduce the duration of chronic NHP studies. We believe the FDA chose this path because on a case-by-case basis, it has already been waiving certain chronic post-IND NHP studies for monoclonal antibodies for many years using a weighted evidence model because the scientific data has demonstrated that in many cases, there is limited benefit to conducting additional chronic NHP studies. This is likely because monoclonal antibodies generally show less toxicity than small molecule drugs and have a lower risk for unexpected reactions. In addition, certain monoclonal antibodies have no relevant research models to use in safety testing. Chronic NHP studies longer than 3 months in monoclonal antibodies represented $50 million of our annual revenue. We do not expect any immediate impact on our business.\nOn Slide 11, we have provided an updated view of our Safety Assessment revenue by drug modality for reference. As you can see, the bulk of our revenue is from small molecule and newer advanced biological drugs, including cell and gene therapies. The FDA has not yet focused on these other drug modalities because understanding the safety profile can be more complex and less predictable than monoclonal antibodies. And in the case of newer biologic drugs, there is also less data available to support non-animal-based risk assessments. Therefore, extensive validation work and scientific advancements are needed to safely complement the current in vivo protocols with new alternative methods. This will take a significant amount of time and require resources and collaboration between the FDA, NIH and other agencies, as well as the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe applaud the FDA's ongoing efforts to reduce animal use. And while the transition to NAMs is evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, it's an important one for biomedical research and one that Charles River is prepared to lead. In the coming years, we look forward to continuing to work with regulatory agencies, the biopharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders to help develop, validate and implement an efficient process for our clients' regulatory submissions that supports the use of nonanimal technologies and new alternative methods. As we always have, Charles River will remain committed to following the best and latest science to ensure patient safety.\nNow I'd like to provide an update on the market trends. Despite considerable uncertainty in the broader market environment, our first quarter financial results demonstrated continued signs of stabilization with a better-than-expected DSA performance, leading us to modestly increase our financial guidance for the year. We were pleased to see the DSA net book-to-bill return to just above 1x for the first time in over 2 years due to improved quarterly bookings. While this is a positive development for the DSA segment, we remain cautious in light of recent market dynamics, including government funding cuts, particularly at the NIH and FDA, the slower start for biotech funding and tariffs. These developments have understandably contributed to a broader sense of uncertainty in the marketplace. While we have not yet seen a meaningful impact on client demand, which continues to show signs of stabilization, we have taken a measured and prudent approach to our outlook for the year.\nI'll now provide highlights of our first quarter performance. We reported revenue of $984.2 million in the first quarter of 2025, a 2.7% decrease compared to last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 1.8%, driven by low single-digit organic decreases in each of our 3 business segments. Our first quarter revenue performance was above our February outlook for a mid-single-digit decline due primarily to the DSA segment's performance, for which I will provide more details shortly.\nBy client segment, revenue for small and midsized biotech clients grew for a second consecutive quarter. Revenue for global biopharmaceutical clients declined in the first quarter, but this was due at least in part to the fact that we have not yet anniversaried the spending reductions which began in the second half of last year. Collectively, our global academic and government revenue increased slightly in the quarter.\nThe operating margin was 19.1%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of cost savings resulting from restructuring initiatives that promoted margin expansion in the DSA segment. Favorable mix in the DSA segment also contributed, as did unallocated corporate costs, which declined year-over-year as expected. Earnings per share were $2.34 in the first quarter, an increase of 3.1% from the first quarter of last year. In addition to operating margin improvement, below the line items, including reductions in the tax rate, interest expense and diluted shares outstanding were contributors to earnings growth. Flavia will provide more details on these items.\nBased primarily on the first quarter DSA outperformance and our current visibility, balanced by a cautious approach to the second half of the year, we are modestly raising our 2025 revenue guidance by 100 basis points to a 2.5% to 4.5% decrease organically and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.20 at midpoint to $9.30 to $9.80.\nI'd now like to provide you with additional details on our first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the first quarter was $592.6 million, a decrease of 1.4% on an organic basis driven primarily by lower revenue for Discovery Services. DSA pricing improved slightly in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by favorable mix, specifically an increase in longer duration specialty studies. We do not believe this signals broader improvement in the spot pricing environment, which we would continue to characterize as stable overall.\nMoving to the DSA demand KPIs on Slide 19. The DSA backlog was $1.99 billion at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from $1.97 billion at year-end. You should note that beginning this quarter, we have disclosed our net bookings and net book-to-bill data. This is the first time we are providing this information because we believe it will provide additional transparency into these important KPIs, particularly when foreign exchange can have a notable impact on backlog, as it did in the fourth quarter.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we were pleased that the net book-to-bill improved to 1.04x in the first quarter, above 1x for the first time since the second half of 2022. This was primarily a result of quarterly net booking activity, which improved to $616 million, representing a more than 20% increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. This improvement was driven by higher gross bookings, principally from global biopharmaceutical clients, as well as a continued decline in study cancellations moving towards targeted levels across all client segments, including small and midsize biotechs.\nThe incremental first quarter booking activity could largely be characterized for studies with quicker start dates, which is more reflective of our current shorter-term booking behaviors in the current market environment. We expect this will benefit revenue in the first half of this year, including the studies that were already started in the first quarter that led to the better-than-expected performance. Based on this trend, we are modestly increasing our full year revenue guidance for the DSA segment. We now expect DSA organic revenue will decline in the mid-single-digit range, rather than our prior outlook of a mid- to high single-digit decline. As I mentioned, we expect the improved first quarter bookings will generate incremental revenue during the first half of the year, also augmented by the favorable study mix during the first quarter.\nAt this point, given the current visibility, the generally conscious sentiment in the sector and our expectation that the study mix will normalize, we are not assuming that a similar bookings tailwind will continue to benefit second half revenue. However, as I said earlier, we have not seen any meaningful evidence of deterioration in our markets.\nThe DSA operating margin increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 23.9% in the first quarter. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflected cost savings generated from our restructuring initiatives, as well as the favorable study mix in the first quarter.\nRMS revenue was $213.1 million, a decrease of 2.5% on an organic basis compared to the first quarter of 2024. RMS performed in line with expectations to start the year. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by the timing of NHP shipments in China and lower revenue for the Cell Solutions business, partially offset by higher revenue for small research models in all geographic regions, driven primarily by higher pricing.\nSmall research models remain essential, low-cost tools for biomedical research, which enhances our ability to continue to realize price increases globally. However, there have been growing concerns from our academic and government clients that propose NIH budget cuts, and uncertainty in Washington could impact their future funding levels. We have not experienced any meaningful revenue loss related to NIH budgets to date, and first quarter revenue from our North American academic and government clients increased slightly. As a reminder, this North American client base represents just over 20% of total RMS revenue, or approximately 6% of total company revenue. Any potential NIH budget cuts would be unlikely to impact client spending levels until later this year or into 2026.\nIn addition, demand from early-stage biotech clients for our CRADL services is expected to be constrained this year due to their funding challenges. We believe this will slow the anticipated utilization of CRADL capacity during the year. As a result of these 2 potential headwinds, we are moderating our RMS outlook for the year to flat to slightly positive revenue growth on an organic basis compared to our previous expectation of low single-digit growth.\nIn the first quarter, the RMS operating margin decreased by 50 basis points to 27.1%. The decline was primarily a result of the lower NHP revenue, partially offset by the benefit of cost savings resulting from our restructuring initiatives.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $178.5 million, a 2.2% decrease on an organic basis from the first quarter of last year. The revenue decline was driven primarily by lower commercial revenue in the CDMO business and a slow start to the year for the Biologics Testing business. Overall, the Manufacturing segment started the year in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our prior outlook that Manufacturing revenue will be essentially flat on an organic basis in 2025.\nAs you know, first quarter testing volumes in the Biologics Testing business can fluctuate based on seasonal trends. The business had a stronger start last year. However, we continue to expect that Biologics Testing revenue will grow in 2025, and this outlook was supported by solid booking activity in the first quarter.\nOur cell and gene therapy CDMO business was impacted by the lower revenue from 2 commercial cell therapy clients, which we discussed earlier in the year. The loss of commercial CDMO revenue reduced the Manufacturing Solutions growth rate by approximately 500 basis points in the first quarter and is expected to have a similar impact for the full year. We are continuing to make progress to enhance the quality of our CDMO operations.\nWe were also pleased to see that our gene therapy CDMO revenue grew in the quarter. We have a healthy pipeline of biotech clients with early-stage clinical candidates ready to help move the CDMO business forward and continue to believe attractive long-term growth opportunities exist. Offsetting these headwinds, the Microbial Solutions business reported another quarter of solid growth across its leading portfolio of rapid manufacturing quality control testing solutions, led by Accugenix microbial identification services. Endosafe also performed well as a result of growth for testing consumables, and a strong high throughput, automated nexus instrument placements last year are driving incremental cartridge demand. We expect Microbial Solutions will remain a stable source of high single-digit revenue growth for Charles River, demonstrating that clients are increasingly utilizing our comprehensive testing solutions to enhance their product release testing speed and efficiency.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 220 basis points to 23.1% in the first quarter of 2025 due principally to the impact of lower commercial revenue in the CDMO business. We believe the Manufacturing segment's margin will rebound as sales volume improves, particularly in the Biologics Testing business, and will move closer to the 30% level during the year.\nBefore I turn it over to Flavia, I would also like to discuss this morning's announcement regarding our actions to enhance value creation opportunities at the company in conjunction with our new shareholders, Elliott Investment Management. First, we are pleased to welcome Steven Barg, Abe Ceesay, Mark Enyedy and Paul Graves to our Board. Each brings significant professional and industry experience and will add fresh perspectives as we continue to execute our strategy and identify the best avenues for further growth and value creation.\nI would also like to sincerely thank the 4 members of our Board who are not seeking reelection: Bob Bertolini, Debbie Kochevar, George Massaro and Richard Wallman. I appreciate the expertise and strategic counsel that each of you have provided to the company and to me over the many years that you have served on our Board, which have contributed to our enduring industry leadership, and we wish each of you the very best.\nIn addition, the Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee of our Board will undertake a comprehensive strategic review of our business to evaluate initiatives to unlock additional value. We will report back on the outcome of the Board's review once complete. I look forward to working with each of our new and continuing Board members and the Elliott team as we focus on maximizing long-term value for our investors, clients and employees.\nI firmly believe the company shares are significantly undervalued, particularly after the FDA's announcement last month, so implementing additional value creation initiative is both necessary and timely. I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support. Now Flavia will provide additional details on our first quarter financial performance and updated 2025 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nWe are pleased that our first quarter revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our prior outlook. This outcome was primarily driven by better-than-expected DSA results and, to a lesser extent, a lower tax rate. These results also reflect the actions we have taken to protect the operating margin. For the past 2 years, we have taken aggressive actions through our restructuring program to reduce our cost structure by over 5% and align our infrastructure with the current demand, which contributed to the first quarter operating margin improvement and earnings growth, even with a modest revenue decline.\nWe remain on track to deliver annualized cost savings of over $175 million in 2025 and approximately $225 million in 2026. We are also continuing to deploy capital in a disciplined and shareholder-focused manner. As announced last quarter, we're leveraging our solid annual free cash flow generation and completed the repurchase of $350 million in shares during the first quarter of 2025. For modeling purposes, including the stock repurchases to date, we will have slightly below 50 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. In just over 2 quarters, since the $1 billion stock repurchase program was authorized, we have repurchased nearly half of this amount. As Jim referenced, we currently believe the company is significantly undervalued, and we'll closely review opportunities for value creation, including additional stock repurchases.\nWe also experienced a significant increase in quarterly free cash flow, with $112.4 million generated in the first quarter compared to $50.7 million last year. The improvement was primarily driven by lower performance-based cash bonus payments for 2024, which are paid in the first quarter, and by lower capital expenditures. CapEx was $59.3 million or approximately 6% of revenue in the first quarter compared to $79.1 million last year, reflecting the ongoing moderation of our capacity investments in the current demand environment. For the year, we expect that free cash flow will be $350 million to $390 million, and CapEx will be approximately $230 million, consistent with our prior outlook.\nAs Jim mentioned, we have modestly raised our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. We now expect full year reported revenue will decline 3.5% to 5.5% and organic revenue will decline 2.5% to 4.5%. FX rates have been volatile since the election. And as a result, we now expect foreign exchange will represent an approximately 1% headwind to 2025 revenue based on recent bank forecasts, which is favorable to our prior outlook of a 1% to 1.5% headwind. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be in a range of $9.30 to $9.80.\nOur updated segment revenue outlook for 2025 can be found on Slide 36. We are raising our DSA outlook to reflect the solid first quarter performance, including improved bookings, which give us greater confidence in the near term. We're also tempering our IMS outlook, reflecting headwinds related to our CRADL business and potentially on our academic and government client base later in the year. Our Manufacturing outlook is unchanged on an organic basis. We expect the consolidated operating margin will decline 20 to 50 basis points in 2025, or largely consistent with our prior outlook of modestly lower.\nI will now provide details on the nonoperating items that benefited our first quarter performance versus the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs totaled $52.4 million in the first quarter, or 5.3% of revenue, compared to 6.2% of revenue last year. The decrease was primarily due to the benefits of cost savings actions. For the full year, we expect unallocated corporate costs will be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of total revenue.\nThe non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 22.7%, representing a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. The first quarter tax rate was slightly favorable to our prior outlook, due primarily to the timing of the enactment of certain global minimum taxes, as well as higher R&D tax credits. For the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, consistent with our prior outlook.\nI'd like to briefly address the recent headlines around tariffs. Based on the current universal tariffs in place as of May 7, we expect a limited direct impact on -- on an annual basis principally related to NHP supply and other study-related items, and we plan to offset most of these estimated tariffs by passing along the higher costs. This has been factored in our current guidance.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense was $26.5 million in the first quarter, essentially unchanged sequentially. For the full year, we expect total net interest expense will be at the lower end of our prior outlook of $112 million to $117 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had outstanding debt of $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% at a fixed interest rate compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. As a result of the higher debt at the end of the first quarter, gross leverage increased to 2.5x and net leverage increased to 2.4x. The sequential increases in debt and the leverage ratios were primarily attributable to the short-term borrowings for stock repurchases, which we expect to largely repay through our cash flow over the course of the year. A summary of our 2025 financial guidance can be found on Slide 40.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect reported and organic revenue will decline at a low to mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. Earnings per share are expected to improve nicely from the first quarter level with a mid- to high single-digit sequential increase over the $2.34.\nIn summary, we were pleased that our financial performance in the first quarter benefited from the disciplined implementation of the cost-saving initiatives that we undertook, and we'll remain focused on continuing to evaluate additional opportunities to drive future savings and operating efficiencies. These actions are important not only to align our operations with current demand and to protect the operating margin, but also as a means to allow us to continue to invest in our businesses. We are committed to being at the forefront of scientific innovation, particularly as the industry continues to evolve.\nOur strategic investments and scientific expertise will position us to actively shape the changing regulatory landscape, while maintaining the highest standards of safety and efficacy. We will also evaluate all opportunities to unlock value with the support of our new and continuing Board members and Elliott Investment Management. We're proud of the foundation we've built, and we are energized by the opportunities ahead. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings and 2025 Guidance Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the fourth quarter of '24 as well as our financial guidance for 2025. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated. During this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning. We're pleased to end the year with a fourth quarter performance that was slightly better than expected, yielding annual revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share higher than guidance that we issued in November.\nBefore I provide more details on our fourth quarter results, I will provide an update on the market trends in our 2025 financial guidance. Beginning with an update on the market environment, I can say that our view of biopharmaceutical demand remains consistent with our last update. Overall, DSA demand KPIs, including the net book-to-bill ratio was stable compared to the third quarter and we expect similar trends throughout 2025. Many of our global biopharmaceutical clients continue to move forward with the restructuring and pipeline reprioritization activities which are expected to constrain early-stage spending by many of these clients again in 2025.\nSmall and mid-sized biotechnology clients continued to benefit from a more favorable funding environment through the end of 2024 compared to the previous 2 years, and we expect biotech demand trends will be stable to slightly improved in 2025 versus last year. These combined trends are expected to result in flattish DSA demand sequentially within 2025. However, we expect study volume to be at a lower level than in 2024 because many global biopharmaceutical clients reset their budgets in the middle of last year.\nWe're closely monitoring our clients' R&D spending patterns, the funding environment and interest rates as well as new biotech company formations, which has slowed over the past couple of years and believe our expectations for 2025 are appropriately measured. As discussed at a recent investor conference, the primary factors in influencing our 2025 outlook are as follows. The first relates to our expectation for stabilizing DSA demand environment in 2025, as well as an anticipated headwind from lower DSA pricing throughout the year.\nThe second item is lower commercial revenue in the CDMO business, which will reduce consolidated revenue by approximately 1% in 2025. And finally, our site consolidation actions are expected to reduce revenue by an additional 50 basis points this year. The cumulative effect of these factors is expected to result in a revenue decline of 3.5% to 5.5% on an organic basis this year. And when including a foreign exchange headwind of over 1%, a reported revenue decline of 4.5% to 7%. We have taken significant action to protect the operating margin and shareholder value, including restructuring initiatives that are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately $225 million in 2026, of which over $175 million will be realized this year. However, we will not be able to fully offset the revenue decline in 2025, particularly in the DSA segment, which is expected to result in a modestly lower consolidated operating margin and a non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.10 to $9.60.\nNow I'd like to quickly recap our fourth quarter and full year consolidated performance. We reported revenue of $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a 1.8% decline on an organic basis from the previous year. For the year, we reported revenue of $4.05 billion with an organic revenue decrease of 2.8%, driven primarily by lower DSA revenue. Our full year revenue slightly outperformed the range that we provided in November, led by a better-than-expected fourth quarter performance in the RMS segment and a robust year-end for Microbial Solutions. Sales to both the global biopharmaceutical and small and midsized biotech client segments declined for the full year. But in the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see revenue from biotech clients return to growth for the first time since the third quarter of 2023.\nThe operating margin increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 19.9% in the fourth quarter, principally driven by lower unallocated corporate costs and margin expansion in the manufacturing segment. The cost-saving initiatives also helped to limit the margin declines in the DSA and RMS segments.\nFor the full year, the operating margin declined by 40 basis points to 19.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by the DSA segment as well as higher unallocated corporate costs. Earnings per share were $2.66 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8.1% from $2.46 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion as well as favorable below-the-line items, including reductions in interest expense, the tax rate and share count led to the earnings improvement. For 2024, earnings per share declined by 3.3% to $10.32 due primarily to the lower revenue and operating margin, partially offset by the benefit of cost saving initiatives.\nTurning to segment performance. I'll now provide you with additional details on the fourth quarter and each segment's outlook for 2025. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $603.3 million, a decrease of 3.5% on an organic basis. The decline reflected lower study volume as well as slightly lower pricing. As anticipated, Safety Assessment pricing turned negative in the fourth quarter as the moderating pricing environment during 2024 started to work from backlog into the revenue stream.\nIn the current demand environment, pricing has become a point of discussion with clients, particularly small and midsized biotechs. We have strategically and selectively utilized pricing and other commercial enhancements, including better integration of our DSA sales force with a global -- with the goal to gain additional market share and believe the strategy has been successful as demonstrated by an improved DSA capture rate during 2024. DSA demand KPIs were also stable in the fourth quarter, including the net book-to-bill ratio and cancellation rate, the net book-to-bill remained below 1x in the fourth quarter with global biopharmaceutical and small and midsized biotech client segments in a similar range, this was consistent with the third quarter following the divergence in trends during the second quarter that resulted in revenue to global biopharmaceutical clients taking a step down in the second half of 2024, which will continue to impact 2025.\nCancellations also remained at lower levels in the fourth quarter as they have for most of the past year and closer to targeted levels. We believe the clients have largely completed the process of canceling lower priority programs that will remain in our backlog so that the key for the DSA segment to return to revenue growth will be a sustained improvement in booking activity, which has not yet occurred.\nFor the full year, DSA revenue decreased 6.2% on an organic basis, which was consistent with our expectation in November that DSA revenue would be favorable to our previous outlook of a high single-digit decline. At year-end, the DSA backlog modestly declined to $1.97 billion from $2.12 billion in the -- at the end of the third quarter.\nIn 2025, we expect DSA revenue will decline at a mid- to high single-digit rate on an organic basis which will be slightly less favorable than in 2024. We expect that both lower pricing and steady volume will have a similar impact on the 2025 decline. As I mentioned earlier, we expect study volume will be relatively stable sequentially throughout 2025 for the global biopharmaceutical and biotech client segments, but at a lower level than in 2024, due primarily to the softer demand from global biopharmaceutical clients that emerged in the second half of last year.\nIn addition, lower realized DSA pricing will add an incremental headwind in 2025 that was not present in 2024 when realized pricing was essentially flat for the full year. We have not assumed any meaningful improvement in the DSA demand environment during 2025 at this time for the quarterly gaiting of DSA revenue dollars should be relatively consistent over the course of the year, aside from a modest seasonal impact in the first quarter.\nIn recent weeks, NHP supply has once again made headlines as a result of a recent proposal at the Standing Committee meeting of CITES, an international body that oversees the trade of animals, including NHPs, used in biomedical research to potentially sustain the trade of NHPs from Cambodia. We were very pleased that studies did not enact the trade suspension at the meeting in early February and postponed the agenda item on this matter until the end of the year.\nThis decision underscores the international community's strong support for a fair, accurate and science-based review process providing the necessary time to review the facts and contract on this information being disseminated by other groups. Let me be clear. Charles River firmly believes that any action to restrict the availability of purpose-bred NHPs from Cambodia could have significant and unintended consequences that will impact biomedical research globally. Legally sourced NHPs are critical regulatory required models to help ensure human patient safety and advanced biologics drug development for the global biopharmaceutical industry. Charles River will continue to work collaboratively with regulatory agencies, government officials, industry trade associations and our biopharmaceutical clients to promote patient safety and educate our partners about the scientific importance of NHPs, particularly when viable alternatives do not currently exist.\nWith regard to our NHP supply, we will continue to diligently work to diversify and secure our supply chain by procuring NHPs and the various supply arrangements outside of Cambodia, including through our controlling interest in Noveprim in Mauritius. As a reminder, we will be able to utilize an increasing number of Mauritius NHPs in our DSA segment after 2026.\nIn the appendance of our slide presentation today, we have also updated certain key statistics for 2024 that were included in our NHP report last year. DSA operating margin was 24.7% in the fourth quarter or a 130 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2023, and was 25.7% for the full year of 2024, representing a 180 basis point decline year-over-year. Both the fourth quarter and full year declines were primarily driven by lower revenue which was partially offset by the benefit from cost savings.\nRMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $204.3 million, a decrease of 0.4% on an organic basis. For the year, RMS revenue was essentially flat with just a 0.1% decline on an organic basis. For both the quarter and the year, lower revenue for research model services, including CRADL, NHP sales in China in the Cell Solutions business was mostly offset by higher sales of small research models in all geographic regions, principally driven by higher pricing.\nCell Solutions 2024 growth rate was impacted by the consolidation of its operations to its largest California site. 2025, RMS revenue is expected to increase at a low single-digit rate, driven primarily by higher pricing in the North American and European models businesses, improved growth prospects for research model services including fatal and from higher NHP sales to Noveprim third-party clients. Unit volume for small research models continued to be lower in 2024 due in large part to the softer biopharmaceutical spending environment. However, higher pricing and higher revenue from academic institutions more than offset these unit volume declines.\nWe expect similar trends in 2025 with higher pricing in North America and Europe more than offsetting lower unit volumes. We also expect small models revenue in China to be flattish as the life sciences environment continues to be somewhat challenged. Given the recent news around NIH funding, we will closely monitor the health of our academic and government client base. Our direct exposure to the NIH represents less than 2% of our total revenue, largely related to in-sourcing solutions contracts.\nFor academia, small research models are critical components to academic research projects and consider direct research costs, but we will monitor what, if any, impact the NIH's new directive to cap indirect costs will have on these clients. Overall, large models are not expected to be a significant contributor to RMS revenue growth this year, as anticipated increase in Noveprim's third-party NHP revenue will be partially offset by lower NHP revenue in China.\nDemand for research model services is expected to rebound and become a notable contributor for RMS revenue growth in 2025. Our GEMS business is expected to get back on track as clients increasingly utilize these services to support their complex research efforts and maintenance of the genetically modified model colonies. Moderate growth of CRADL operations is expected to deliver an improved top line performance in 2025, primarily driven by new CRADL sites to limit risk in this tighter budgetary environment, the new sites will either have dedicated or anchor clients.\nClients are continuing to view CRADL as an attractive model to access flexible vivarium space without having to invest in internal infrastructure, which provides a powerful value proposition for clients who are looking to reduce costs and conserve capital. The RMS operating margin decreased by 30 basis points year-over-year to 22.8% in the fourth quarter but increased by 70 basis points to 23.7% in 2024.\nFor the year, the operating margin improvement was primarily due to higher pricing for small research models, cost savings related to our restructuring initiatives and a favorable revenue mix related to higher sales of NHPs due to the Noveprim acquisition. We expect similar drivers to contribute to the RMS operating margin in 2025.\nManufacturing Solutions revenue was $194.9 million in the fourth quarter, growth rate of 2.1% on an organic basis, and the full year organic growth rate was 6.8%. The slower fourth quarter growth rate was primarily driven by lower commercial revenue in the CDMO business, offset by a robust year-end performance for the Microbial Solutions business. These same drivers will likely result in essentially flat manufacturing revenue in 2025 on an organic basis. Biologics testing benefited in 2024 from certain client projects that will not repeat, which will result in a moderated growth rate in 2025.\nAs mentioned at a recent investor conference, we expect lower revenue from 2 commercial CDMO clients will reduce consolidated revenue by approximately 1% in 2025 and the Manufacturing segment's growth rate by more than 5%. Despite the commercial setbacks, we believe our efforts over the past 2 years to enhance the CDMO operations have established a solid foundation for this business through investments in facilities, leadership and scientific expertise.\nAlthough demand in the cell and gene sector is not as robust as it was when we acquired the business in 2021, we believe attractive long-term growth opportunities exist and we have a healthy pipeline of biotech clients with early-stage clinical candidates ready to help move the CDMO business forward. The Microbial Solutions business reported a strong year-end performance with solid growth across all 3 testing platforms, Endosafe, Celsis and Accugenix. Endosafe continued to lead the way with robust growth the testing consumables as well as another strong quarter for instrument placements. We believe the 2024 performance thoroughly demonstrated that demand for microbial products has rebounded and the clients are increasingly utilizing our comprehensive, rapid manufacturing, quality control, testing solutions to enhance their product release, testing speed and efficiency.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin increased by 330 basis points to 28.7% in the fourth quarter and by 560 basis points to 27.4% for the full year. We were pleased by the operating margin expansion, which was driven by operating leverage from improved demand in the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing businesses and our continued focus on generating greater efficiencies across all businesses, including CDMO. We believe the manufacturing segment remains on track to reach its goal to return to an operating margin above the 30% level within a couple of years.\nTo conclude, we are currently operating in a challenging biopharmaceutical demand environment with continued constrained client spending, but we believe that demand trends are stabilizing. On the positive side, biotech is trending favorably. We have not seen signs of further deterioration from our global biopharmaceutical clients. However, we're not forecasting a recovery in 2025. We are taking decisive action to manage the company through the current environment, including appropriately rightsizing our infrastructure and eliminating over 5% of our cost structure. We remain committed to initiatives to generate more revenue, contain costs and protect shareholder value.\nTo ensure our future success, we continue to make progress on strategic actions in these 3 main areas: restructuring and other initiatives to manage costs and generate greater efficiency; by reducing staffing levels to align with the pace of demand; optimizing our global footprint and streamlining processes and operations. We have made meaningful progress on this front and continue to selectively evaluate additional opportunities to cut costs and drive efficiency and now expect to generate approximately $225 million of annualized cost savings from these initiatives.\nThe second area is concentrating on commercial enhancements to promote a client-centric focus and gain additional market share. Our goal is to enhance the client experience and reinforce our role as a flexible and responsive partner to our clients, including through leveraging technologies such as our Apollo platform and our RMS e-commerce initiatives.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our enhancements to our DSA sales force and dynamic pricing strategy have enabled us to gain market share over the past year. And finally, we are taking a balanced approach to capital allocation, and regularly revisiting our best uses for capital. We are very pleased that our leverage remains low in the low 2x range. And as we have routinely done, we continue to evaluate select M&A candidates. Based on our anticipated capital needs this year and coupled with our belief that we are currently undervalued, it is an opportune time to allocate most of our free cash flow to stock repurchases in 2025 under our $1 billion authorization. We intend to repurchase approximately $350 million in stock over the next month or 2, which exceeds our initial goal of $100 million last year to offset annual dilution from equity awards.\nWe have navigated challenges before, and we believe our strategic actions will enable us to emerge from this period a stronger, leaner and more profitable company and an even more responsive partner for our clients. We have always distinguished ourselves through our exquisite science and preclinical focus, extending our leading position as our clients' preferred global nonclinical drug development partner. I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support.\nNow Flavia will provide additional details on our financial performance and 2025 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude a goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2024, amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items.\nMany of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share, slightly exceeding our annual outlook. In the face of a challenging domain environment, we have taken decisive actions to navigate these headwinds.\nOur efforts include aggressive actions to rationalize costs and align our infrastructure with the current demand. As Jim noted, the restructuring initiatives we implemented are expected to result in approximately $225 million in annualized cost savings in 2026, including over $175 million realized this year, slightly ahead of our prior target as we selectively implemented smaller additional initiatives.\nThe multiyear cost savings program is expected to reduce our cost structure by over 5% through headcount reductions and network rationalization efforts, the majority of which are underway and are on track. To further balance our capital structure, we leverage our strong cash flow generation to repurchase $100 million in stock in the third quarter of 2024, achieving our goal to offset the annual share count dilution from equity awards.\nAs Jim mentioned, under the $1 billion Board authorization, we intend to increase the level of stock repurchases in 2025 to approximately $350 million. We believe allocating free cash flow to stock repurchases this year will be prudent in light of our low leverage levels and our current valuation, which is certainly depressed because of the current industry headwinds but also does not ascribe enough value to the favorable long-term growth fundamentals that we expect to again reemerge once the biopharmaceutical industry refocuses on investing in their pipelines.\nWe are particularly pleased with our strong free cash flow generation of $501.6 million in 2024. This achievement reflects the effectiveness of our tightly managed capital expenditures, disciplined working capital management and the early success of our cost savings initiatives. By maintaining a balanced approach to capital deployment, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nI will now provide additional details on our 2025 outlook. As Jim discussed, 2024 reflected a constrained biopharmaceutical spending environment, which is expected to persist into 2025. Therefore, we expect a reported revenue decline of 4.5% to 7%, including the foreign exchange headwind and 3.5% to 5.5% on an organic basis. FX has become more of a headwind in recent months as the U.S. dollar has strengthened and is now expected to reduce reported revenue by 1% to 1.5%. We have provided additional information on FX rates and our currency exposure in the appendix to our slide presentation.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $9.10 to $9.60. On a segment basis, we have also provided the reported and organic revenue outlook for 2025 on Slide 31. In 2025, we expect the consolidated operating margin will be modestly lower from 19.9% in 2024 as the cost savings associated with restructuring initiatives will not fully offset the lower revenue this year. This is particularly true in the DSA segment for which we expect an operating margin decline. However, there are opportunities for margin expansion in the RMS and Manufacturing segments.\nUnallocated corporate costs in 2025 are expected to be approximately 5% of total revenue. These expenses normalized in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 5.2% of revenue, primarily driven by performance-based bonus. However, the 40 basis point increase to 5.7% for full year 2024 was primarily attributable to higher health and fringe-related costs throughout the year.\nWe expect corporate costs to decrease in 2025 because of benefits from cost saving actions. The non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, an increase from 21.3% in 2024. The anticipated increase in the tax rate is principally due to an increase in the global minimum tax as well as a modest impact related to stock-based compensation.\nIn addition, we have not assumed that discrete tax items, which benefited 2024 will repeat. As it's typically the case due to the timing of equity awards vesting, the headwind from stock-based compensation will be more pronounced in the first half of the year, including an expected first quarter tax rate in the mid-20% range.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense in 2025 is expected to be in the range of $112 million to $117 million, compared to $117.7 million last year. The slight decrease will be primarily driven by lower interest rates on floating rate debt. We do expect to borrow during the year to balance the timing of the stock repurchases earlier in the year with the free cash flow that we will generate, but overall, expect debt balances will be similar at the end of 2025.\nIn 2024, we lowered our net interest expense by repaying approximately $400 million in debt, the highest repayment in recent years, bringing our growth and net leverage ratio to 2.2x at year-end. Additionally, in December, we amended our existing credit agreement to establish a revolver with borrowing capacity of up to $2 billion, reduced from our previous $3 billion facility due to our lower current leverage and anticipated capital needs.\nImportantly, we are able to obtain competitive pricing on this new agreement. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had outstanding debt of $2.2 billion with approximately 2/3 at a fixed interest rate compared to $2.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. For 2025, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $390 million, representing a decrease from $501.6 million in 2024. The decrease will be driven by lower earnings and higher working capital to build inventories, particularly for NHPs and stabilization of receivables after favorable collections in 2024.\nCapital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be essentially flat from 2024 levels at approximately 6% of total revenue or about $230 million, with projects primarily related to a mix of maintenance capital and the completion of ongoing projects. This outlook reflects our disciplined approach to aligning capacity and capital investments with client demand and is well below our peak CapEx in recent years of 8.2% of revenue.\nA summary of our 2025 financial guidance can be found on Slide 37. With regard to the first quarter of 2025, we expect revenue will decline at a mid-single-digit rate on an organic basis and at a mid- to high single-digit decline on a reported basis due to several factors, including first quarter seasonality in the DSA and biologics testing businesses as well as a modest headwind from the timing of NHP shipments.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of at least $2 in the first quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by lower operating margin due in part to the seasonal business trends and the timing of NHP shipments. And as I mentioned, we expect a meaningfully higher tax rate in the mid-20% range, reflecting a headwind from stock-based compensation. Unallocated corporate costs will also remain slightly above 5% of revenue in the first quarter. We expect revenue and operating margin will improve after the first quarter, principally as we move beyond the seasonal trends at the beginning of the year.\nIn conclusion, we are confident in our ability to emerge from this period of softer demand as a stronger, more agile organization. Our decisive actions, including aggressive cost optimization initiatives, stock repurchases and a disciplined approach to capital management, demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We believe our leaner infrastructure will position us well to capitalize on new business opportunities when they emerge and drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take questions."

Just a reminder, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Todd Spencer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Spencer, please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the second quarter of 2024. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com.\nA webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nIn accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. I will begin by providing highlights of our second quarter performance and revised guidance.\nWe reported revenue of $1.03 billion in the second quarter of 2024, a 3.2% decline on both the reported and organic basis over last year. The top line performance was in line with our outlook as organic revenue growth in the Manufacturing segment was more than offset by DSA and RMS revenue declines.\nBy client segment, we continued to experience lower revenue from small and midsized biotech clients in the second quarter, while revenue from global biopharmaceutical clients increased modestly. I'll provide more details on the evolving trends within these 2 client segments shortly.\nThe operating margin was 21.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year-over-year. The increase was principally driven by lower performance-based bonus compensation accruals in the quarter reflecting the reduction in our financial outlook for the second half of the year. On a segment basis, a higher operating margin in the Manufacturing segment and lower corporate costs were largely offset by lower margins in RMS and the DSA segments. These lower accruals were the largest contributor to the earnings outperformance in the second quarter.\nEarnings per share of $2.80 increased 4.1% year-over-year and exceeded the implied outlook in our prior guidance by approximately $0.40.\nWe are significantly reducing our financial guidance for the year because forward-looking DSA trend data suggests that demand will not improve during the second half of the year as we had previously anticipated, and, in fact, will decline for global biopharmaceutical clients. As a result, we are reducing our revenue outlook to a 3% to 5% decline on an organic basis this year, and non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $9.90 to $10.20.\nWe intend to partially offset the headwinds through aggressive actions to streamline our cost structure, optimize our global footprint and drive greater operating efficiency, which will enable us to limit the bottom line impact going forward. We believe taking these actions will also enable us to emerge from this period of softer demand as a stronger and leaner organization and better positioned to capture new business opportunities.\nBefore I discuss the second quarter business segment performance, I will provide more details on these end market demand trends as well as the actions we are taking to manage through the current environment. Our financial performance to date, including a low single-digit organic revenue decline in the first half, has been largely in line with our initial outlook. However, the lack of a recovery in demand for our biotechnology clients as well as recently emerging and softening demand trends in our global biopharmaceutical client base have caused us to take a much more negative view of our growth prospects for the second half of the year.\nBecause of this, the second half revenue growth that we previously anticipated will not materialize. And in fact, Demand is expected to continue to soften for global biopharmaceutical clients in the near term. These trends for our broader biopharmaceutical client base are expected to lead to a low to mid-single-digit organic revenue decline in the second half of the year on a consolidated basis.\nAs you are aware, most global biopharmaceutical companies have announced major restructuring programs likely precipitated by the IRA or pending patent expirations or both. And this has undoubtedly led to tighter budgets and additional pipeline reprioritization activities this year. Revenue for this client base continued to increase in the second quarter. However, proposal activity and bookings began to notably decline and diverge from biotech clients during the second quarter.\nWe now expect demand for global biopharmaceutical clients to further deteriorate over the remainder of the year. We anticipate these trends are also likely to impact the DSA growth rate into 2025, so we are working now to reset our cost base to both withstand the pressures on our bottom line and to better position the company to when demand cycles back. Large biopharmaceutical companies are currently focused on resetting their budgets to create leaner cost structures. We expect these actions and the resulting softening of our demand KPIs will continue to cause a period of slower spending by large pharma on their early-stage drug development activities, particularly because they are more focused on their clinical pipelines at this time.\nWe believe that these clients continue to view strategic outsourcing as a compelling solution to improve their cost efficiency and speed to market, presenting a longer-term opportunity for us once they inevitably refocus on their preclinical pipelines.\nIn contrast to large pharma, demand KPIs for small and midsized biotech clients have stabilized and trended somewhat more favorably through the first half, reflecting the solid funding environment and favorable sentiment around interest rates. Biotech companies are our largest client base at approximately 40% of total revenue, and more than half of DSA revenue. And DSA proposals and net bookings have improved to this client base this year.\nWe experienced an improvement in biotech booking activity in the second quarter as the higher proposal levels that we commented on last quarter have begun to translate into new business wins. While we are cautiously optimistic that these trends will lead to a future demand recovery in our biotech client base, they're also not sufficient to support the DSA revenue improvement in the second half of the year than we previously anticipated, and therefore, we do not expect revenue to biotech clients to improve from first half levels.\nWe are laser-focused on initiatives to generate more revenue, contain costs and protect shareholder value. As I discussed earlier this year, we have already begun to enhance our commercial efforts. We are focused on optimizing our sales force to accelerate revenue growth by adjusting go-to-market strategies and being a flexible partner for our clients, focusing on selling across the entire portfolio and leveraging technology to enhance sales insights and identify selling opportunities earlier.\nOur digital strategy is also helping us to better connect with our clients including through our Apollo cloud-based platform to provide real-time access to scientific data and self-service tools for clients. To drive additional savings and preserve the bottom line, we will continue to aggressively manage our cost structure to ensure that capacity and head count are aligned with the current softer demand environment.\nWe have already consolidated several smaller sites and reduced staffing levels. These recent actions and additional actions that will be implemented by the end of the third quarter are expected to generate over $150 million of annualized cost savings, which will be fully realized in 2025.\nWe are also finalizing our strategy, focusing on further optimizing our global footprint, driving greater operating efficiency and leveraging our digital platform and global business services to further streamline processes.\nWe expect to implement the initial phases of this plan before the end of this year, and we'll provide a more comprehensive update in November, including the incremental savings that these initiatives will deliver.\nAs referenced in this morning's earnings release, we will also reinstate a stock repurchase program, and our Board recently approved a new stock repurchase authorization totaling $1 billion. We intend to reinstate stock repurchase activity before the end of the third quarter. Flavia will provide more details on this topic as well as an update on our capital priorities.\nI'd now like to provide you with additional details on our second quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the second quarter was $627.4 million, a decrease of 5% on an organic basis, driven by lower revenue in both the Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses.\nIn the Safety Assessment business, lower steady volume was partially offset by a small benefit from price increases. The overall business trends were relatively consistent with those that we have discussed in recent quarters with the exception of diverging demand trends between our global biopharmaceutical client base and small and mid-tier biotechs.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are beginning to see improvements in proposals and booking activity for biotech clients, but is meaningfully slowing for global biopharma clients. The combined effect has resulted in a net book-to-bill ratio that was similar to the last 5 quarters, but below 1x in the second quarter. Gross bookings also remained above 1x in the second quarter. And the cancellation rate was consistent with first quarter levels, which was below its peak, but still not back to targeted levels.\nAs a result of these trends, the DSA backlog decreased on a sequential basis to $2.16 billion at the end of the second quarter from $2.35 billion at the end of the first quarter.\nSince we do not expect these trends to improve during the second half of the year, as previously anticipated, and because we will likely be impacted by incremental spending pressures from our global biopharmaceutical client base, we have reduced our DSA revenue outlook to a high single-digit organic decline for the full year.\nIn the near term, we will ensure that our capacity both space and staffing are aligned with this lower expected level of demand.\nLooking beyond that, we will continue to speak with our clients and closely monitor for indications that clients are beginning to return their focus to their IND-enabling programs versus their recent focus on post-IND studies and for demand trends to stabilize or begin to improve across both the global and mid-tier client bases.\nThe DSA operating margin was 27.1% in the second quarter, a 50 basis point decrease from the second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of lower sales volume and moderated pricing, particularly in the Discovery Services business. The operating margin improved from the first quarter level, which was commensurate with sales volume, lower bonus accruals and additional cost savings generated by our restructuring efforts.\nRMS revenue was $206.4 million, a decrease of 3.9% on an organic basis over the second quarter of 2023. The RMS revenue decline was primarily driven by lower NHP revenue. As we mentioned last quarter, we expected the timing of NHP shipments to be a meaningful headwind to the second quarter RMS growth rate. Excluding the NHP impact, RMS revenue was essentially flat year-over-year as higher sales of small research models were offset by slightly lower revenue for research model services.\nFor the full year, we believe the market environment will remain stable overall. So we are reaffirming our RMS organic revenue growth outlook of flat to low single-digit growth.\nRevenue for small models continued to increase in all geographies, particularly in China and Europe. The resilience of the Research Models business reflects the fact that small models are essential low-cost tools for research, which also enhances our ability to continue to realize price increases globally. Our China business has been resilient despite the macroeconomic pressures in the country as the growth rate for small research models have strengthened driven primarily by share gains associated with our geographic expansions within China.\nResearch Model Services experienced a slight revenue decline in the second quarter in both GEMS and Insourcing Solutions. These trends largely reflect the overall biopharma demand environment. However, the benefits generated by clients that utilize our GEMS and IS solutions can help them overcome their budgetary pressures by driving efficiency.\nCRADL business model, while not unaffected by the demand environment, continues to resonate with clients who are looking for cost-effective solutions for their vivarium space requirements. There are pockets of softer demand, particularly in South San Francisco that have led to the consolidation of our CRADL capacity there. However, other biohubs continue to perform well.\nIn the second quarter, the RMS operating margin decreased by 330 basis points to 23.1%. The decline was primarily a result of the lower NHP revenue. The timing of NHP shipments from both Noveprim and in China can lead to quarterly revenue fluctuations. And since the sales of these large models are quite profitable, the timing of shipments can have a meaningful impact on the RMS margins on a quarterly basis. However, our view for the year hasn't changed and both the RMS and Manufacturing segments are expected to deliver operating margin expansion in 2024.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing Solutions segment was $192.3 million, an increase of 3.7% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of last year. Each of the segment's businesses contributed to the revenue growth. As anticipated, the Manufacturing growth rate was lower than the first quarter level because of a more challenging prior year comparison for the CDMO business. You may recall that we anniversaried the recovery of the CDMO business in the second quarter of last year. We expect the CDMO growth rate to reaccelerate in the second half of the year based on the current pipeline of new projects, particularly for cell therapy.\nAs a result, we expect Manufacturing organic revenue growth will be in the mid- to high single-digit range, a slight increase from our prior outlook. The competitive landscape is also undergoing a transition in certain manufacturing market sectors due to M&A or proposed geopolitical regulation, both of which should offer new opportunities to demonstrate the synergies of our comprehensive testing portfolio and win new business.\nThe CDMO business continues to perform well and client interest remains strong. The third client who utilizes our viral vector center of excellence in Maryland received commercial approval last month, and we are also regularly adding new projects across the various phases of clinical development.\nBooking activity continues to improve, and the CDMO business remains on track to deliver solid double-digit growth this year.\nRevenue in our manufacturing Quality Control Testing business, Biologics Testing and Microbial Solutions also continued to grow, rebounding from the more challenging market environment last year. Biologics Testing's performance was driven by its core testing activities, including cell banking and viral clearance. For Microbial Solutions, the primary driver of revenue growth was demand for our Endosafe testing cartridges. Clients have resumed their purchases of reagents and consumables as destocking activity have subsided.\nThe Manufacturing segment second quarter operating margin was 26.6%, demonstrated continued improvement with increases of 370 basis points year-over-year to 130 basis points sequentially. The improvement is largely a result of leverage from higher sales volume across each of the segment's businesses. We expect this trend will continue as the segment rebounds from 2023 and also due to the ongoing increase in the scale of our CDMO business.\nTo conclude, it is clear that our clients are in the midst of reassessing their budgets, reprioritizing their pipelines and managing their cost structures. However, our clients will continue to seek life-saving treatments for rare diseases and other unmet medical needs. In order to do so, they will, by necessity, reinvigorate investment in their early-stage R&D programs over time.\nTo emerge as an even stronger partner for our clients, we are working to actively manage our costs, initiate new and innovative ways to transform our business, protect shareholder value and enhance our clients' commercial experience to gain additional share.\nTo conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support.\nNow Flavia will provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance and 2024 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items.\nMany of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nSecond quarter 2024 organic revenue decreased at a 3.2% rate, in line with our outlook for the quarter of a low to mid-single-digit decline. However, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.80, which exceeded our prior outlook of mid-single-digit sequential earnings growth by approximately $0.40.\nThe majority of the earnings outperformance was driven by lower performance-based compensation expense. Continued growth in operating margin expansion in the Manufacturing segment also contributed.\nThe lower performance-based compensation expense was primarily related to adjustments to our bonus accruals and in light of the reduced outlook for the year.\nAs Jim discussed in detail, we have significantly lowered our guidance for the full year and now expect a revenue decline of 2.5% to 4.5% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% on an organic basis, driven primarily by a softer demand outlook in the second half of the year than previously anticipated for both small and midsized biotechnology and global pharmaceutical clients.\nWe expect DSA revenue to decline by approximately 10% organically in the second half compared to 6.9% year-over-year decline in the first half. DSA pricing is expected to turn slightly negative by the end of the year, but the largest driver of this change will be the softer demand.\nWe will not have time to offset all of the revenue shortfall with additional cost savings at this point in the year. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now in a range of $9.90 to $10.20 However, we are implementing additional restructuring initiatives to deliver further cost savings to partially offset the lower revenue and help preserve the bottom line, which will have a more meaningful impact in 2025 and beyond.\nAs Jim referenced, we are implementing additional initiatives to drive incremental cost savings to ensure that our cost structure aligns with the current demand environment. Restructuring initiatives are expected to generate over $150 million in annualized cost savings, representing nearly 5% of our operating costs, which is an increase from our prior target of approximately $70 million.\nThis updated target includes actions that were initiated last year through those already planned for the third quarter of this year.\nWe expect approximately $100 million of the savings to be realized in 2024.\nWe are also finalizing a multiyear strategy to optimize our global footprint and drive greater operating efficiency, which we believe will further our ability to protect operating margins and manage the business through this challenging environment.\nFurthermore, our Board recently approved a new stock repurchase authorization of $1 billion, which will add another option to allow us to strategically manage our capital allocation. We intend to commence stock repurchases under the new authorization before the end of the quarter. Our initial goal will be to offset annual share count dilution from equity awards, but we will regularly reevaluate the best uses of our capital.\nAs M&A activity has slowed, leverage has remained low at just above 2x and the capital intensity of our business has moderated in the current demand environment. These dynamics have enabled us to reassess our capital priorities.\nWe will also continue to repay debt and evaluate strategic acquisitions to enhance our service offerings as we believe a balanced approach to capital deployment will help maintain an optimal capital structure and maximize shareholder value.\nI'll now provide details on our segment outlook and some nonoperating items. By segment, we now expect DSA revenue to decline at a high single-digit rate on an organic basis, largely due to the softer demand environment than previously anticipated.\nThe outlook for the RMS and Manufacturing segments are essentially unchanged with RMS expected to report flat to low single-digit organic revenue growth and the Manufacturing segment expected to generate mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth, a slight increase from the outlook in May.\nFrom an operating margin perspective, we expect that this year's consolidated operating margin to be slightly below last year's level as the lower performance-based bonus expense and additional cost savings will nearly offset the revenue shortfall at the margin level in 2024.\nOn a segment basis, pressure in the DSA segment will offset expected margin expansion in both Manufacturing and RMS segments.\nUnallocated corporate costs totaled $50.5 million or 4.9% of revenue in the second quarter compared to 6.1% of revenue last year. This improvement was driven primarily by lower performance-based compensation accruals. For the full year, we expect unallocated corporate costs will be in the mid-5% range as a percent of revenue.\nThe second quarter tax rate was 21.1%, a decrease of 220 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a favorable geographic earnings mix and higher R&D tax credits. As a result of this favorability, we now expect our tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year.\nIn the second quarter, net interest expense was $29.8 million, which represented both a sequential and year-over-year decline. For the full year, we also expect total net interest expense will be lower than our prior outlook in the range of $118 million to $122 million. These reductions are primarily the result of shifting debt to lower interest rate geographies and continued debt repayment.\nAs a reminder, over 80% of our $2.4 billion debt at the end of the second quarter was at a fixed rate, including $500 million that is fixed until November via an interest rate swap.\nIn addition to lowering our interest expense, continued debt repayment resulted in gross and net leverage ratios of 2.2x at the end of the second quarter.\nFree cash flow remained strong with $154.1 million generated in the second quarter compared to $80.7 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower CapEx and working capital management.\nCapital expenditures were $39.5 million in the second quarter compared to $67.4 million last year, which reflected the ongoing moderation of our spend in the current demand environment and a disciplined focus on our capital investments. For the year, CapEx is expected to decline to approximately $250 million and our free cash flow will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million.\nA summary of our 2024 financial guidance can be found on Slide 36.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we expect both reported and organic revenue will decline at a mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to decline in the low double digits year-over-year as the impact of lower DSA demand will only be partially offset by the benefit of restructuring initiatives.\nThe year-over-year revenue growth rates in the RMS and Manufacturing segments are expected to rebound from the difficult comparisons in the second quarter, which were affected by the timing of NHP shipments in the RMS segment and the strong prior year comparison in the Manufacturing segment.\nIn conclusion, our critical focus at this time is continuing to execute our strategy, to rightsize the business and to turn around the financial performance. We believe that accomplishing these actions will position the company to gain market share and emerge from this period of softer demand as a leaner, more efficient scientific partner for our clients. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will provide comments on our first quarter of 2024.\nFollowing the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today. and can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call. I'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. I'd like to begin by providing an update on the overall market trends. There has been an increasing focus on market sentiment through the first 4 months of this year from clients, investors and other stakeholders. We still believe that the end market trends for our biopharmaceutical clients remain stable with signs that demand will begin to improve later this year, which is consistent with the outlook that we gave in February. One of these signs is an improvement in biotech funding after 2 years of tempered activity.\nBiotech funding increased significantly in the first quarter of 2024 to approximately $23 billion, the fourth highest quarter on record. These trends and the improving market sentiment have led to positive discussions with our clients, including at the Annual Society of Toxicology Conference in mid-March with clients specifically referencing the improving funding environment and optimism that this would lead to additional spending on the early-stage programs this year. We saw increased proposal activity in the first quarter. And while this is encouraging, and we have available capacity to start certain types of work relatively quickly, our outlook for the year remains appropriately measured.\nWe expect it will take time for additional funding and proposal activity to translate into new DSA bookings and revenue generation. Therefore, we continue to expect demand will improve later this year consistent with our initial outlook from February. Our first quarter financial results reflect a continuation of the demand trends and client spending patterns that we experienced at the end of last year, resulting in an organic revenue decline of 3.3% in the first quarter, in line with our outlook in February. The Manufacturing and RMS segments, both reported solid quarters, primarily driven by a rebound in order activity in the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing businesses as well as the timing of NHP shipments benefiting the RMS segment.\nAs expected, DSA revenue declined at a high single-digit rate organically, due in part to the challenging comparison to the strong organic growth rate of nearly 24% in the first quarter of last year. Demand trends are continuing to stabilize, reflecting the more positive sentiment in our end markets and reinforcing our financial outlook for the year. There has also been an increasing focus on the BIOSECURE Act this year. It is too early to determine the final outcome of this proposed legislation, both the content of the final bill, if passed, and the potential impact on the broader biopharmaceutical industry.\nWith approximately 95% of our revenue base in North America and Europe, we assume that the potential impact on Charles River would likely be a net positive should the bill be passed, but it's too early to determine the magnitude of the potential impact. The long-term industry fundamentals for drug development also remain firmly intact because the overwhelming demand to find life-saving treatments for rare diseases and many other unmet medical needs is unchanged.\nBiotechs are beginning to move back into favor in the capital markets and will lead the way while large pharma has consistently adapted to scientific advancements, the regulatory environment and a drive to be more efficient. Therefore, we firmly believe the industry's healthy growth prospects will reaccelerate. It's not a matter of if, but clients will reinvigorate their investments in early-stage R&D. As the leader in preclinical drug development, Charles River is a logical outsourcing partner to advance our clients' programs and enhance their speed to market. I will now provide highlights of our first quarter performance.\nWe reported revenue of $1.01 billion in the first quarter of 2024, a 1.7% decrease on a reported basis over last year. Organic revenue declined 3.3%, as solid performances from the Manufacturing and RMS segments were offset by the anticipated decline in DSA revenue. By client segment, revenue from small and midsized biotechs declined partially offset by higher revenue from global biopharmaceutical and academic clients. The operating margin was 18.5%, a decrease of 270 basis points year-over-year. The decline was principally driven by a lower DSA operating margin, reflecting the impact of lower sales volume as well as higher unallocated corporate costs. The restructuring initiatives that we implemented have not yet generated a full quarterly cost savings, which will occur in the second half of 2024.\nEarnings per share were $2.27 in the first quarter a decrease of 18.3% from the first quarter of last year. The decline reflects the lower revenue and operating margin as well as a higher tax rate. First quarter earnings per share exceeded our initial outlook in February due in part to a timing shift of NHP shipments, which moved into the first quarter and benefited RMS results. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. We continue to expect revenue growth of 1% to 4% on a reported basis and flat to 3% growth on an organic basis. Our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance remains in a range of $10.90 to $11.40. As I mentioned, there were some movements in the forecast between quarters, but our outlook for the year is essentially unchanged.\nI'd like to provide you with additional details on our first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the first quarter was $605.5 million, a decrease of 8.7% on an organic basis. Quarterly decline reflected a challenging comparison to the 23.6% growth rate last year as well as lower revenue in both Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses. Lower study volume in the Safety Assessment business was partially offset by a small benefit from pricing. We are modestly adjusting price [ on ] new proposals when appropriate to drive incremental volume.\nLooking at the broader demand trends, Safety Assessment, proposal activity and cancellations improved on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. This has not yet translated fully into improved bookings, but we are cautiously optimistic that these trends will lead to improved demand during the second half of the year. As we have noted in the past, the study mix routinely shifts back and forth over time. And we believe that new funding will enable our clients to shift their R&D focus back to IND-enabling studies from post-IND work that has been the focus for much of the past year.\nAs a reminder, there's a natural lag between the time that a client gets new funding and reaches out for a study proposal to when the client will book and subsequently begin the new work with us. The process can take a few quarters, which is factored into our expectation that demand will improve modestly later in the year. As a result of these trends, the DSA backlog decreased modestly on a sequential basis to $2.35 billion at the end of the first quarter from $2.45 billion at year-end. Gross bookings remained stable at above 1x, while the net book-to-bill ratio remained below 1x, but did improve slightly due to the lower cancellation rate in the first quarter.\nThe DSA operating margin was 23.5% in the first quarter, a 550 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decline reflected the challenging comparison to last year's outstanding operating margin performance. However, the first quarter operating margin was also below our longer-term targeted level in the mid- to high 20% range because lower sales volume and moderating price increases in Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses were unable to cover cost inflation.\nWe expect the DSA operating margin to move towards targeted levels as demand rebounds in the second half of the year. RMS revenue was $220.9 million, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis over the first quarter of 2023. The RMS segment benefited primarily from higher NHP revenue as well as from higher sales of small research models in all geographic regions due primarily to sustained pricing increases and from research model services. Revenue for small models increased in North America, Europe and China due primarily to pricing with growth in China leading all regions. While the growth rate in China has been compressed by the well-chronicled macroeconomic challenges in the country, we believe RMS demand has been less affected than other life science sector.\nWe believe the resilience of the research models business, both in China and the rest of the world comes from the fact that small models are essential, low-cost tools for research and without which research cannot proceed. From a services perspective, revenue increased modestly. [ In services ] Solutions, or IS, continued to generate higher revenue led by the cradle operations. And we also signed new contracts for our legacy IS [ Divarian ] management solutions. As we mentioned in February, the cradle growth rate is expected to accelerate during the year. we are monitoring the occupancy rates and new facility ramp in light of the biotech demand environment, which remains healthy overall.\nWe are balancing opening new sites in higher demand biohubs, like Boston, Cambridge and San Diego, with consolidation of capacity in more saturated regions like South San Francisco. The timing of NHP shipments to third-party clients also benefited first quarter results, both in China and from Noveprim, the Mauritius-based supplier in which we acquired a controlling interest late last year. These shipments accelerate into the first quarter. So although it would not change our RMS revenue outlook this year, it will affect the quarterly gating and pressure the second quarter RMS revenue growth rate.\nIn the first quarter, the RMS operating margin increased by 420 basis points to 27.6%. The robust improvement was primarily driven by the benefit from higher NHP revenue in the first quarter including the contribution from Noveprim, we do not expect the RMS operating margin will be sustained at this level for the full year as the gating of NHP shipments normalized but continue to expect margin improvement in the RMS and Manufacturing segments will enable us to achieve our outlook for the year. Revenue for the Manufacturing Solutions segment was $185.2 million, an increase of 10.4% on an organic basis compared to the first quarter last year. Each of these segments businesses contributed to the revenue growth, led by the CDMO business.\nWe were pleased that, as expected, revenue rebounded in both our Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses in the first quarter and biologics testing improved fourth quarter proposal volume led to the solid first quarter performance. Proposal and booking activity also increased meaningfully year-over-year in the first quarter, which confirmed the trends that emerged at the end of last year are continuing. Clients appear to be returning to the core testing activities, including cell banking and viral clearance, which were the services that slowed at the beginning of 2023.\nIn Microbial Solutions, we continue to see signs that destocking activity is winding down and believe it is now largely complete. Clients have resumed their purchases of reagents and consumables and spending on new instruments was reactivated with an increase of new orders, particularly for the Endosafe MCS endotoxin testing system. We believe that our comprehensive manufacturing quality control testing portfolio, which continues to resonate with clients and will help to reinvigorate the Manufacturing segment's growth rate in 2024. Our biologics testing and Microbial Solutions businesses are excellent examples of our focus on sustainable practices and the advancement of nonanimal alternative.\nIn biologics testing, we have launched an initiative with our clients to end the remaining in vivo testing use of viral safety and [ lot ] release testing, replacing it with in vitro methodologies. One of the alternative methods is next-generation sequencing testing that we are able to offer to clients through our partnership with PathoQuest. Our Microbial Solutions business also introduced the cartridge technology to our animal-free and to save Trillium endotoxin testing platform, which will promote Trillium's adoption to those clients who are looking to implement more sustainable testing practices. These are 2 examples of how we are already responsibly driving progress to reduce animal use and adopt alternative technologies, and I will provide additional details shortly on our new program to advance alternatives.\nThe CDMO business drove the segment's growth rate in the first quarter as a good for most of last year. generating solid double-digit growth. Client interest continues to be strong with new projects starting almost weekly across the various phases of clinical development. Cell therapy production activities for our 2 commercial clients are beginning to ramp up as well. The second quarter growth comparison will be more challenging for the CDMO business as we anniversary the recovery of the business in the second quarter of last year. But the sales funnel remains robust, and we continue to expect solid double-digit growth this year.\nManufacturing segment's first quarter operating margin was 25.3%, significant improvement from 13.7% in the first quarter of last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volume as each of the Manufacturing segment's businesses are regaining traction as well as the comparison to last year's lease impairment in the CDMO business.\nBefore turning the call over to Flavia, I'd like to provide an update on new initiatives that we are implementing to maintain our leadership position in nonclinical drug development. Last quarter, I discussed client-facing initiatives that we have implemented to become an even stronger scientific partner to our clients as well as actions to drive greater operational efficiencies. In April, we launched our AMAP, or AMAP program to drive positive change and better position the company for the future state of the industry, AMAP or the alternative message advancement project is aimed at initiatives dedicated to developing alternatives to reduce animal testing.\nWe intend to remain at the forefront of evaluating and implementing new and innovative technologies, including alternative technologies, to enhance the role that we play in helping our clients bring their life-saving therapies to market more efficiently. We anticipate these technologies will have greater impact on drug discovery as they already have begun with screening for lead compounds rather than a regulated safety testing process. Change will take time, which is why we intend to engage key stakeholders, including clients, partner organizations, thought leaders, policymakers and NGOs in the pursuit of scientific and technological innovation focused on advancing animal alternatives.\nWe had already been exploring alternatives to reduce animal testing through our initial investment of $200 million over the past 4 years. A portion of that investment enabled us to acquire a partner and internally develop more sustainable technologies, including the animal-free Endosafe Trillium endotoxin test, in our partnership with PathoQuest for next-gen sequencing that I just mentioned.\nOver the next 5 years, our goal is to invest an additional $300 million to fund similar initiatives under AMAP to enhance the development and utilization of alternative technologies. We intend to continue to lead the way in driving our industry to its next frontier. To conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support.\nNow Flavia will provide additional details on our first quarter financial performance and 2024 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nFirst quarter 2024 organic revenue decreased at a 3.3% rate, in line with the February outlook. However, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.27, which exceeded the outlook that we provided in February of at least $2. The primary drivers of the earnings outperformance were the acceleration of NHP shipments into the first quarter and a strong performance from the Manufacturing segment which delivered organic revenue growth of 10.4%.\nAs Jim mentioned, we continue to expect full year reported revenue growth of 1% to 4% and organic revenue growth of flat to a [ 3% ] increase as well as non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $10.90 to $11.40. We reaffirmed our annual revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance because the first quarter outperformance was largely driven by the timing of [indiscernible] shipments which only affects the quarterly gating in 2024 and not our full year outlook. Our segment outlook for 2024 revenue growth remains essentially unchanged as noted on Slide 30.\nWe also continue to expect consolidated operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points in 2024. We are diligently managing the cost structure and our focus on driving efficiency with restructuring initiatives expected to generate approximately $70 million of annualized cost savings or the upper end of our prior range. As anticipated, unallocated corporate costs were just above 6% of revenue at 6.2% compared to 4.3% of revenue in the first quarter of last year, contributing to the operating margin headwind in the first quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs will moderate from first quarter levels to just above 5% of revenue.\nThe first quarter tax rate was 23.3%, an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the impact from stock-based compensation. This was slightly better than our February outlook of a mid-20% tax rate because stock-based compensation was favorable due to a higher stock price during the quarter. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Net interest expense of $32.8 million in the first quarter was similar to both the prior year and fourth quarter levels as floating interest rates and debt balances were relatively stable.\nFor the year, we expect net interest expense to trend slightly favorable, which would put us at the low end of our prior outlook of $125 million to [ $130 million ]. As a reminder, nearly 3/4 of our $2.7 billion debt at the end of the first quarter was at a fixed rate. At the end of the first quarter, our gross leverage ratio was 2.4x, and our net leverage ratio was 2.3x. Free cash flow was $50.7 million in the first quarter compared to $2.5 million last year with a $28 million decrease in capital expenditures, driving much of the improvement. Capital expenditures were $79.1 million in the first quarter compared to $106.9 million last year due primarily to moderating capacity expansions to match current demand. For the year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $440 million and CapEx is expected to be approximately $300 million. A summary of our 2024 financial guidance can be found on Slide 35.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect reported and organic revenue will decline at a low to mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. Our second quarter expectations include a modest sequential increase in DSA revenue as trends begin to improve. The second quarter revenue growth rates for both the RMS and Manufacturing segments are expected to be constrained by the timing of NHP shipments in RMS and the anniversary of last year's CDMO growth rebound in the Manufacturing segment. Earnings per share are expected to improve from the first quarter level with an outlook of mid-single-digit sequential earnings growth over the $2.27 reported in the first quarter.\nWe expect the tax rate and interest expense will remain relatively stable from the first quarter levels, and the operating margin will remain somewhat constrained until the second half of the year when we recognize the full benefit from the cost savings and the revenue growth rate reaccelerates to cover more of the annual cost inflation. In conclusion, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for the year. Demand for our unique nonclinical portfolio is resilient, and we remain focused on executing our strategy, driving efficiency and gaining market share. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings and 2024 Guidance Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the fourth quarter of '23 as well as our financial guidance for 2024.\nFollowing the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with [indiscernible] -- today's remarks, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call and can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through the next quarter's conference call. I'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. The stability and resilience of Charles River's business model were very clear in 2023, although demand trends moderated in the broader life sciences sector, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6.5% and earnings per share of $10.67, both of which were in the upper half of the original guidance ranges that we provided last February. We accomplished this despite the pipeline reprioritization activity and more conscious spending by many of our biopharmaceutical clients and also by successfully mitigating the impact of the NHP supply disruption in the United States.\nWe are anticipating that constrained client spending will persist into 2024, but that demand will stabilize during the year. At the top end of our financial guidance range, we expect that demand trends will begin to modestly improve later this year. These trends are expected to result in organic revenue that is flat to 3% growth in 2024. Since providing a high-level outlook at our Investor Day in September, we have further derisked our 2024 financial plan and believe our current outlook is appropriately balanced as cancellations remained elevated and backlog continued to moderately decline in our Safety Assessment business during the fourth quarter of last year.\nOur belief that the macroeconomic environment will stabilize this year is supported by early external indicators that improvement will come, including several successful biotech IPOs in January providing early signs that the capital markets should reopen and biotech funding will improve. Our internal indicators also suggest that demand trends may be beginning to stabilize in certain businesses including signs of the client destocking activity in Microbial Solutions is easing and increased proposal activity in biologics testing business in the fourth quarter. We believe the market environment is transitory. The long-term industry fundamentals for drug development remain firmly intact because the overwhelming need to find life-saving treatments for rare diseases and many other unmet medical needs is unchanged. Biotech will again move into favor in the capital markets and will lead the way using advanced modalities and new technologies to drive innovation.\nLarge pharma has consistently adapted to scientific advancements the regulatory environment and a drive to be more efficient. Therefore, we anticipate little change with regard to the industry's healthy long-term growth prospects and continued investments in R&D. In today's market environment, we will not wait for client spending patterns to improve. We are proactively and continuously engaged in actions to streamline our organization, to drive productivity, enhance our speed and responsiveness and become an even stronger scientific partner to our clients. We are doing this by continuing to focus our initiatives to win additional market share in new outsourcing opportunities across all 3 business segments. This includes enhanced commercial efforts through optimizing our sales force to accelerate revenue growth by adjusting go-to-market strategies, focusing on selling across our entire portfolio and leveraging technology to enhance sales insights and identify earlier selling opportunities.\nOur digital strategy is helping us to better connect with our clients including through our Apollo cloud-based platform to provide real-time access to scientific data and self-service tools for clients. We also have a culture of continuous improvement in Charles River that enables us to drive operational efficiencies and cost-saving actions to proactively manage our cost structure and to become an even more compelling partner for our clients for the longer term. Flavia will outline the cost savings from our restructuring initiatives shortly. Overall, our successful execution in these areas will enable us to capitalize on new business opportunities as they emerge while delivering operating margin improvement in 2024 and beyond.\nBefore I provide more details on our 2024 outlook, let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. We reported revenue of $1.01 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 3.5% decline on an organic basis over the previous year. The decrease was driven primarily by a mid-single-digit decrease in the DSA segment. As we have regularly mentioned, the year-over-year DSA growth rate was affected by a challenging comparison to the 26.5% and growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. As has been the trend throughout 2023, sales to the global biopharmaceutical clients segment outperformed small and midsized biotechs again in the fourth quarter. For 2023, we were pleased to report revenue of $4.13 billion with an organic revenue increase of 6.5%. The top line performance was driven by another solid year in our Safety Assessment business as well as healthy growth in the RMS segment.\nThe operating margin decreased 130 basis points year-over-year to 19.1% in the fourth quarter, principally driven by higher unallocated corporate costs due in part to a meaningful increase in health and fringe-related expenses. The DSA operating margin also contributed with a small year-over-year decline driven by lower sales volume in the Discovery business. For the full year, the operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 20.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by the manufacturing and RMS segments as well as higher unallocated corporate costs. Earnings per share were $2.46 in the fourth quarter a decrease of 17.4% from $2.98 in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition to the lower revenue and operating margin, a higher tax rate as well as the 53rd week in 2022 and in the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business in the fourth quarter of 2022 were earnings headwinds.\nThe 2023 earnings per share declined by 4% to $10.67 and due primarily to the nonoperating headwinds, including significantly higher interest expense. In total, interest expense, tax and the Avian divestiture reduced 2023 earnings per share by over $1. With respect to 2024, we believe our outlook is appropriately balanced. Demand from many of our large biopharmaceutical clients is expected to be stable while small and mid-sized biotechnology clients may continue to spend cautiously as they endeavor to extend the cash runway until clear indications of an improving funding environment emerge. At the same time, we expect both of these client segments to continue to increasingly utilize strategic outsourcing to gain efficiencies and cost effectiveness in the drug development programs. As I mentioned earlier, organic revenue in 2024 is expected to be in a range from flat to 3% growth.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range from $10.90 to $11 and $0.40, including at least $0.30 of earnings accretion from the November increase in our ownership stake in Noveprim , our NHP supplier in [indiscernible] . The range represents earnings per share growth of approximately 2% to 7%, with earnings growth expected to exceed revenue growth due primarily to operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points this year. I'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our expectations for 2024, beginning with the DSA segment. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $625.8 million, a decrease of 6% on an organic basis. The quarterly decline reflected the difficult comparison to the 26.5% growth rate last year as well as a meaningful decline in the Discovery Services revenue in the fourth quarter. Safety Assessment revenue also decreased by the lower rate. In the Safety Assessment business, the elevated cancellations throughout 2023, and slippage had a greater impact on the fourth quarter with work been canceled or stock dates moved out of the fourth quarter and into 2024. For the year, DSA revenue increased 7.9% on an organic basis which met our segment outlook due to another solid year in the Safety Assessment business. As anticipated, the backlog coverage enabled us to achieve our DSA financial outlook of high single-digit organic revenue growth in 2023. At year-end, DSA backlog modestly declined to $2.45 billion from $2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Cancellation rate increased from third quarter levels, resulting in a net book-to-bill that remained relatively stable to below 1x. However, the net will book-to-bill has moved within a similar range throughout each quarter of 2023.\nWith gross bookings remaining above 1x at the end of the fourth quarter, we expect demand KPIs to improve modestly once the cancellation rates subside, which is one of the assumptions behind our DSA outlook. We expect flat to low single-digit organic revenue growth in the DSA segment in 2024. The first quarter will exhibit a trend similar to the fourth quarter of 2023 due in part to the normal seasonal lag of study starts at the beginning of the year. We expect study volume to improve thereafter, but the first half growth rate will be lower before the easier year-over-year growth comparison and improving demand KPIs benefit the second half DSA growth rate. Another assumption is that DSA revenue growth will be principally driven by modest price increases in 2024. This includes a $15 million to $35 million impact from NHP pricing, which reflects a significantly lower price increase than in recent years.\nOne of the reasons that we are able to navigate a volatile NHP pricing environment that saw long-standing, high-quality NHP supply relationships, which give us an important competitive advantage in the preclinical sector. the November acquisition of an additional 41% stake in Noveprim for approximately $145 to a 90% controlling interest firmly supports our stated NHP supply strategy of enhancing safeguards and diversifying our NHP supply through increased ownership and operational control. Noveprim is reported as part of our DSA segment for NHPs vertically integrated into our safety assessment supply chain in the RMS segment for NHP sold to third-party clients. Flavia will provide more details on the financial impact of Noveprim which is now consolidated in our financial results. As we often comment, we are also deeply committed to initiatives to modify and reduce animal use, which are embedded in our 4 or comparatives of replacement reduction, refinement and responsibility.\nWe intend to remain the leader in regulatory required preclinical development services through both enhanced efforts to secure and safeguard our supply chain and also by champion methodologies to reduce MOUs, including alternative technologies. Over the last 4 years, we have invested approximately $200 million in these technologies, principally through our strategic partnership activities to add capabilities from AI to next-generation sequencing as well as through investments in our digital enterprise and our animal-free and to safe [ Trillium ] testing platform. Discovery Services had a challenging year and saw a meaningful revenue decline in the fourth quarter across all client segments. Discovery proposal volume remained low throughout the year and clients' decision-making time lines for new projects remained extended. Despite these near-term challenges, Discovery Services remain a critical component of our end-to-end early-stage portfolio as we are able to partner with clients and often establish a relationship with them earlier in their life cycle whether for a single project or an integrated program that are able to work flexibly by providing clients with cutting-edge capabilities to discover the [ novel ] therapeutics. As we turn the page to 2024, we are cautiously optimistic that budget replenishment in the new year will lead to healthier demand trends but have forecast the business to be essentially flat in 2024.\nThe DSA operating margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, a 30 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the revenue decline in the Discovery Services business. For the year, operating margin increased by 220 basis points to 27.5% as a result of operating leverage associated with higher revenue and favorable mix in the Safety Assessment business. RMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $195.8 million, a decrease of 0.4% on an organic basis. For the year, RMS organic revenue growth was 5.9%. Demand for small research models across all client segments slowed considerably in the fourth quarter, particularly in North America and Europe. Sales of small models were the principal headwind to fourth quarter growth as well as continued softness in the Cell Solutions business. These headwinds were largely offset by healthy revenue growth in China for both small models and NHPs in the fourth quarter despite the numerous reports of a difficult demand environment for the life science sectors within the country.\nFor 2024, we expect RMS organic revenue will be flat to low single-digit growth, the current demand environment will likely limit unit volume growth this year in the research model business in North America and Europe. So we expect to drive most of the growth from a modest price increase. In China, we expect continued healthy demand for small models and associated services, albeit tempered from the robust historical double-digit growth rates in the region. We expect NHP revenue in China to decline in 2024 due primarily to lower pricing in the region. Research model services are positioned to be a notable contributor to revenue growth from 2024. We are expanding our GEMS capacity in certain regions to accommodate our clients' increasing requirements for our support of their complex research and maintenance of the genetically modified model colonies. In addition, CRADL, the largest growth drivers for RMS in recent years is expected to deliver a solid top line performance in 2024, with growth accelerating in the second half of the year due in part to the ramp-up of several new CRADL sites.\nClients are continuing to adopt a flexible model to access Siberian space without having to invest in internal infrastructure, which provides a powerful value proposition to biotech clients in particular, who are trying to conserve capital. The RMS operating margin increased by 40 basis points year-over-year to 23.1% in the fourth quarter, but decreased by 220 basis points to 23% and in 2023. The 1 month contribution from Noveprim as well as increased shipments of NHPs within China, with the principal contributors to the fourth quarter margin improvement partially offset by lower sales volume in the small models business. As I mentioned, Noveprim sale of NHPs to third-party external clients has been included in the RMS segment. which is expected to drive meaningful margin improvement in the RMS segment in 2024. Manufacturing Solutions revenue was $191.9 million for the fourth quarter, growth rate of 2.3% on an organic basis and the full year organic growth rate was 2%. The CDMO business drove the segment growth rate with solid double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.\nInitiatives that we implemented to improve the performance of our CDMO business have proven successful in 2023. We believe the business is now well positioned competitively with its centers of excellence for cell therapies, viral vectors and plasmids and that investments made over the past 2 years have enhanced the commercial readiness of our operations. The enhancements of the business have been well received and are in positive feedback from clients. We are generating additional client interest that has undoubtedly been initiated by our announcement in December at our metasite received U.S. and EU approval to manufacture [ Casey ] by VERTEX, the first gene-edited cell therapy targeting severe sickle cell disease. We are very pleased with our relationship and believe commercial relationships like this will continue to drive new client inquiries going forward. Our Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses both reported modest revenue declines in the fourth quarter. Microbial Solutions did experience a modest increase in the year-end client order activity is normally occurs, but not to the extent that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, and there was a significant budget flush.\nWe are now seeing positive signs of client destocking activity is starting to wind down and both large biopharmaceutical and CDMO clients as the number of large clients recently resumed their order activity for reagents and consumables. In addition, we're now seeing confirmed ship dates for instruments, including the Endosafe Nexus 200 automated system that were delayed in 2023. As we previously mentioned, the biologics testing business had a difficult year due to tighter client spending in its end markets. However, we saw an increase in client proposal activity in the fourth quarter, which was the first quarterly increase in 2023. First quarter sample volumes for the Biologics Testing business are always seasonally soft coming out of the holidays. But we believe both biologics testing and microbial solutions will see improving trends over the course of the year and our position to generate modest revenue growth in 2024.\nIn total, we expect low to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the Manufacturing segment this year. The Manufacturing segment's operating margin increased slightly to 25.4% in the fourth quarter that declined by 700 basis points for the year to 21.8%, while the operating margin decline in each of the Manufacturing segment's business units in 2023, the CDMO business was the most meaningful headwind throughout the year. However, as project volumes continue to improve and enhance the business' margin profile, we expect significant improvement this year, contributing to meaningful segment operating margin improvement in 2024. As we mentioned at Investor Day in September, we expect the manufacturing segment will drive the improvement towards the company's margin expansion targets over the next 3 years, and the CDMO business is a key component of that goal.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to congratulate Bill Barbo on a remarkable 42-year career at Charles River. As we announced previously, Bill will retire as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; at the end of 2024. Bill's career began with a lot of science, working as an animal care intern before joining the company as a full-time research scientist. We continue to assume positions of increasing responsibility eventually moving into our commercial organization. During his time at Charles River we've built led numerous initiatives, which contributed to our market-leading position and his comprehensive knowledge of our portfolio has made him an indispensable leader of our commercial organization. Bill has dedicated his career to ensuring we deliver on our purpose and has truly embraced our values. I greatly appreciated builds contributions and partnerships over the last 42 years and wish him all the best in his next chapter.\nFor many years, Bill has been working with Kristen Eisenhauer, a Senior Vice President responsible for all client services and sales. Kristen has now assumed the Chief Commercial Officer role, so we are fortunate to have a successor in place and anticipate a seamless transition. Thanks again, Bill, and congratulations to Kristen. In addition to Bill's retirement, Senior Vice President, Chris evolve, has now assumed responsibility for the Microbial Solutions business and will now be responsible for our entire Manufacturing Solutions segment. This aligns the operational leadership for our CGMP certified businesses under Kirsten, as she has effectively led our biologics testing and CDMO operations for a number of years.\nTo close, we were pleased with our solid performance in 2023. Our long-term prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion remain unchanged from the targets we provided at Investor Day including averaging 6% to 8% organic revenue growth and approximately 150 basis points of cumulative operating margin improvement through 2026. Charles River is positioned exquisitely to meet the evolving needs of our clients and will capitalize on the opportunities that emerge in today's business environment as the demand trends stabilize and eventually improve. We are taking action to gain additional market share to enhance commercial initiatives and by strengthening our leading nonclinical portfolio by focusing on innovation, including adding cutting-edge technologies from AI to next-generation sequencing. We are also committed to driving efficiency and appropriately managing our cost structure without sacrificing the flexibility to respond to a changing industry and client requirements, and we have stabilized and continue to secure our supply chain, including through the acquisition of Noveprim.\nWe will continue to lead and to proactively manage the business through this dynamic market environment as well as to deliver value to our shareholders. To conclude, I would like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and for our clients and shareholders for their support. Now I'd like Flavia to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2024 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments, gains on the avian divestiture and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022.\nOur fourth quarter 2023 revenue and earnings per share were in line with our expectations and our prior guidance ranges and reflected the continuation of a cautious biopharmaceutical and market demand environment, which we expect will persist into 2024. Therefore, we expect reported revenue growth of 1% to 4% organic revenue that will be flat to 3% growth in 2024. Higher revenue and moderate margin improvement are expected to drive non-GAAP earnings per share to a range of $10.90 to $11.40 this year, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 2% to 7%. Our guidance also assumes that the tax rate is less of a headwind to earnings growth than in the prior year, and that interest expense will be slightly below 2023. I'll provide more detail on the nonoperating items a bit later.\nAs Jim mentioned, in November, we acquired an additional 41% equity stake in Noveprim, a high-quality supplier of NHPs in Mauritius. Noveprim has been a long time supplier to Charles River, and we made our first equity investment in 2022, acquiring a 49% stake. Now that we own a 90% controlling interest, we'll consolidate Noveprim's operations into our financial results. The acquisition is expected to be the primary contributor of our operating margin improvement in 2024 and add at least $0.30 to non-GAAP earnings per share. The majority of the financial contribution this year will be derived from NHB sold to third-party clients, which will be included in the RMS segment. We expect Noveprim will generate $40 million to $50 million of third-party revenue for the full year 2024, which will not impact organic revenue growth until we anniversary the transaction in late November.\nNHPs that will be utilized in regulatory required studies will be included in the DSA segment. The transaction will be a small benefit to our DSA financial results as we will now be sourcing these models internally instead of a third-party supplier. With regard to the quarterly dating of our 2024 outlook, as we have said many times, our business isn't linear and its quarterly performance can fluctuate based on mix, the status of clients' programs, the timing of NHB shipments and other related factors. We expect the second half of 2024 will be stronger for both year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin than the first half, due in part to the challenging growth comparisons in the first half of 2023. We expect organic revenue will decrease at a low to mid-single-digit rate in the first half, followed by a second half increase at a mid- to high single-digit rate.\nI will now provide additional details on our 2024 outlook, starting with our reportable segments. The RMS segment is expected to generate flat to low single-digit organic revenue growth based on modest growth for research models driven principally by price as well as accelerating growth in the services business with the ramp of new cradle facilities in the second half. The DSA segment is also expected to generate flat to low single-digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation that early stage demand trends will stabilize during the first half of the year and begin to improve later in the year. The Manufacturing segment is expected to achieve low to mid-single-digit growth, primarily driven by the CDMO business as well as modest revenue growth in the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing businesses.\nIn 2023, the operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 20.3%. This was caused by higher unallocated corporate costs that reduced the consolidated operating margin by 30 basis points, which I'll discuss shortly and the moderating domain environment during the year, which particularly impacted the RMS and Biologics Testing businesses. The manufacturing margin was also impacted by higher costs in the CDMO business necessary to prepare for regulatory audits and commercial readiness as well as a lease impairment in the first quarter of 2023. We implemented cost-saving actions in 2023 and 2024 to manage our cost structure and align it with the current demand environment, but it takes time for the savings to ramp. These restructuring initiatives will generate approximately $60 million to $70 million in annualized cost savings. Despite the slower top line growth, we expect to generate operating margin improvement of at least 50 basis points.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this improvement will primarily be generated by Noveprim. The balance of the improvement will be derived from continued efforts to manage costs and drive efficiency. On a segment basis, we expect meaningful operating margin improvement from the RMS and Manufacturing segments. Noveprim is expected to contribute at least 200 basis points to the RMS margin. In the manufacturing segment, we expect the profitability of each business unit will improve commensurate with sales volume, but expect the CDMO business will be the largest contributor as it grows in scale and adds commercial revenue and as costs related to regulatory audit preparation and commercial readiness moderate. The DSA operating margin is expected to be slightly below the 2023 level. We expect unallocated corporate expenses in 2024 to be similar to the 2023 level at just above 5% of total revenue.\nThe 30 basis point increase in 2023 to 5.3% was primarily attributable to continued investments in our digital strategy as well as higher health and fringe-related costs, which was the primary driver of the fourth quarter increase. The non-GAAP tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, an increase from 22.1% in 2023. The anticipated increase in the tax rate is principally due to the impact related to stock-based compensation as well as the geographic mix of revenue. In addition, we do not expect discrete tax benefits, which benefited 2023 to repeat. The headwind from stock-based compensation will cause the first quarter tax rate to be in the mid-20% range because of the more pronounced impact on the tax rate from the timing of vesting of equity awards at current stock price levels. Total adjusted net interest expense in 2024 is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, compared to $131.5 million last year. The decrease will be primarily driven by debt repayment as well as anticipated lower variable interest rates later in 2024.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, we had outstanding debt of $2.65 billion compared to $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. The sequential increase reflected borrowing to fund the Noveprim acquisition. At the end of the fourth quarter, approximately 75% of our $2.65 billion in outstanding debt was at a fixed interest rate. Our gross leverage ratio was 2.3x, and our net leverage ratio was 2.2x at the end of the fourth quarter. For 2024, we expect free cash flow will be in a range of $400 million to $440 million, representing a meaningful increase over $365 million in 2023. This increase will be driven by our earnings growth as well as our continued focus on working capital management. In addition, capital expenditures are expected to decline both on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue. CapEx for 2024 is expected to be approximately $300 million or about 7% of total revenue, down from $318.5 million or 7.7% of revenue in 2023. This outlook is in line with our long-term target level of 7% to 8% of revenue for CapEx and reflects our disciplined approach to aligning capacity and capital investments with market demand.\nA summary of our 2024 financial guidance, including Noveprim can be found on Slide 38. With regard to the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue will decline in a low to mid-single-digit range on a reported basis and declined in a mid-single-digit range on an organic basis as we expect demand trends will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2023. As a reminder, despite the stronger first quarter in 2023, there is typically a seasonal impact in safety assessment, reflecting fewer study starts at the beginning of the year. The Biologics Testing business is also impacted by seasonally lower sample volumes in the first quarter. From an earnings perspective, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of at least $2 in the first quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by a lower operating margin due in part to seasonal business trends. Unallocated corporate costs will also remain above 6% of revenue in the first quarter and similar to the fourth quarter level. A challenging comparison to the robust DSA operating margin in the first quarter of last year also impacts the year-over-year comparison.\nAs I mentioned, we expect a meaningfully higher tax rate in the mid-20% range, reflecting a headwind from stock-based compensation. We do expect revenue and operating margin will improve sequentially after the first quarter as we move beyond the seasonal trends at the beginning of the year, and market demand improves marginally as the year progresses. In closing, despite the ongoing cautious biopharma spending environment, our business continues to be resilient, and we remain confident in the long-term health of the industry. Our solid 2023 performance reflected our ability to manage the challenges in the marketplace while continuing to focus on making disciplined investments to support our businesses and managing costs to capture efficiencies.\nAlthough 2024 organic revenue growth is forecasted to be below our long-term targets, we remain confident in our Investor Day targets of averaging 6% to 8% organic revenue growth through 2026 and delivering meaningful margin expansion, which is supported by the sustained long-term fundamentals for drug development and our position as an industry leader. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations.Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.\nThis morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the third quarter of 2023. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's website, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may materially differ from those indicated.\nDuring the conference call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of the core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. We reported third quarter organic revenue growth of 4.1% and earnings per share of $2.72, both of which exceeded our prior outlook. As anticipated, our growth rates declined from first half levels, reflecting the difficult comps from last year and the moderating demand that is affecting our businesses this year.\nLooking at the biopharmaceutical end market environment, we believe certain demand trends slowed -- showed some early positive signs, but clients also remain cautious with their spending. Biopharmaceutical clients are continuing to reprioritize their pipelines and in some cases, conserve cash or streamline their cost structures. This has led to a meaningful impact on some of our businesses this year, including Discovery Services and our Manufacturing segment and began to have a more discernible impact on the RMS business in the third quarter. We believe the current client spending patterns will persist in the near term. However, we are also seeing some early encouraging signs starting to emerge, which support our belief that the demand environment will stabilize.\nIn the Safety Assessment business, we were pleased to see sequential improvement in both the study cancellation rate and the net book-to-bill ratio in the third quarter. These favorable trends are supported by external indicators, including a stable biotech funding environment. The third quarter was the second consecutive quarterly increase in biotech funding on a trailing 12-month basis, led by venture capital investments.\nI will now provide highlights of our third quarter performance. We reported revenue of $1.03 billion in the third quarter of 2023, a 3.8% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 4.1% was driven by all three business segments, led by a mid-single-digit increase in the DSA segment. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter growth rate was affected by a difficult comparison to last year, that included organic growth of 15.3% in the third quarter of 2022. By client segment, third quarter revenue growth was driven by solid demand from global biopharma clients and academic institutions.\nAs has been the case throughout the year, the growth rate for small and midsized biotech slowed as these clients are being more selective with their spending. Growth of biotech clients last year also outpaced all other client segments, driving the particularly difficult comparison in the second half of the year.\nThe operating margin was 20.5%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year. The slight improvement was driven primarily by the DSA segment as well as lower unallocated corporate costs. These improvements were largely offset by margin pressure in both the RMS and Manufacturing segments.\nEarnings per share were $2.72 in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% from the third quarter of last year. This exceeded our prior outlook, due primarily to the top line outperformance. In addition, the year-over-year headwind from interest expense is beginning to dissipate.\nWe have tightened our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance ranges for 2023 as we move into the final quarter of the year. We are narrowing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.50 to $10.70, which raises the bottom end and trims the top end of our prior range by $0.20 per share, respectively. The guidance update is primarily due to shifts in the gating of our forecast between quarters and the favorable impact of lower third quarter cancellations in the Safety Assessment business being largely offset by a reduced outlook for our Manufacturing Solutions segment in the fourth quarter.\nI'd like to provide you with additional details on our third quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the third quarter was $664 million, an increase of 5.3% on an organic basis. Safety Assessment business continued to drive DSA revenue growth, with contributions from base pricing and higher study volume, driven by non-NHP-related work and post-IND studies. NHP pricing was a modest benefit to the growth rate. But as I will discuss shortly, NHP study volume declined year-over-year.\nDiscovery Services remained an integral component of our end-to-end early-stage portfolio because it enables us to forge relationships with clients at earlier stages of the R&D process. However, the business continues to be impacted by the overall biopharma demand environment as clients focus on post-IND work and getting their drugs to the clinic to the detriment of discovery spending.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we saw some early signs of more favorable demand trends in the third quarter for our Safety Assessment business. The cancellation rate improved sequentially and was at the lowest level since the second quarter of 2022. The net book-to-bill ratio also improved sequentially, but remained below 1x. As a result, the DSA backlog declined in the third quarter to $2.6 billion from $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nHowever, as the lower cancellation suggests clients appear to be moving further along in their pipeline reprioritization processes, which we believe will lead to a higher quality and more reliable book of business. With the net book-to-bill remaining below 1x, we believe the current demand trends will persist in the near term, including in the fourth quarter, which, as a reminder, already faces a difficult comparison to DSA organic growth of 26.5% reported last year.\nOverall, we believe stabilizing demand trends and significant backlog coverage will enable us to achieve our financial targets, including high single-digit DSA organic revenue growth for 2023, which is above our prior outlook for the segment.\nThe DSA operating margin was 27.2% in the third quarter, a 100-basis-point increase from the third quarter of 2022. The increase continued to be driven by operating leverage associated with higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business.\nBefore moving on to RMS, I'd like to comment on our NHP-related study work. At our Investor Day in September, we provided some information around the benefit from NHP pricing on our DSA revenue growth rates. We believe that additional information would be useful for investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the impact of NHP pricing and NHP-related safety assessment studies on our business.\nOver a 3-year period, ending in 2023, NHP pricing is expected to benefit DSA revenue growth by a total of just $230 million or approximately 30% of our total DSA revenue growth since 2020. Without the impact of NHP pricing, DSA revenue would still have increased at a high single-digit growth CAGR since 2020. In total, NHP Safety Assessment study revenue, which includes both services and the embedded NHP revenue, is expected to represent approximately 30% of DSA segment revenue in both 2022 and 2023.\nNHP pricing has rapidly escalated since 2020 due to both NHP supply constraints and the continued increase of biologic drugs in development. Supply constraints began in China around the pandemic and intensified last year due to the Cambodian NHP supply situation in the U.S. This has caused NHP pricing to increase by approximately $20,000 per model in aggregate since 2020.\nIn 2023, we expect to utilize approximately 11,400 NHPs in safety assessment studies worldwide. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% from over 15,000 in the prior year, principally driven by the current level of biopharmaceutical demand and our clients' focus on their post-IND safety assessment work, which generates higher service revenue per model due to the longer-term nature of these studies, with fewer NHPs are used to generate that service revenue.\nA long-standing strategic imperative of the company is responsible animal use, which includes modifying or reducing animal usage. Responsible animal use is firmly embedded in our commitment to animal welfare and the 4R principles. And its adoption accelerated this year as a result of the NHP supply constraints.\nOne example of our progress is the introduction of virtual control groups for toxicology studies. Virtual control groups, or VCGs, replaced the animals and control groups with existing randomized data sets and statistical evaluations. It will take some time to adopt, but we are having active discussions with our clients about VCGs.\nAs many of you are aware, we have committed to providing additional disclosure on NHP sourcing and a comprehensive update on our NHP strategic initiatives in early 2024. The timing of this strategic update will be ideal as we recognize the industry is changing, and these shifts are causing disruptive technologies to emerge and societal needs to evolve.\nWith the industry at an inflection point, we will reinforce our critical role in preclinical drug development and maintain our leadership position. We will do this by leading with science, remaining committed to our essential mission of creating healthier lives and ensuring patient safety and by consistently challenging ourselves to raise the bar.\nAnd as we look to the future, we will be focused on ensuring a sustainable supply chain, particularly for NHPs. And we'll also pursue a longer-term strategy to lead the industry in adopting animal alternatives. Our team is diligently working to continue to enhance our processes and key initiatives in these areas. We've already made several investments in non-animal technologies, ranging from our Endosafe Trillium launch this summer for endotoxin detection testing, to our technology partnerships with Valo for Discovery AI, PathoQuest for next-gen sequencing for in vitro viral study safety testing and Cypre for 3D tumor modeling. We look forward to sharing our NHP strategic update in early 2024.\nRMS revenue was $186.8 million, an increase of 3.2% on an organic basis over the third quarter of 2022. This is below the year-to-date high single-digit revenue growth rate for two primary reasons: slower demand from mid-tier clients, including biotechs and CROs; and the timing of NHP shipments within China as we anticipated last quarter.\nThe timing of NHP shipments within China is transitory. We expect NHP revenue in China will improve in the fourth quarter, although some shipments will slip out of 2023. For the year, we expect RMS organic revenue growth will be in the mid- to high single-digit range.\nIn the third quarter, we generated revenue growth in our small research models business and in the services business. Our client segment demand from global biopharma clients and academic institutions remain robust and drove RMS revenue growth. But as I mentioned, this was offset by mid-tier clients affected by the broader biopharma demand environment as well as by softer demand from government accounts. Small molecules revenue increased across all geographic regions, including China, principally driven by price.\nOur services business continued to report healthy growth, led by in-sourcing solutions and our CRADL operations. Our CRADL sites, or our flexible vivarium rental space, remain well utilized overall and continue to generate significant year-over-year revenue growth.\nIn the third quarter, the RMS operating margin decreased by 460 basis points to 18.9%. The significant decline was driven by the mix of business, which favored academic clients in our Insourcing Solutions business as well as the timing of NHP shipments within China. We expect the RMS operating margin will rebound in the fourth quarter due in part to the timing of the China NHP shipments.\nIn addition, as we mentioned at Investor Day, we are reviewing the profitability of certain Insourcing Solutions contracts, which should benefit the RMS operating margin in the future. Revenue for the Manufacturing Solutions segment was $175.7 million, an increase of 0.9% on an organic basis compared to the third quarter of last year. The segment is experiencing softness across the broader end markets, which we attribute to a post-COVID slowdown from biopharma manufacturers, CDMOs and their suppliers. These market conditions started to more noticeably impact the Microbial Solutions business in the third quarter.\nClients, particularly CDMOs, are cutting costs as part of their COVID destocking efforts and reducing testing volumes and fewer programs advanced into the clinic, but these clients must continue to manufacture commercial products. So we believe the long-term growth trends for our Manufacturing segment will reemerge after a period of rightsize.\nFor Microbial Solutions, the global biopharma demand environment is affecting our Endosafe endotoxin testing product line as clients reduce both testing volumes and investments in new instruments. This includes China, where we have a small microbial operation and like many life science instrumentation companies, have seen a decline in client demand.\nHowever, other areas of the business, such as Accugenix microbial identification services, continued to perform well. Third quarter trends in biologics testing were similar to those experienced since the beginning of the year. The sector continued to be challenged by the tighter funding environment, which is resulting in clients reprioritizing projects and reducing demand for services that can be conducted at various times during the development process, including viral clearance and cell banking.\nWhile not immune to the end market challenges, in the other manufacturing businesses, with cell and gene therapy, CDMO business had another solid quarter. Its strong double-digit growth rate in the third quarter reflected the success of the initiatives the CDMO team has implemented since the beginning of 2022 to improve performance. We are working diligently to continue to expand our CDMO sales pipeline of new products and are pleased to have cleared several regulatory audits in recent months, including European EMA approval of our Memphis site for the production of a second cell therapy product. We believe that successful regulatory audits will generate additional client interest and support our expectation that we will add new commercial clients.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 410 basis points year-over-year to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2023, but did improve again sequentially. The year-over-year margin decline reflected the lower revenue growth rate and the softer demand trends across the manufacturing end markets.\nWe are intently focused on driving operating margin improvement in the Manufacturing segment, including the profitability of the CDMO business, as this segment is expected to be the largest contributor to achieving our 2026 margin targets.\nWe believe our leading position as an outsourcing partner for our clients' drug discovery and nonclinical drug development efforts is helping us to manage in the current demand environment. The IND enabling and associated nonclinical services that we provide are mandatory to help clients advance their programs into the clinic and eventually to commercialize drugs.\nOur portfolio also differentiates us in the marketplace because of our unique focus on early-stage R&D solutions and our ability to distinguish ourselves scientifically. We believe that these attributes, combined with our continued ability to leverage the significant DSA backlog, will enable us to achieve our financial targets.\nOur value proposition of delivering exquisite science and driving greater efficiency and speed to market continues to differentiate Charles River in the marketplace and is reinforced with today's more budget-focused client base.\nTo conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support.\nNow Flavia will provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance and updated 2023 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning.\nBefore I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to restructuring actions, gains or losses from certain venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nWe're pleased with our third quarter results, which included 4.1% organic revenue growth and an operating margin of 20.5%, representing a 10-basis-point increase on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.72 for the quarter represented a 3.4% increase over the prior year.\nAs expected, increased interest expense, a higher tax rate and the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business continue to restrict year-over-year earnings growth rate, but the headwind is beginning to dissipate as we anniversary last year's interest rate increases.\nOur third quarter results outperformed our prior outlook, but as Jim discussed, we remain cautious with regard to the biopharmaceutical end market demand environment. Our updated outlook for the year reflects our normal practice of narrowing our guidance ranges as we move into the fourth quarter as well as a shift in the gating of our forecast between the third and fourth quarters. This is due in part to lower cancellations and study slippage than forecasted in the third quarter in the DSA segment, offset by a reduced outlook for the Manufacturing segment in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the cumulative effect of these factors, we have narrowed our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue growth in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% on a reported basis and 5.5% to 6.5% on an organic basis, which represent the low end to midpoint of our prior ranges. We expect continued pressure in the Manufacturing segment, reflecting the softer demand trends, including in the Microbial Solutions business, which we believe will be partially offset by a more favorable outlook for our DSA segment for the year.\nWe expect that the consolidated operating margin will be modestly lower than in 2022, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share guidance in a range of $10.50 to $10.70 compared to our prior outlook of $10.30 to $10.90. We'll continue to manage the business in a disciplined manner, with a focus in setting achievable financial targets, protecting our operating margins by managing costs and driving greater efficiency, remaining disciplined with our investments, taking share and implementing other initiatives to improve performance and manage effectively in this environment.\nWe continue to evaluate our operations and we'll appropriately manage our cost structure to align with the current domain environment. Restructuring actions implemented this year are expected to generate approximately $40 million in annualized cost savings. Our updated revenue growth outlook reflects slight revisions for each of our segments. As I just referenced, we are reducing the outlook for our Manufacturing segment to be flat to low single-digit organic growth from our prior outlook in the high single digits.\nFor the RMS segment, we have widened the bottom end of our outlook to mid- to high single-digit organic growth. This reflects the timing of NHP shipments in China, some of which may be deferred to 2024. And our RMS segment also experienced a more discernible impact from mid-tier biopharma clients' softer demand. Our improved outlook for the DSA segment to high single-digit organic revenue growth, principally reflects the lower cancellations and study slippage in the third quarter that I referenced.\nI will now provide some additional details on the nonoperating items that affected our third quarter performance. Unallocated corporate costs in the third quarter totaled $48 million or 4.7% of total revenue compared to 5.8% of revenue last year. The decrease was primarily due to benefits achieved through our virtual power purchase agreements, or VPPAs.\nDespite the favorability in the third quarter, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be approximately 5% of total revenue for the full year. As we announced in October, we have achieved 90% renewable electricity globally through a solar VPPA in North America and a wind VPPA in Europe. These agreements have enabled our facilities in those regions to achieve 100% renewable electricity, providing a key component of our efforts to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 21.6%, representing a 140-basis-point increase from the same period last year. The higher tax rate year-over-year was due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings. However, the tax rate was favorable to our expectations, principally because of discrete tax benefits related to U.S. R&D tax credits. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate will be at the low end of our prior range, or approximately 22.5%, due primarily to the discrete tax benefit.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense for the third quarter was $32.4 million, representing a decrease of $1.2 million sequentially, due primarily to debt repayment. For the full year, we have narrowed our total adjusted net interest expense outlook by $1 million to a range of $131 million to $133 million, as any further rate increases by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year will not have a meaningful impact on our 2023 results.\nAt the end of the third quarter, approximately 80% of our $2.5 billion in outstanding debt was at a fixed interest rate. Our gross and net leverage ratios were both approximately 1.9x at the end of the third quarter. Free cash flow was $139.5 million in the third quarter compared to $60.4 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital as well as lower capital expenditures.\nFor the year, we have narrowed our free cash flow guidance to a range of $340 million to $360 million. Capital expenditures were $65.9 million in the third quarter compared to $72.4 million last year. For the year, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million or below our prior outlook of $340 million to $360 million. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our capital deployment and are committed to aligning our capacity and capital investments with the current demand trends. A summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 37.\nWith 1 quarter remaining in the year, our fourth quarter outlook is effectively embedded in our guidance for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to decline by nearly 10% on a reported basis and at a mid-single-digit rate on an organic basis. This will result in flattish year-over-year organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, which is consistent with the outlook provided in August. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. The fourth quarter outlook largely reflects a very challenging comparison to the prior year when we reported organic revenue growth of 18.8%, including DSA growth of 26.5%.\nIn conclusion, we're pleased with our solid third quarter performance, which is evidence of the resilience of our business, despite a cautious biopharma spending environment as growth rates normalize to pre-pandemic levels. We'll continue to manage our business prudently in response to the challenges we are seeing in the broader market environment and work diligently to achieve our financial targets. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the second quarter of 2023. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website.\nThe replay will be available through the next quarter's conference call. I'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially than those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. We were pleased with our second quarter financial performance, including organic revenue growth of 11.2%. As expected, the revenue growth rates in the RMS and Manufacturing segments improved from first quarter levels, and the DSA segment had another strong quarter with low double-digit revenue growth and operating margin improvement.\nDSA performance reflected the substantial scale and duration of our backlog, which has enabled us to effectively manage the business. For the year, we are narrowing our revenue growth and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the upper end of the previous ranges. This update largely reflects the successful implementation of our mitigation efforts around NHP supply, for which I will provide additional details shortly.\nHowever, we continue to expect the second half growth rates to be pressured, primarily in the DSA segment as a result of 3 primary factors: First, the current market conditions are resulting in a continuation of the lower backlog and booking trends. Second, the DSA segment faces a challenging year-over-year comparison after having generated organic revenue growth of 23.6% in the second half of 2022.\nAnd finally, we still expect a modest impact from NHP supply constraints, principally in the third quarter. We are also closely monitoring the near-term demand trends of our biopharmaceutical clients as they appear to be reprioritizing their pipelines and tightening their R&D budgets. This is affecting our industry and our company, but we will continue to leverage our significant DSA backlog and intend to appropriately manage the business amidst a more cautious biopharma spending environment. During times of funding or macroeconomic uncertainty, Clients are looking for even more efficiency and speed to market, and we believe they will continue to choose an industry leader like Charles River in order to derive additional value from our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions.\nWith regard to NHP supply, we have been effective in our efforts to leverage our global safety assessment infrastructure to alleviate the overall impact of supply constraints caused by the suspension of Cambodian imports into the U.S. and have made significant progress to better utilize our sites outside of the U.S. Based on our progress to date, we believe that we have successfully mitigated the logistical challenges posed by the current NHP supply constraints by conducting more studies outside of the U.S. and better leveraging our global infrastructure, which is a competitive advantage for Charles River.\nWe have been able to effectively transfer a safety assessment work between sites because much of our capacity was built flexibly to accommodate multiple species of both small and large models. The transition of this work to our international sites this year has required time to implement study scheduling, logistics, quarantine operations and retraining of some staff as well as working with local government agencies.\nHowever, we have already made significant progress with these initiatives and do not foresee any meaningful NHP supply constraints affecting the business in the fourth quarter and next year. As a result, we now expect the impact from NHP supply constraints will be less than our initial outlook of a 2% to 4% impact to consolidated revenue growth this year. We have narrowed our DSA organic revenue growth outlook to the mid-single digits or the upper end of the prior range to reflect this positive update on NHP supply, but we also expect this favorable impact to be largely offset by the current DSA demand trends.\nGoing forward, we are operating under the assumption that we will conduct meaningfully the less NHP related study work in the U.S. as our international infrastructure will be sufficient to accommodate this work. I will now provide highlights of our second quarter performance. We reported revenue of $1.06 billion in the second quarter of 2023, an 8.9% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 11.2% was driven by strong performance in the RMS and DSA segments as well as an improvement in the manufacturing growth rate led by the CDMO business. By client segment, second quarter revenue growth was broad-based across global biopharma, biotech and academic and government institutions.\nHowever, demand from global biopharmaceutical clients modestly outpaced small and midsized biotech clients for the second consecutive quarter. This demonstrates the diversity and stability of our overall client base as global continue to move their critical programs forward at a time when biotechs are being more selective with spending to extend their cash runways.\nThe operating margin was 20.4%, a decrease of 140 basis points year-over-year. The decline was driven by continued margin pressure in the manufacturing segment as well as higher unallocated corporate costs. Earnings per share were $2.69 in the second quarter, a decrease of 2.9% from the second quarter of last year. As anticipated, the year-over-year increase in interest expense and the tax rate continued to be meaningful headwinds to earnings growth this year as was the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business. As I mentioned earlier, we have narrowed our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance ranges for the year to the upper ends of the ranges due largely to the successful implementation of our NHP mitigation efforts. We are narrowing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 5.5% to 7.5% and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.30 to $10.90 for 2023.\nWe have increased the lower end of the ranges by 50 basis points and $0.40 per share, respectively. We believe our existing DSA backlog and our in- depth assessment of the normalizing demand trends gives us continued confidence in our financial outlook for this year. I'd like to provide you with additional details on our second quarter segment performance beginning with the DSA segment's results.\nDSA revenue in the second quarter was $663.5 million, increase of 11.7% on an organic basis. The Safety Assessment business continued to drive DSA revenue growth and contributions from base pricing and study volume. NHP pricing was a small benefit to the growth rate, although less of a benefit than in prior quarters. The second quarter performance of the Discovery Services business, which posted lower revenue compared to the prior year was reflective of the current market environment, coupled with the shorter-term nature of both discovery projects and the businesses backlog.\nThe DSA backlog decreased modestly on a sequential basis to $2.8 billion at the end of the second quarter from $3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Net bookings and proposal activity continued to trend lower with net book-to-bill remaining below 1x on a quarterly basis. This was primarily driven by the cancellation rate, which trended higher and accelerated in the second quarter.\nWe believe the cancellation rate has increased because during the peak demand environment over the last few years, clients book studies further in advance of when the work would be required. Now that clients are rationalizing lower priority projects in their pipeline, they are canceling the associated studies. We view this trend is largely a reversion to the mean and expect that as clients complete the pipeline rationalization process. Cancellation rates will decline and the backlog will be more reliably reflect the actual study demand.\nWe believe that cancellations will decline because incoming new business awards for gross booking activity that is not adjusted for cancellations remain robust, resulting in our gross book-to-bill remaining above 1x in the second quarter. We now see clients booking closer to when studies are required, which increases the reliability of the backlog. The current level of gross bookings can support healthy revenue growth rates, which suggests that solid underlying growth prospects for the Safety Assessment business will return once the rate of cancellation subsides.\nWe believe the stabilization of the demand trends will be supported by encouraging macroeconomic indicators as well as stable to improving biotech funding levels. In the second quarter, biotech funding showed the first quarter-over-year increases in 7 quarters on a trailing 12-month basis. We also have an average of 13 months of revenue coverage in our safety coverage and our safety assessment backlog.\nThis solid backlog coverage affords us the ability to appropriately manage the business through fluctuations in demand environment, backfill gaps and study schedule and meet our near-term financial targets. In addition, our level of backlog coverage for the remaining quarters in 2023 is well above the historical prepandemic averages, which gives us additional confidence about the resilience of the business and our ability to achieve our financial goals.\nThe DSA margin was 27.6% in the second quarter, a 230 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2022. The increase continued to be driven by operating leverage associated with higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business. In addition, we are closely monitoring capacity utilization for both physical infrastructure and labor including the pace of capital spending and hiring and are committed to keeping these metrics closely aligned with the current demand environment as the DSA growth rate normalizes.\nRMS revenue was $209.9 million, an increase of 13.9% on an organic basis over the second quarter of 2022. The RMS segment continued to benefit from broad-based growth in all geographic regions for small research models and another exceptional performance from our in-sourcing solutions business led by our cradle initiative.\nIn addition, as we referenced last quarter, the timing of large model shipments within China benefited the second quarter growth rate, leading to the outperformance compared to our full year RMS outlook of high single-digit organic growth. The growth rate for small models in China also benefited from the comparison to last year's modest impact from COVID-related restrictions in the Beijing and Shanghai regions.\nWhile growth rates cooled a bit in the second quarter, we are continuing to see stable demand and pricing for small research models in North America and Europe, which reinforces our growth outlook for the year as you know, these models are essential tools that enable scientists to move their biomedical research programs forward. The stable demand trends also reflect a large base of well-funded clients in the RMS segment as more than half of RMS revenues generated from academic and government institutions and large biopharmaceutical clients.\nThe services businesses continued to be the primary growth driver for RMS with Insourcing Solutions, or IS, leading the way, IS' cradle operations are continuing to expand and generate excellent client interest. We recently opened a new site in Seattle and our first location Philadelphia. Including these locations, we now have 32 cradle sites totaling over 400,000 square feet in 5 states with growing Bio hubs as well as in London and China.\nThe Philadelphia site is expected to cater to a large base of cell and gene therapy companies in the region, a sector of the market, which we continue to believe will generate a final growth opportunities across our portfolio. Our cradle network supports a flexible growth of the entire life sciences ecosystem in each biohub, allowing researchers to utilize our flexible vivarium rental space instead of building their own infrastructure. In the second quarter, the RMS operating margin increased by 150 basis points to 26.4%.\nThis improvement was driven primarily by leverage from higher revenue growth in China due to the timing of large model shipments and last year's COVID-related impact because the timing of large model shipments in China is not linear. We are expecting the third quarter RMS revenue growth rate and operating margin will be a bit lighter than the second quarter as a result of fewer shipments.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing Solutions segment was $186.5 million, an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of last year. The increase was driven by the CDMO and Microbial Solutions businesses, partially offset by continued softer demand for biologics testing. The cell and gene therapy CDMO business had a strong quarter reporting a solid double-digit growth rate. We are very pleased that the initiatives the CDMO team implemented over the past 18 months to improve performance have been successful and are beginning to generate the intended results.\nThe creation of centers of excellence in gene-modified cell therapy, viral vectors and plasmids has more optimally aligned the business and investments in the commercial readiness of our operations and efforts to continue to improve the sales funnel for new projects have also contributed to the performance improvement. We are also pleased to be working with a commercial cell therapy client in Memphis and have a few other clients who are nearing commercial launches over the next 1 to 2 years at both Memphis and our gene therapy center of excellence in Maryland.\nMicrobial Solutions delivered a solid second quarter performance led by the continued strength of the Accugenix microbial identification platform. Last month, we were very pleased to have completed the launch of our Endosafe Trillium recombinant Cascade reagent or RCR for bacterial endotoxin testing.\nAs the animal-free solution reinforces our commitment to sustainability initiatives and provides a recombinant alternative for Endosafe clients who wish to become early adopters of more sustainable testing methods, Trillium utilizes 3 biological proteins which we believe provides superior accuracy and testing outcomes to competitor single protein alternatives as well as equivalents to LAL-based testing measures.\nWith the launch of reagent kits in July, we plan to have Trillium cartridges available this winter, which clients will be able to utilize in their existing end-state systems for a seamless transition from LAL to RCR. We believe the client adoption will be gradual over the next several years as most clients will likely continue to rely on our LAL-based Endosafe cartridges, which utilizes 95% less LAL than traditional methods.\nThe introduction of the Animal free trillion solution supports our advancement of responsible science and further enhances our industry-leading position as the only provider who can offer a comprehensive solution for rapid manufacturing and quality control testing. Testing volume in the biologics testing business improved from the seasonally soft first quarter level, but the year-over-year growth rate continued to be pressured, particularly for viral clearance and cell banking services.\nWe believe that performance is indicative of the current market dynamics of clients reprioritizing projects and becoming more budget-focused, particularly for services that could be conducted at various times during the development process. Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 570 basis points year-over-year to 22.9% in the second quarter of 2023 but did improve sequentially as anticipated.\nThe year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the biologics testing and CDMO businesses, but we do expect the segment margin to continue to trend higher particularly as the CDMO performance continues to improve. We were very pleased with the second quarter results, which gave us the confidence to narrow our 2023 revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the upper ends of the previous ranges. Although some demand trends are moderating, we believe that the fundamental drivers of our business are intact, and we are well positioned to manage through any near-term fluctuations for several reasons.\nFirst, when clients are under intense pressure to bring new drugs to market, we believe they will always seek a large experience in the partner like Charles River, who can provide the greatest value to them through unmatched scientific expertise and flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions.\nSecond, the scale and duration of our DSA backlog provides us visibility to more effectively manage the business through timing and location using our global network of facilities. And third, we will continue to drive a culture of continuous improvement, speed and efficiency as a result of our digital transformation, which provides us with better access to data and insights internally to appropriately manage costs and investments and enables our clients to access real-time data, e-commerce solutions and other self-service tools.\nAnd finally, we believe the power of our unique portfolio differentiates us today more than ever from other companies that provide R&D support services to the biopharmaceutical industry. As part of our annual strategic planning process, we recently completed a thorough review of the current market environment, our growth prospects and the strategic imperatives for our company. Through this process, we believe the current end market trends could be characterized as a normalization from the past several years when there was unprecedented focus on investment in biomedical research and scientific innovation.\nHowever, we are optimistic that we will be able to capitalize on the many opportunities our markets provide. We intend to share more of our conclusions and update our longer-term financial targets at our virtual Investor Day, which we have planned for Thursday, September 21. To conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support. Now Flavia will provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance and 2023 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, gains or losses from our venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation.\nWe're pleased with our results for the second quarter, which included organic revenue growth of 11.2% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.69. These results, which are consistent with our prior outlook reflect the continued resilience and stability of our businesses, even during times of macroeconomic pressure.\nAs was the case in the first quarter, increased interest expense, a higher tax rate and the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business continued to restrict the year-over-year earnings growth rate. Our first half results and our updated NHP supply outlook support our revenue growth and earnings per share guide in the full year, which has now been narrowed to the upper end of the prior ranges.\nWe continue to be well positioned to deliver reported revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and organic revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share between $10.30 and $10.90 and free cash flow of $330 million to $380 million for the year. Our updated revenue growth outlook for 2023 reflects our revised assumptions about 2 headwinds that will affect the second half growth rate, particularly in the DSA segment.\nFirst, the impact of NHP Supply is expected to be below our original estimate of a 2% to 4% impact to total revenue growth. This favorability will be largely offset by the impact of macroeconomic and funding pressures on biopharma client demand trends. For the DSA segment, we expect the cumulative effect of these factors to result in a slightly more favorable outlook for the year, with revenue growth rates in the mid-single digits on a reported and organic basis for the year.\nThe Manufacturing segment benefited from continued traction in the CDMO business in the second quarter but we expect continued pressure on the biologics testing growth rate due to a more budget-focused client base. As a result, we're reducing our reported growth outlook for the Manufacturing segment to a low to mid-single-digit decline and marrying our organic segment growth outlook to a high single-digit increase.\nThe RMS segment growth outlook remains unchanged with a high single-digit growth on both a reported and organic basis. With regard to the consolidated operating margin for the full year, we expect the margin to be flat to slightly lower than in 2022. We will continue our efforts to manage costs, reduce discretionary spending and drive efficiency as well as monitor the demand environment to ensure our cost structure is closely aligned.\nI will now provide some additional details on the nonoperating items in the second quarter. Unallocated corporate costs totaled $65.1 million or 6.1% of total revenue in the second quarter compared to 4.1% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily related to the timing of corporate expenses which fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nWith a lower level in the first quarter, corporate costs averaged 5.2% of revenue in the first half of the year, and we expect approximately 5% for the full year. The second quarter tax rate was 23.3%, representing a 220 basis point increase from the same period last year, but consistent with our full year outlook. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a lower benefit associated with stock-based compensation. and other headwinds related to discrete tax items.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate will be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, which is unchanged from the outlook we provided in May. In the second quarter, total adjusted net interest expense was $33.6 million, which is essentially flat sequentially. For the full year, we now expect total adjusted net interest expense will be in the range of $131 million to $134 million. This is slightly lower than our prior outlook, primarily as a result of our assumption that the Federal Reserve will take a less aggressive stand towards interest rate hikes for the remainder of the year.\nAs a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, approximately 3/4 of our $2.68 billion in debt was at a fixed interest rate. With regard to the variable rate portion of our debt, our outlook can accommodate an additional 50 basis points of rate increases for the remainder of 2023. At the end of the second quarter, our outstanding debt balance represented a gross leverage ratio of 2.1x and a net leverage ratio of 2x.\nWe continuously evaluate our capital priorities and intend to deploy capital to the areas that we believe will generate the greatest returns. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that strategic acquisitions will generate the greater shareholder returns by enhancing our growth potential. But in the near term, we intend to continue to focus on debt repayment. Free cash flow was $80.7 million in the second quarter compared to $66.6 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital.\nFor the year, our free cash flow guidance of $330 million to $380 million remains unchanged. Capital expenditures were $67.4 million in the second quarter compared to $82.9 million last year, primarily as a result of timing of projects. We will continue to monitor the demand environment and intend to keep capacity and capital investments closely aligned with market trends.\nWe continue to expect to make capital investments in the range of $340 million to $360 million for the full year, which is in the 8% range as a percent of total revenue. A summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 40. We're expecting the second half consolidated organic revenue growth rate to average in a range of flat to low single-digit growth.\nThe slower growth from first half levels is due to 3 principal factors, including the modest NHP related supply impact in the third quarter, a more cautious biopharma spending environment and also difficult growth comparisons to the second half of last year. These items will have the most significant impact on the DSA growth rates. The Manufacturing segment's performance is expected to continue to improve from the first half levels.\nAnd the RMS segment is expected to continue to deliver solid performance with a third quarter RMS growth rate and operating margin a bit lighter due to the timing of large model shipments in China. For the third quarter, we expect low single-digit revenue growth on both a reported and organic basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to decline by approximately 10% from the third quarter 2022 level.\nIn closing, we continue to focus on the execution of our strategy and delivering solid financial and operational results. We're pleased with our first half performance, and despite some macroeconomic and funding pressures on our biopharma clients, we believe the fundamental drivers of our business and our solid financial position will enable us to successfully navigate this environment.\nWe operate in a durable industry with attractive long-term growth prospects, and we'll continue to leverage our capabilities, expertise and proven strategy to fully support our clients' evolving needs, and achieve our full year financial outlook. Thank you\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the first quarter of 2023. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com.\nA webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call. I'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated. During this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning. We had a strong start to the year with organic revenue growth of 15.4% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.78 both wildly exceeding the outlook that we provided in February. The year began with a continuation of the strong demand and pricing environment in our DSA segment that we experienced through the end of last year. This was expected based on the strength of the backlog, which supports more than a year of DSA revenue. Clients continue to choose to partner with Charles River for our industry-leading scientific expertise for the breadth and depth of our portfolio and for the flexible, efficient outsourcing solutions that we are able to provide to them.\nWe are a large, stable scientific partner focused on holistically supporting our clients' drug discovery, nonclinical development and manufacturing efforts, which we believe is increasingly important in the current market environment. The biopharmaceutical end market seems slightly less robust than last year, which we had anticipated and factored into our initial guidance in February. Clients appear to be more thoughtful about their spending and have prioritized their programs at the beginning of the year. This is not surprising in light of the changing macroeconomic factors that are present today and the unprecedented level of biomedical research activity that occurred over the past several years. However, we still believe that our client base remains adequately funded with 1 sell-side analyst recently estimating that public biotechs still have about 3 years of cash on hand.\nAlthough we continue to watch the market closely, and are seeing a normalization of demand trends towards pre-pandemic levels. Our clients are continuing to move thousands of their critical programs forward with us. So we believe these trends and current business development activity firmly support our financial guidance for the year. Before I provide more details on our first quarter financial results, I would like to provide a brief update on the nonhuman primate or NHP supply situation.\nAs you know, we suspended shipments of Cambodian NHPs into the U.S. in February. We took this action so that we could develop and implement new testing procedures that would reinforce our confidence that the NHPs we import from Cambodia, our purpose brand. We have made advancements towards identifying a new testing platform and implementing the new testing procedures and are engaged with the relevant government agencies in furtherance of the needed resolution. We have also been working in parallel to accommodate our clients and HP-related study stocks by utilizing our global Safety Assessment site network.\nOur global scale is one of the key factors, which we believe differentiates us from the competition. We believe that these efforts will mitigate some of the NHP supply impact on our clients' programs that we expect during the second half of the year and afford us greater confidence in our 2023 financial guidance. Our wider guidance range continues to accommodate a number of scenarios related to the success of our mitigation efforts since our plans have not yet been fully implemented and NHP supply remains a fluid situation.\nAs a reminder, biologic drugs cannot be approved for commercial use without NHPs. And it is critical that we work diligently with industry and government agencies to resolve the NHP situation and restore this important supply chain so that life-saving therapies can continue to move forward. I'll now provide highlights of our first quarter performance. Reported revenue of $1.03 billion in the first quarter of 2023, a 12.6% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 15.4% and was driven by the robust DSA performance as well as solid RMS growth. The manufacturing growth rate was impacted by a challenging year-over-year comparison as well as lower-than-anticipated biologics testing volume to start the year.\nBy client segment, global biopharmaceutical companies, small and midsized biotechs and academic and government accounts all made significant contributions to the growth rate. The operating margin was 21.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. The decline was driven by the Manufacturing and RMS segments. Earnings per share were $2.78 in the first quarter, an increase of 1.1% from the first quarter of last year, strong low double-digit operating income growth was modestly -- was mostly offset by increased interest expense and a higher tax rate compared to the prior year as well as the impact of the AVN vaccine divestiture.\nBased on the strong first quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, which remain largely consistent with our initial outlook, we are narrowing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 5% to 7.5% and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $9.90 to $10.90 for 2023. We have increased the lower end of the ranges by 50 basis points and $0.20 per share, respectively. As I mentioned, our outlook continues to reflect the anticipated financial impact of the Cambodian NHP supply constraints, which will have a greater impact on the second half results.\nI'd like to provide you with additional details on our first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the first quarter were $662.4 million, another significant increase of 23.6% on an organic basis. The Safety Assessment business continued to be the principal driver of DSA revenue growth, with significant contributions from study volume and base pricing with NHP pass-throughs also adding to the growth rate.\nAlthough revenue for Discovery Services increased in the quarter, growth rate continued to modulate which we believe is reflective of the current market environment, coupled with the shorter-term nature of both Discovery projects and the business's backlog. The DSA backlog decreased modestly on a sequential basis to $3 billion at the end of the first quarter from $3.15 billion at year-end. As previously mentioned in February, this trend is reflective of the normalization of looking and proposal activity that we experienced at the end of last year and in the first quarter.\nClients are not booking work as far out as they did over the past few years and we believe this is the result of the evaluation of pipeline priorities and scheduling with a nearer-term focus. That said, we believe these trends in the current market environment, coupled with the strength of our current backlog, and which still affords us 14 months of revenue coverage in our Safety Assessment business will drive the expected DSA revenue growth this year.\nOur client base remains stable and resilient. Our biotech clients continue to send us new programs and generated healthy double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter. It was also encouraging to see that biotech funding levels increased year-over-year by more than 20% in the first quarter to approximately $15 billion. We believe this higher funding demonstrates that venture capital remains a reliable source of funding to enable biotech clients to spend on their promising molecules and the public markets had a better quarter.\nMoreover, large biopharmaceutical companies continue to move programs forward with vigor, with first quarter revenue growth outpacing biotech and demonstrating the strength and balance of our client base. Through the first 4 months of the year, 14 new drugs were approved by the FDA, which is on pace to exceed last year's total. Since we have worked on over 80% of the FDA-approved drugs over the last 5 years, we believe the pipeline of new drug supports ample future growth opportunities for us.\nHowever, after 3 consecutive quarters with extraordinary revenue growth above the 20% level, the DSA growth rate is expected to moderate over the course of this year due to 3 primary factors. The normalization of the demand trends, as just discussed, more challenging year-over-year comparisons as 2023 progresses and the impact of NHP supply constraints mostly in the second half of the year. We expect less of an impact from NHP supply constraints in the second quarter than originally planned because of our ability to collaborate with our clients optimize study schedules, leverage our flexible global infrastructure and also due to our extensive backlog coverage across multiple study types.\nAnd as I said earlier, the strong first quarter results and our progress with regard to additional mitigation efforts a and HP supply constraints over the course of this year have also improved our confidence in our full year financial guidance. We are moving forward with plans to reconfirm NHP study starts that are already scheduled for the second half of the year. Based on communications with our clients, we are confident that we remain the preferred partner for their preclinical development activities because of our global scale, scientific differentiation, exceptional quality and the value that we bring to the research and development efforts.\nEven in this time of disruption in the NHP supply chain, we do not believe the competition can provide a better value proposition to clients than we can. The DSA operating margin was 29% for the first quarter a 610 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2022. The increase continued to be driven by operating leverage associated with a meaningfully higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business as well as price increases.\nRMS revenue was $199.8 million, an increase of 6.8% on an organic basis over the first quarter of 2022. The RMS segment benefited from broad-based demand for small research models in all geographic regions for research model services and for the sell solutions business. The RMS growth rate was below the high single-digit target for the year due primarily to RMS China, while demand for small models remain strong, the timing of NHP shipments to clients in China impacted the first quarter growth rate. Since exports from China were shut down at the beginning of the pandemic, we have been selling a relatively small number of NHPs locally to clients since we were unable to utilize these models in our global Safety Assessment operations.\nWe expect the RMS growth rate to meaningfully improve in the second quarter as the NHPs are shipped in China and we continue to expect RMS to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth in 2023. Outside of China, revenue growth for small research models in North America and Europe remains strong. driven by healthy volume increases in North America and continued pricing gains globally. We believe demand for research models is an excellent indicator of the health and stability of early-stage research activity. The demand and pricing trends this year demonstrate that clients are continuing to move their research program forward, which will drive solid RMS revenue growth.\nFrom a services perspective, revenue growth was also broad-based with the Insourcing Solutions and GEMS businesses leading the way. Insourcing Solutions, or IS, growth continued to be primarily driven by our cradle operations which offer flexible vivarium rental space at Charles River sites to both small and large biopharmaceutical clients. Having expanded significantly last year through both the acquisition of Explorer Biolabs, and by adding 9 [ trade ] and Explorer sites, we are now focused on ramping up utilization of the new sites as well as continuing to moderately add new sites.\nThis will generate a runway for continued robust revenue growth and margin enhancement opportunities for cradle. Our traditional IS model, which provides staffing and vivaria management at our client sites still resonates with clients. It has historically had a larger academic and government client base. However, commercial clients are also seeking the benefits of driving cost savings and greater operational efficiency by allowing us to manage their internal vivarium. We were pleased to add a new meaningful commercial biopharmaceutical contract in the first quarter.\nWe also continue to expand our GEMS business in North America to accommodate increasing demand from both biopharmaceutical and academic clients as they partner with us to maintain their proprietary genetically modified model [indiscernible] These models are playing an increasingly critical role as drug research becomes more complex with a shift to oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapies. In the first quarter, the RMS operating margin decreased by 650 basis points to 23.4%. Most of the decline was driven by the temporary headwind related to timing of NHP shipments within China. Revenue mix was also a factor due in part to the Explorer acquisition in April 2022 and the ramp-up of utilization in our cradle and Explorer operations, which were expanded last year.\nWe expect the RMS operating margin to meaningfully improve in the second quarter as these headwinds subside. Revenue for the Manufacturing Solutions segment was $167.3 million, a decrease of 1.8% on an organic basis compared to the first quarter of last year. The decrease was driven by the CDMO and Biologics testing businesses, partially offset by a solid performance for the Microbial Solutions business. As we mentioned in February, we expected the segment's year-over-year revenue comparison would be challenging due to commercial readiness milestones in the CDMO business and COVID vaccine testing revenue in the Biologics Testing business.\nBoth of which occurred in the first quarter of last year. We believe these factors will be largely anniversaried beginning in the second quarter. In addition to these factors, the biologics testing business experienced a slower start to the year. Testing volume tends to be seasonally softer in the first quarter. With lower sample volume reflecting reduced client manufacturing activity over the holidays. This year, we also experienced lower-than-anticipated volumes, particularly for viral clearance and cell banking services. Because clients seem to be prioritizing their programs and more budget focused at the beginning of the year.\nMicrobial Solutions delivered a solid first quarter performance led by the continued strength of the Accugenix microbial identification platform due to both instrument placements and demand for our testing services. Our advantage is as the only provider who can offer a comprehensive solution for rapid manufacturing and quality control testing continues to resonate with our clients. The cell and gene therapy CDMO business continued to make progress towards its targeted growth rate goal.\nAs expected, the growth rate was affected by the comparison to the commercial readiness milestones paid in the first quarter of last year, but the initiatives that we have implemented to improve the performance of our CDMO business continue to gain traction and earn positive feedback from clients. We believe that the success of these actions and an increasing sales funnel will result in a marked improvement in the CDMO growth rate in the second quarter. Now we expect the CDMO business will drive a rebound in the Manufacturing segment organic growth rate over the course of the year. The Manufacturing segment's first quarter operating margin was 13.7%, and a significant decline from 33.1% in the first quarter of last year.\nThe decline was primarily related to lower operating margins in each of the segment's business units, particularly CDMO and biologics testing. This was driven largely by the prior year headwinds and the slower start in the biologics testing business that I discussed as well as an asset impairment in the segment. As anticipated, end market dynamics have moderated somewhat in 2023, but it's important to reiterate that our client base remains stable and resilient, particularly biotech. These companies have now become the innovation engine for the entire biopharmaceutical industry with a number of biopharma companies with active pipelines doubling over the past 10 years.\nWe believe the early stage research that we conducted is instrumental to our biotech clients achievement of the important milestones that enable them to secure additional funding, and therefore, they will continue to partner with Charles River for our flexible and efficient platform that accelerates their therapeutic innovation. These factors, coupled with the strength and scale of our DSA backlog and the substantial visibility that it provides will enable us to better withstand any near-term fluctuation in the market.\nWe believe the power of our unique portfolio differentiates us today more than ever. From other companies that provide R&D support services to the biopharmaceutical industry. We are continuing to further distinguish ourselves scientifically by adding capabilities in biologics and cell and gene therapies. By investing in technology partnerships to bring cutting-edge tools to our clients and by building greater digital connectivity with our clients, including through the launch of Apollo in March.\nApollo will revolutionize client access to real-time study data, planning and cost estimates and other self-service tools. To conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their continued support. Now Flavia will provide additional details on our first quarter financial performance and 2023 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. And good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, gains or losses from our venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which included revenue and earnings per share well above the outlook that we provided in February.\nWe delivered strong organic revenue growth of 15.4%, wildly outperforming our prior expectations. Higher revenue and a solid operating performance contributed to earnings per share of $2.78, a 1.1% increase over the prior year compared to the outlook we provided in February of a mid-single-digit decline. As Jim mentioned, we have narrowed our previous revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the strong first quarter performance. We now expect to deliver reported revenue growth of 2% to 4.5% and organic revenue growth of 5% to 7.5% for the full year as well as non-GAAP earnings per share in a range of $9.90 to $10.90 for the full year.\nOur 2023 revenue guidance ranges continue to reflect the estimated impact from the NHP supply constraints, resulting in wider guidance ranges to account for multiple outcomes with respect to our mitigation plans. We are expecting stronger revenue growth rates in the first half of 2023 due to both the comparison to last year when growth accelerated throughout the year, as well as the anticipated gating of the NHP supply impact, which will principally impact the second half.\nOur segment outlook for 2023 revenue growth remains largely unchanged, as noted on Slide 34. We also continue to expect that the consolidated operating margin will be flat to lower versus prior year depending on the ultimate success of our plans to mitigate the NHP supply constraints. Unallocated corporate costs were favorable in the quarter totaling 4.3% of total revenue compared to 5% of revenue in the first quarter of last year.\nThe decrease was primarily the result of climbing of health and fringe costs, which are expected to normalize over the course of the year. Despite the favorability in the first quarter, we expect unallocated corporate costs to total approximately 5% of revenue for the full year, which is similar to 2022. The first quarter tax rate was 21.7% approximately 490 basis points higher year-over-year as anticipated.\nThe increase was primarily due to a lower benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, which is unchanged from our previous outlook. Total adjusted net interest expense was $33.6 million in the first quarter, essentially flat on a sequential basis. The significant year-over-year increase from $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, which compressed earnings growth in the quarter, primarily reflected meaningfully higher interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions since March of 2022.\nFor the year, we continue to expect net interest expense of $133 million to $137 million. As a reminder, nearly 3/4 of our $2.75 billion debt at the end of the first quarter was at a fixed rate. With regards to the remaining variable rate portion of our debt, our outlook can accommodate an additional 50 basis point increase in rates by the Federal Reserve during the remainder of 2023. At the end of the first quarter, our gross leverage ratio was 2.2x, and our net leverage ratio was 2.1x.\nFree cash flow was $2.5 million in the first quarter compared to $22.2 million last year, with higher capital expenditures driving the decrease. As a reminder, the first quarter is a seasonally softer period for free cash flow generation. Capital expenditures were $106.9 million in the first quarter compared to $80.5 million last year, due primarily to ongoing expansion projects to support continued growth across our business.\nToday, we're initiating 2023 guidance for free cash flow and capital expenditures. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $330 million to $380 million, which is flat to a 15% increase from $330 million in 2022. CapEx is expected to be slightly below our recently stated target of 9% of revenue. At $340 million to $360 million this year. The lower capital intensity reflects our disciplined approach to capital deployment. We are investing in our business based on the growth potential of each business unit and are modifying certain projects in light of the temporary disruption from the NHP supply constraints.\nNormalizing the main trends will result in less capital required than we previously anticipated. A summary of our 2023 financial guidance can be found on Slide 40. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect year-over-year reported revenue growth in a high single-digit range and organic revenue growth of 10% or better. Reflecting continued strong growth trends across many of our businesses.\nWe expect the NHP supply issue will have only a limited impact on the second quarter DSA growth rate as we're able to schedule flexibly and expect to leverage the strength of our backlog to slot in other studies when necessary. Earnings per share are expected to decline at a mid-single-digit rate compared to $2.77 in the second quarter of last year. As the higher tax rate and increased interest expense will continue to restrict the year-over-year earnings growth rate.\nIn closing, we're pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident about our prospects for the second quarter as well as our ability to achieve our full year financial outlook. Even as macroeconomic and biopharmaceutical market conditions evolve, we will continue to execute our strategy of expanding our business to both meet the needs of our clients and to enhance our position as the scientific partner of choice to accelerate biomedical research and therapeutic innovation. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Before I speak about our strong fourth quarter results, I want to provide an update on the nonhuman primate or NHP supply situation. As many of you are aware, there has been an ongoing industry-wide investigation into NHP imports from Cambodia.\nOn February 17, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice related to an investigation into the Cambodian NHP supply chain. We have been informed this investigation relates specifically to shipments of NHPs received by Charles River from our Cambodian supplier. We intend to fully cooperate with the U.S. government. Once the Department of Justice concludes its investigation, we believe it will find that any concerns with respect to Charles River are without merit.\nAs we have stated before, we are committed to ensuring our operations are fully compliant with all U.S. and international laws and regulations. And we maintain risk-based supplier due diligence, audit and management practices to help ensure the quality of our supplier relationships and compliance of applicable laws, including the status of the NHPs we import.\nBased on ongoing investigations and a heightened focus on the Cambodia NHP supply chain, in recent months, we have voluntarily suspended planned future shipments of Cambodian NHPs until such time that we and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can develop and implement new procedures to reinforce confidence that the NHPs we import from Cambodia are purpose-bred. This will take time to implement and the duration of which is unknown.\nThe investigation in current NHP supply situation will result in study delays in our Safety Assessment business. By way of background, NHPs are the most scientifically relevant large model for the regulatory required safety testing of biologic drugs as mandated by the FDA and other international regulatory agencies.\nBiologic drugs cannot be approved for commercial use without NHPs. And given the proliferation of biologic drug development activity in recent years, NHPs have been in high demand. As an example, all of the COVID-19 vaccines developed in the United States and Europe utilized NHPs.\nIn recent years, NHPs sourced from Cambodia have been responsible for approximately 60% of the NHPs supplied to the United States and to Charles River for drug research and development. While there is no other near-term global source to replace this supply, we are continuing to actively work to diversify our NHP supply chain.\nIt's critical that we work diligently to resolve the NHP supply situation and collaborate with all agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to restore this important supply chain because the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the patients who need new life-saving treatments are counting on us.\nThe current Cambodian NHP supply constraints and the corresponding impact to our Safety Assessment business are expected to reduce our consolidated revenue growth forecast by approximately 200 to 400 basis points this year, resulting in organic revenue growth guidance of 4.5% to 7.5% for the total company.\nThe non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $9.70 to $10.90 in 2023 with the wider ranges encompassing a number of scenarios related to the timing of the resumption of Cambodian NHP imports this year. The top end of our guidance ranges anticipate that we will have Cambodian NHPs available for studies in the fourth quarter, whereas the bottom end of our guidance assumes that we will have no Cambodian NHP imports for the remainder of 2023. In either case, we expect to begin to experience a more meaningful impact from NHP supply constraints in the second quarter.\nIn addition to NHP supply, several nonoperating items are significantly affecting the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in 2023, including higher interest expense, a higher tax rate and the divestiture of our Avian Vaccine business, which was completed in December. These items will generate a combined earnings per share headwind of $1.20 to $1.40 in 2023, partially offset by up to a $0.25 benefit from foreign exchange. Flavia will discuss these items in more detail shortly.\nNow I'll speak with you about an outstanding finish to another strong year for Charles River. We reported robust operating performance in 2022, highlighted by 13.4% organic revenue growth against the backdrop of escalating macroeconomic pressures.\n2022 performance demonstrates the continued execution of our strategy, which enables us to enhance our position as the scientific partner of choice to accelerate biomedical research and therapeutic innovation. Let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance.\nWe reported record quarterly revenue of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding the $1 billion mark for the first time and representing an increase of 21.5% on an organic -- on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 18.8% was driven by increases from all 3 business segments with the most significant contribution from the DSA segment due to another robust performance in the Safety Assessment business.\nIn the second half, DSA organic growth rate rose to 23.6% as we exceeded the second half growth acceleration that we had forecast since the beginning of last year. For 2022, revenue was $3.98 billion with a reported growth rate of 12.3% and an organic growth rate of 13.4%. The revenue growth rates exceeded the top end of our guidance range by 140 basis points driven primarily by outperformance in both the Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses.\nThe operating margin was 20.4% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the Manufacturing and RMS segments. For the full year, the operating margin was unchanged at 21%. We are pleased to have held the operating margin steady in a year with substantial cost inflation and the CDMO business generated significant margin pressure.\nEarnings per share were $2.98 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 19.7% from $2.49 in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, earnings per share were $11.12, a 7.8% increase over the prior year.\nWe exceeded our last guidance range of $10.80 to $10.95 due primarily to the robust fourth quarter revenue growth, particularly in the DSA segment. We believe our 2022 performance thoroughly demonstrated the successful execution of our strategy to position Charles River as the nonclinical drug development partner of choice for our valued clients as well as the sustained pace of demand from these clients despite macroeconomic headwinds. Our exceptional market position, unique early-stage focus and our large diversified client base give us confidence that many of the underlying business trends will remain intact in 2023.\nI'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our expectations for 2023 beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $691.7 million or a substantial 26.5% increase on an organic basis.\nThe Safety Assessment business continued to be the principal driver of DSA revenue growth with significant contributions from study volume, pricing and NHP pass-throughs in order of magnitude. As we have often mentioned, our business is not linear. In this case, the record fourth quarter DSA revenue growth was driven by a combination of the current robust demand and pricing environment as well as the comparison to the fourth quarter of '21 when the business experienced some resource constraints, including staffing.\nThe Discovery Business Services growth rate also improved in the quarter. For the full year, DSA organic revenue growth was also a record 17.5%, exceeding our midterm's outlook. As of year-end, the DSA backlog has increased 32% year-over-year to $3.15 billion. The backlog remained robust in 2022 and continues to support a long growth runway and also normalized during the year as expected because the backlog duration stabilized after substantially elongating in prior years.\nWe are continuing to see broad-based and sustained client demand across our Safety Assessment business as we have the staffing and capacity to accommodate this client demand. The current NHP supply situation may restrict the revenue growth rate and margin expansion in 2023, but the underlying strength and resilience of demand environment and pricing should afford us with healthy DSO growth opportunities once the NHP supply situation is resolved and we have an adequate supply of these large models.\nThe Discovery Services business had a good quarter with improvement in the revenue growth rate from the third quarter level. Many of our clients who previously have lengthened the time frame to start new projects moved forward with their programs in the fourth quarter.\nDiscovery booking and proposal activity also support a healthy growth profile as we begin 2023. In order to strengthen our position as a single-source partner to support our clients' early-stage research needs, we continue to expand our discovery capabilities through our technology partnership strategy and through M&A.\nWe achieved both with SAMDI Tech, which we acquired in January. We established an initial partnership with SAMDI Tech in 2018, and we were able to validate their proprietary mass spectrometry technology for label-free, high-throughput screening with our clients.\nDuring the partnership, we determined that SAMDI Tech's cutting-edge technology was increasingly favored by clients to accelerate their timelines and reduce the costs required to identify a lead drug candidate and make critical go/no-go decisions earlier. As a result of the successful partnership, we mutually agreed to have SAMDI Tech join Charles River.\nPartnerships and acquisitions like this advance our ongoing efforts to build our scientific expertise for the discovery of novel therapeutics and strengthen our discovery toolkit by adding cutting-edge capabilities to enable clients to work with us for a single project or on an integrated program in a flexible manner tailored to their specific outsourcing needs.\nThe DSA operating margin was 26.3% in the fourth quarter, a 320 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of '21. For the year, the DSA operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 25.3%. Both increases were driven primarily by operating leverage associated with the meaningfully higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business.\nRMS' revenue in the fourth quarter was $196.1 million, an increase of 10.8% on an organic basis. For the year, RMS' organic revenue growth was 9%, squarely in line with our outlook of high single-digit growth in 2022.\nAccelerating growth for Research Model Services, particularly our CRADL initiative and research models in North America and China, drove the exceptional RMS' revenue growth rates for the fourth quarter and full year. We also continue to benefit from meaningful price increases, which were implemented in part to offset inflationary cost pressures. We expect similar trends will drive high single-digit organic growth again in 2023.\nIn the Research Model business, North America continued to generate strong revenue growth. And China, although reporting a double-digit increase, experienced a modest impact from an increase in COVID cases during the fourth quarter. The expansion of the central, southern and western regions of China are progressing well, and each new set is operational with 2 sites already shipping research models. This will enable us to continue to generate robust double-digit growth in China and gain additional market share.\nResearch Model Services also continued to perform well with broad-based growth across Insourcing Solutions and GEMS in the fourth quarter and for the year. Growth was primarily driven by Insourcing Solutions' CRADL operations or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs, including last year's Explora acquisition.\nClients are increasingly adopting this flexible model to access vivarium space without having to invest in internal infrastructure. Explora continued to perform very well, and the combined CRADL footprint now encompasses 28 vivarium facilities totaling over 380,000 square feet of turnkey rental capacity. CRADL and Explora provide us with a new and unique pathway to connect with clients in earlier stages, enabling these clients to invest in the research and not in infrastructure, preferring to leverage Charles River's broader capabilities to continue to advance their research.\nThe RMS' operating margin declined by 420 basis points year-over-year to 22.7% in the fourth quarter and by 210 basis points to 25.2% in 2022. The declines were primarily attributable to the 53rd week, which has a greater impact on the RMS segment, headwinds from expansions of our CRADL and Explora operations and new RMS sites in China and also a modest COVID impact in China. We anticipate that each of these factors will either be eliminated or generate less of an impact in 2023, resulting in improvement in the RMS operating margin.\nManufacturing Solutions revenue was $212.1 million in the fourth quarter, a growth rate of 5.3% on an organic basis, and the full year organic growth rate was also 5.3%, in line with our mid-single-digit outlook for 2022.\nThe segment growth rate in 2022 was compressed by lower revenue in the CDMO business. The initiatives that we have implemented to improve the performance of our CDMO business continue to gain traction and earn positive feedback from clients.\nOur creation of centers of excellence for cell therapies, viral vectors and plasmids has been well received. And coupled with our focus on CDMO business development efforts and investing in the commercial readiness of our operations, we are generating new client interest.\nWe have won over $100 million of new CDMO projects over the past 12 months and more than 2/3 of which are for our world-class cell therapy operations in Memphis. We believe that a stronger sales funnel will result in a gradual improvement in the CDMO performance during 2023 as the business returns to its targeted growth rates. We expect the CDMO business will drive a rebound in the Manufacturing segment organic growth rate to the low double digits in 2023.\nThe Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses both performed very well in the fourth quarter, benefiting from robust client demand as the growth prospects for these legacy manufacturing quality control businesses remain strong. These businesses and the Manufacturing segment in total will continue to be principally driven by demand for biologic drugs, including cell and gene therapies and other complex biologics.\nMicrobial Solutions had a strong quarter and full year, benefiting from broad-based growth across its Endosafe endotoxin testing and Accugenix microbial identification testing platforms. We are continuing to convert the marketplace to our more efficient and reliable quality control testing platform.\nThe continued expansion of the installed base of instruments drives demand for the consumable cartridges and reagents, which provides a healthy recurring revenue stream. We believe Microbial Solutions' long-term growth potential continues to be approximately 10%, including in 2023.\nThe Biologics Testing business reported an excellent fourth quarter and full year. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continue to be the primary growth factor as well as traditional biologics. And the business had an excellent year despite the moderation of COVID vaccine testing revenue during 2022.\nWe have been successful in maintaining -- we have been successful at gaining business because of our extensive portfolio of services to support the safe manufacture of biologics. We believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the longer term.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating growth declined meaningfully in both the fourth quarter and full year to 25.3% and 28.8%, respectively. As has been the case all year, the decline was driven almost entirely by the underperformance of the CDMO business.\nBased on our expectations for the CDMO business, we believe the Manufacturing operating margin will improve meaningfully in 2023 to above the 30% level. As you know, there is inherent operating leverage in our businesses. So as project volumes improve in the CDMO business, we expect the margin profile will follow.\nIn 2022, we celebrated our Charles River's 75th anniversary. We're delighted to have evolved from a small revolutionary research model company overlooking the Charles River to a leading global drug discovery and development partner, generating nearly $4 billion in annual revenue and helping to lead the biopharmaceutical industry's essential nonclinical drug development efforts.\nAs we look to 2023, we continue to see a resilient funding environment, the continued renaissance in the golden age of scientific innovation, our clients' increasing use of strategic outsourcing and their need for enhanced efficiency and speed to market. Our core competencies, including our extensive scientific knowledge and our focus on preclinical R&D, are precisely tailored to these trends and make us an even more indispensable partner to advance our clients' life-saving therapies.\nI assure you that we will continue to proactively manage the NHP supply and reinforce our firm commitment to conducting ethical regulatory compliant business practices and to the humane treatment of the research model under our care.\nTo conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their support.\nNow I'd like Flavia to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2023 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, gains or losses from our venture capital and other strategic investments, a gain on the sale of the Avian Vaccine business and certain other items.\nMany of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022. My discussion this morning will focus primarily on our financial guidance for 2023.\nWe're very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which included revenue and earnings per share that outperformed our previous guidance, including quarterly revenue exceeding the $1 billion level for the first time. Our 2023 guidance ranges reflect multiple scenarios with regards to the estimated impact from the NHP supply constraint, as Jim outlined, the impact of which is expected to result in reported revenue growth of 1.5% to 4.5% and organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 7.5% in 2023.\nNotwithstanding the NHP supply situation, our outlook reflects sustained underlying trends in most of our businesses and a resilient funding environment. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $9.70 and $10.90, reflecting meaningful headwinds associated with both NHP supply and nonoperating items.\nI will not provide too many more comments on the NHP supply impact since Jim covered it. So I'll focus my comments on the other headwinds, which include the impact of the Avian Vaccine divestiture, a higher tax rate and increased interest expense.\nIn combination, these nonoperating headwinds will reduce earnings per share by approximately $1.20 to $1.40 for the year, partially offset by an FX benefit to earnings per share of up to $0.25 in 2023. These items will reduce earnings per share growth by nearly 10% at midpoint.\nI'd like to provide some additional details on the 3 nonoperating items that we expect will generate headwinds for our financial performance in 2023. First, we completed the Avian Vaccine divestiture in December as expected. The transaction will reduce 2023 revenue by approximately $80 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.25 net of the interest expense benefit since we used the proceeds to repay debt.\nSecond, the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to move to the top of our long-term low 20% range to 22.5% to 23.5% in 2023, representing a nearly 400-basis-point increase at midpoint compared to the 2022 tax rate of 19.2%. The increase will be primarily driven by a year-over-year reduction in the excess tax benefit related to stock compensation as a lower stock price will generate less of a benefit in 2023 compared to the prior year as well as discrete tax benefits in 2022 that are not expected to reoccur this year. The higher tax rate is expected to reduce 2023 earnings per share by $0.50 to $0.65 and the earnings growth rate by over 500 basis points at midpoint.\nFinally, total adjusted net interest expense in 2023 is expected to increase to a range of $133 million to $137 million compared to $105 million last year. We expect year-over-year increase will be driven by higher variable interest rates primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve's actions, partially offset by repayment of debt.\nWe anticipate the higher interest expense will create an earnings per share headwind of $0.45 to $0.50 and reduce the earnings growth rate by at least 400 basis points. As we mentioned last quarter, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effectively locking in a fixed rate for 2 years on $500 million of our revolving credit facility.\nAt year-end, approximately 3/4 of our $2.7 billion debt was at a fixed rate. We believe the Federal Reserve will increase rates in the near term, and our outlook accommodates an additional 100 basis point increase in rates in 2023 beyond the recently announced February increase.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, our gross and net leverage ratios were approximately 2.2x and 2.1x, respectively. This is a meaningful decline from the third quarter due in part to a cash gain on the Avian divestiture. We continuously evaluate our capital priorities and as always, intend to deploy capital to the areas that we believe will generate the greatest returns. Our outlook assumes an average diluted share count of approximately 51.5 million to 52 million shares outstanding in 2023.\nFrom a segment perspective, our 2023 revenue growth outlook reflects sustained client demand trends, offset by the NHP supply impact in the DSA segment. Similar to the prior year, the RMS segment is expected to achieve high single-digit organic revenue growth, the result of continued robust demand for research models and associated services. As a reminder, the Cambodian NHP supply situation does not have an impact on our RMS segment as these large models are sourced and used to support our Safety Assessment operation.\nFor the DSA segment, we expect the organic growth rate will be between low to mid-single digits based on our NHP supply assumptions around the timing of the resumption of imports. The Manufacturing segment is expected to generate low double-digit organic revenue growth with the increase from the 2022 growth rate principally driven by the expected rebound in the CDMO performance during the year.\nWhile foreign exchange was a 350-basis-point headwind in 2022, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since November is expected to result in a slight FX benefit of up to 50 basis points to revenue growth in 2023, assuming near current foreign exchange rates. This will drop down to a more meaningful contribution to the bottom line and is projected to generate up to a $0.25 earnings per share benefit due largely to movements in the Canadian dollar.\nYou may recall, in Canada, we invoiced most of our revenue in U.S. dollars, but essentially all of our costs are in current Canadian dollars. We have provided information on our 2022 revenue by currency and the foreign exchange rates that we are assuming for 2023 in our slide presentation.\nFor the operating margin, we would have expected to generate moderate margin improvement in 2023 without an NHP supply impact. But given this meaningful headwind, we expect the 2023 operating margin to be flat to down 150 basis points depending on the timing of the resumption of Cambodia NHP shipment.\nLonger term, we still believe there is operating margin improvement that is inherent in our business from a combination of leverage from higher volume, pricing and continuing to drive efficiency. We will not provide free cash flow or capital expenditure outlooks at this time because these metrics could vary based on the level of NHP supply impact that is incurred.\nFor 2022, free cash flow totaled $330.3 million compared to $532 million for the prior year. The decrease was due to higher CapEx as we added capacity to accommodate the robust demand as well as unfavorable working capital movements, the timing of which contributed to our free cash flow being below our prior outlook.\nCapital expenditures for 2022 increased by $96 million to $324.7 million with most of the increase driven by the continued capacity needs of the Safety Assessment business. Given the current NHP supply situation, we will reassess our capital needs for this year. Longer term, the targeted level for CapEx remains at approximately 9% of revenue as we expect to continue to invest in capacity in order to keep pace with a sustained underlying demand environment and support our long-term growth forecast.\nThe next slide shows a summary of our 2023 financial guidance. Looking at the first quarter of 2023, we expect that year-over-year revenue growth will be in the high single-digit range on a reported basis and at or above the 10% level on an organic basis.\nWe're expecting stronger revenue growth in the first half of 2023, both due to the comparisons to last year when growth accelerated throughout the year as well as the gating of the NHP supply impact. We expect only a small impact related to NHP supply in the first quarter because these large models are already in place to start the scheduled study.\nWe expect earnings per share will decline at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter compared to $2.75 in the first quarter of last year. In addition to the impact of the Avian divestiture, the nonoperating headwinds will have a greater impact to earnings per share in the first quarter, specifically higher tax rate and increased interest expense.\nAs previously mentioned, the tax benefit from stock compensation is expected to be lower in 2023 with the greatest impact in the first quarter. We also will now have anniversary last year's Federal Reserve more aggressive interest rate increases in the first quarter. These 2 items are expected to result in a combined earnings headwind of approximately $0.40 per share.\nIn addition, the Manufacturing segment faces a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year with regards to commercial readiness milestones in the CDMO business and Covid testing revenue in the Biologics Testing business. This will result in a lower growth rate for the Manufacturing segment in the first quarter. Each of these headwinds will improve throughout the year, beginning in the second quarter.\nIn conclusion, we're very pleased with our 2022 financial performance, and we'll proactively manage the challenges in 2023. We're confident in our ability to generate value for our shareholders by consistently growing revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nOver the last 5 years, we have achieved compound annual growth of 16% for revenue and 17% for earnings per share, generating robust operating and free cash flow while continuing to make necessary investments to support the growth of our business. We're focused on continuing to drive growth, executing our strategy and enhancing our position as the leading global nonclinical drug development partner, working with our clients from discovery and preclinical development through the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapies. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take your questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I am joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the third quarter of 2022. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions. There is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com.\nA webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through the next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about our third quarter results.\nOur solid financial performance was highlighted by a 15.3% organic revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.63, both of which exceeded our prior outlook. Third quarter organic growth rate accelerated 580 basis points from the second quarter level due primarily to the DSA segment, which delivered an outstanding growth rate to more than 20%, in line with our outlook since the beginning of the year. The DSA growth acceleration reflects continued robust price increases and meaningfully higher study volume in the Safety Assessment business, trends which have been supported by the strength of its backlog that continues to afford us with excellent visibility into the future client demand.\nThe strong operating performance against the backdrop of escalating macroeconomic pressures demonstrates the power of our unique portfolio which differentiates Charles River from other companies that provide R&D support services to the biopharmaceutical industry, especially from the late-stage clinical service providers. We are uniquely positioned as the leading global nonclinical drug development partner, working with clients from discovery and early-stage development through the safe manufacture of life-saving therapies.\nOur focus is centered on preclinical R&D which requires extensive scientific knowledge and the ability to innovate, understand and distinguished viable molecules from those that are not. Post pandemic, we are even more -- an even more essential partner to our biopharmaceutical clients because our core competencies are precisely tailored to their intensified focus on scientific breakthroughs, personalized medicine and speed-to-market.\nWith a comprehensive portfolio spanning small molecules, biologics and cell and gene therapies, we provide a flexible and efficient platform that accelerates early-stage biomedical research and therapeutic innovation. We are a leading global partner for outsourced discovery and regulated safety assessment services. We are also the largest provider of small research models and associated services that enable our clients to conduct their own research, and we offer a comprehensive portfolio of manufacturing solutions from quality control testing solutions to the production of cell and gene therapies that enable us to continue supporting our clients as they work with other providers to conduct human clinical trials and reach commercialization.\nWe have a large and diversified client base which makes us an exceptional barometer for the health of the broader biopharmaceutical industry. And unlike clinical providers, greatly reduces our reliance on a small group of clients. We have worked with more than 2,000 biopharmaceutical clients this year, and our top 25 clients are primarily large biopharmaceutical clients that are well-financed and have been a stable source of sustained revenue growth with accelerated spending in the third quarter. Our top 25 clients represented only 28% of total revenue last year, and our largest client represented just above 3% of total revenue.\nWe also believe that our biotech clients will remain a sustained growth engine for Charles River. We have averaged adding more than 400 new biotech clients per year since 2017 and are already above that level this year. Our biotech clients continue to be a principal driver of revenue growth, increasing at healthy double-digit growth rates in the third quarter and year-to-date, a trend that we believe supports our view that biotechs with promising molecules are continuing to find available funding.\nIn addition, we saw early indications of the return of IPOs and secondary offerings in the third quarter. Venture capital funding remained very healthy and large pharma continued to support the biotech industry. Our concentration of at-risk biotech remains low at approximately 5% of both DSA and total revenue for public biotechs with less than 2 years of cash on hand. This is slightly below our prior estimate, which evaluated DSA backlog.\nWe believe the early-stage research that we conduct is instrumental in our biotech clients' achievement of the important milestones that enable them to secure their next rounds of funding. And therefore, we believe they view continuing the regulated safety assessment programs as critical to their continued success. The total cost of the safety assessment program is a fraction of the cost of clinical trials, typically ranging from $6 million to $8 million including post-IND studies. Yet it is an important milestone to demonstrate that clients' efforts are driving innovation and validating the efficacy and safety profile of their lead compounds.\nAt 5 to 10x less than the cost of clinical trials, biotech clients are motivated to plan their spending around the achievement of IND approval before seeking additional funding or finding a larger biopharmaceutical partner to move into clinical trials. As a result of the importance, both biotech and larger biopharma clients are continuing to move their regulated safety assessment programs through their pipelines.\nI will now provide additional highlights of our third quarter performance. We reported revenue of $989.2 million in the third quarter of '22, a 10.4% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 15.3% exceeded our prior outlook of at least low double-digit increase. All 3 business segments reported solid revenue growth, particularly the DSA segment, due to the robust performance of the Safety Assessment business. The operating margin was 20.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points year-over-year. The decline was driven by lower margins in the Manufacturing and RMS segments as well as higher unallocated corporate costs, both of which were previously anticipated.\nEarnings per share were $2.63 in the third quarter, a decrease of 2.6% from the third quarter of last year. Higher revenue was offset by the operating margin decline, increased interest expense and a higher tax rate. Based on the third quarter performance, we are narrowing our 2022 revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the upper ends of the previous ranges. We expect organic revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $10.80 to $10.95.\nI'll now provide details on the third quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue for the DSA segment was $619.5 million in the third quarter, a 20.8% year-over-year increase on an organic basis. The DSA growth rate surpassed the 20% level, tracking to our initial plan that had forecast meaningful DSA growth acceleration throughout the year. The exceptional demand, which has manifested itself in sustained backlog growth is a function of our clients' robust pipelines, our competitive strengths and the scientific breadth and geographic reach of our portfolio.\nBroad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business was the principal driver of the nearly twofold increase in the DSA revenue growth rate from the second quarter level. The factors that led to this meaningful step-up were substantially higher study volume and continued meaningful price increases. Study volume was a significant contributor, driven by strong demand across the Safety Assessment business for most major study types of general and specialty toxicology. As expected, study volume rebounded meaningfully from first half levels, and we were able to accommodate additional client demand as a result of having hired and trained additional staff over the last year. We are continuing to successfully recruit and retain staff to support future growth and do not foresee challenges with staffing levels as we head into next year.\nPricing also continued to trend meaningfully higher year-over-year and sequentially, which we believe reflects the complexity and specialized nature of the work we do. Today's inflationary cost environment and the fact that capacity remains well utilized. Although pass-throughs are higher costs for certain study-related resources that are passed directly to clients were higher in the third quarter. They accounted for less than half of the sequential step-up in the Safety Assessment growth rate and had effectively no margin impact. Pricing, exclusive of the impact of pass-throughs, increased broadly in the third quarter.\nClients continue to emphasize the breadth of capabilities, study lead times and the availability of space more so than price when determining the preferred partner for their preclinical programs. As the premier partner for our clients' nonclinical development programs, it's not surprising that clients are continuously choosing to work with Charles River for our broad and scientifically differentiated portfolio, superior client service and speed as we aim to take an additional year out of the early-stage development timelines.\nAs expected, the Discovery Services growth rate moderated in the third quarter, primarily due to the lengthening of clients' decision-making time frames to start new projects, a trend which we discussed in August. We believe the Discovery business will demonstrate favorable long-term growth prospects as many of our clients, including biotechs, prefer to outsource their drug discovery projects rather than maintain in-house infrastructure. And given the critical importance of the early-stage research in which they are engaged, they prefer an integrated full-service partner like Charles River.\nWe continue to expect mid-teens DSA organic revenue growth in 2022. DSA backlog and booking activity through the third quarter continues to support sustained growth. And for next year, we have a significant amount of safety assessment work already booked.\nThe strong Safety Assessment performance has been under the leadership of Shannon Parisotto. Shannon has been with the company for over 20 years, starting at our Nevada site shortly after it became our first acquisition in the Safety Assessment space. With significant operational and finance experience, Shannon recently assumed responsibility of our Discovery Services in addition to Safety and was promoted to an Executive Vice President. I would like to congratulate Shannon and wish her continued success in driving the long-term growth of our Global Discovery and Safety Assessment segment.\nDSA operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 26.2% in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating leverage from the substantial quarterly increase in Safety Assessment study volume and pricing.\nRMS revenue was $180.1 million, an increase of 8% on an organic basis over the third quarter of 2021. The RMS business continued to sustain high single-digit growth, consistent with our outlook for the year. The RMS growth potential has trended upward recently from low to mid-single digits several years ago due to a combination of accelerating growth for Research Model Services and Research Models. The CRADL initiative, or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs including a recent Explora acquisition, is a significant driver of the growth rate increase. In addition, our renewed focus on biomedical research has led to increased demand and share gains for small research models, particularly in North America and China. We are also benefiting from meaningful price increases, in part to offset inflationary cost pressures. These factors were the principal drivers of RMS revenue growth in the third quarter.\nIn the Research Models business, North America continued to generate strong revenue growth and China rebounded following the impact from COVID-related restrictions in the second quarter. There was no meaningful impact on client order activity from COVID-related restrictions in the third quarter. We are also continuing to expand in China outside of Beijing and Shanghai regions to gain additional market share and believe the level of biomedical research activity, coupled with our expansion plans in China, will continue to generate robust double-digit growth in the region.\nResearch Model Services also had another excellent quarter, led by the Insourcing Solutions business, particularly our CRADL and Explora operations. Clients are increasingly adopting this flexible model to access laboratory space without having to invest in internal infrastructure.\nExplora has continued to perform very well with the integration on track. We added 5 new sites over the last 6 months in California and Washington state and now operate 27 vivarium facilities totaling over 370,000 square feet of turnkey rental capacity. CRADL and Explora provides us with a new and unique pathway to connect with clients at earlier stages, enabling these clients to easily access additional services across our comprehensive discovery and nonclinical development portfolio.\nIn the third quarter, the RMS margin declined by 260 basis points to 23.5%, driven primarily by the revenue mix and higher costs in China due in part to our regional expansions. We also experienced a modest margin impact from opening new CRADL and Explora sites this year for which the profitability will improve as client utilization increases in the newly opened sites.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $189.6 million, an increase of 6% on an organic basis. Lower revenue in the CDMO business, the drivers of which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by higher growth rates for both the Biologics Testing and Microbial Solutions businesses. The growth prospects for these legacy manufacturing quality control businesses remain robust, and they will continue to be principally driven by demand for biologic drugs, including cell and gene therapies, and other complex biologics.\nMicrobial Solutions benefited from broad-based growth across [Endosafe] endotoxin testing and Accugenix microbial identification testing platforms. We are continuing to convert the marketplace to our more efficient and reliable quality control testing platform. The continued expansion of the installed base of instruments drives demand for the consumable cartridges and reagents which provides a healthy recurring revenue stream.\nThe Biologics Testing business also had a strong quarter with virology, viral clearance and microbiology testing services driving growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Demand for traditional biologics remains strong, but cell and gene therapy clients are driving a disproportionate amount of recent growth.\nWe have been continuing to add capabilities to our extensive portfolio to support the manufacture of biologics, including the addition of new cell and gene therapy assays. The initiatives that we have implemented to improve the performance of our CDMO business are beginning to gain traction and earn positive feedback from clients.\nIt's still early, and we don't expect the financial performance to meaningfully improve until next year, but we're pleased with the initial progress. Our creation of Centers of Excellence for cell therapies, viral vectors and plasmids has been well received. And coupled with our focus on CDMO business development efforts, we are generating new client interest.\nWe recently announced a gene therapy manufacturing partnership with Nanoscope Therapeutics to produce plasmid DNA and viral vectors for their late-stage clinical trials of a therapy targeting degenerative ocular diseases. We have a number of other clients who are in late-stage clinical trials with their cell or gene therapies, and we are investing in our sites to ensure that we are commercially ready should our clients receive regulatory approval.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, our Memphis cell therapy site received European approval from the EMA to commercially manufacture cell therapy products. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for cell and gene therapies and are enhancing our service offering to generate new business and provide incremental opportunities for clients to streamline their biologics development workflows by utilizing Charles River for their analytical testing, process development and manufacturing activities.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 410 basis points to 28.6% in the third quarter of 2022. And similar to the second quarter, it was almost entirely driven by the CDMO business.\nAs we announced this morning, we have signed an agreement to divest our Avian Vaccine business, which is part of our Manufacturing Solutions segment for approximately $170 million in cash plus potential contingent payments of up to an additional $30 million. We routinely evaluate the strategic fit and fundamental performance of our global infrastructure. And as we did at this time last year, have sold or closed operations that did not meet our key business criteria.\nThe decision to divest the Avian business was consistent with this evaluation process as we determine the production of SPF eggs principally for Avian Vaccine manufacturers and researchers was no longer a core competency. Flavia will provide additional details on the financial impact of this transaction.\nWe are confident that we will finish the year on a strong note and are encouraged by the solid growth prospects as we head into the new year. The economy will present challenges in the coming year, but we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges and continue to deliver exclusive science, superior client support and greater efficiency to our clients.\nOur focus in recent years on enhancing our capabilities in biologics and cell and gene therapies, investing in our people and space and continuing to build greater digital connectivity with our clients has further differentiated us from the competition and enabled us to forge even deeper relationships with our clients. We are the bridge between the biopharmaceutical industry and patients that enables innovation to move forward and we will continue to distinguish ourselves scientifically and through our preclinical focus. To conclude, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their support.\nNow Flavia will provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance and 2022 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning.\nBefore I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, gains or losses from our venture capital and other strategic investments and certain other items.\nMany of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022. We're very pleased with our third quarter results, with revenue and earnings outperforming prior outlook. Organic revenue growth of 15.3% resulted in earnings per share of $2.63.\nI will now provide some additional details on the nonoperating items that drove our third quarter performance. Unallocated corporate costs increased in the third quarter, totaling $57.5 million or 5.8% of total revenue compared to 5% of revenue last year. The increase was primarily the result of higher health and fringe-related costs. For the year, we continue to expect unallocated corporate costs to be approximately 5% of total revenue.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense for the third quarter was $27.3 million, an increase of $4.4 million sequentially and $6.6 million year-over-year, reflecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases this year and on a year-over-year basis, higher debt balances from recent acquisitions. For the year, our total adjusted net interest expense outlook remains unchanged in the range of $106 million to $110 million because we expect that more aggressive interest rate hikes will be offset by additional debt repayment.\nOur current interest expense guidance can accommodate an additional 75 to 100 basis point increase, should that be the outcome of today's Federal Reserve meeting. Given the late timing of a potential December increase, we do not expect it would have a material impact on interest expense for 2022.\nThis week, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on $500 million of U.S. dollar-denominated debt on our revolving credit facility. For the next 2 years, the swap will effectively fix the interest rate at 4.7% plus our current spread of 112.5 basis points for a total of 5.825%. With the swap, approximately 2/3 of our $2.9 billion in debt is now at a fixed rate. Of the remaining floating rate debt, our revolving credit facility uses the 1-month LIBOR rate or equivalents plus the current spread.\nLooking beyond 2022 and to help with modeling in light of the Federal Reserve's current policy of more aggressive interest rate hikes, a 100-basis point increase in rates is expected to result in incremental interest expense of approximately $9 million on an annualized basis based on our remaining floating rate debt levels after the swap.\nOur gross and net leverage ratios were both approximately 2.7x at the end of the third quarter. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that strategic M&A will generate the greatest shareholder returns and enhance our growth potential. But in the near term, we'll also focus on shorter-term initiatives like debt repayment.\nAs Jim mentioned, we plan to divest our Avian Vaccine business by the end of the year. We'll receive gross proceeds of $170 million upfront and intend to redeploy that capital with a portion used to repay debt.\nThe third quarter GAAP tax rate was 20.2%, representing a 320-basis point increase from the same period last year. The higher tax rate year-over-year was due primarily to a lower tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation related to the lower stock price, as well as higher discrete tax benefits in 2021 associated with the R&D tax credit. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be approximately 20% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly below the outlook provided in August, and at the low end of our longer-term target of low 20%.\nFree cash flow was $60.4 million in the third quarter compared to $119.2 million last year. The 49% decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $72.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of nearly $17 million compared to the $55.5 million last year as we continue to make growth-related investments. For the year, our free cash flow and CapEx guidance remain unchanged at approximately $360 million and $340 million, respectively.\nAs Jim mentioned, we have narrowed our revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to the upper end of the prior ranges. We now expect reported revenue growth in a range of 10% to 11% for the full year, including the 350-basis point foreign exchange headwind that we forecasted in August. Our organic revenue growth outlook was also narrowed to a range of 11% to 12%.\nWe continue to expect that the consolidated operating margin will be essentially flat with 2021 and that we'll have narrowed our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.80 to $10.95 or approximately 4.5% to 6% growth versus the prior year. Excluding an estimated foreign exchange headwind of $0.43 this year as well as a $0.20 headwind from interest expense compared to our initial outlook, earnings per share growth would be in the low double-digit range this year.\nBy segment, our revenue growth outlook for 2022 remains unchanged. We expect organic revenue growth in the high single digits for the RMS segment, mid-teens for the DSA segment and mid-single digits for the Manufacturing segment.\nAs noted in this morning's press release, the Avian divestiture will not have a meaningful impact on our 2022 financial results. In 2023, the transaction will reduce annual revenue by approximately $80 million and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.35. But we expect to offset a portion of this dilution through the benefits of redeploying the proceeds towards other capital priorities.\nA summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 43. With 1 quarter remaining in the year, our fourth quarter outlook is effectively embedded in our full year guidance. I'd like to remind you that this year includes a 53rd week at the end of the fourth quarter to true up our fiscal year to a December 31 calendar year-end. The 53rd week historically has been characterized as a partial week of revenue and a full week of costs. And for 2022, we expect the impact will be a benefit to reported revenue growth of approximately 550 basis points for the fourth quarter and a modest operating margin headwind in the fourth quarter, particularly in the RMS segment.\nFor the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we expect reported revenue growth will be in the low to mid-teens and organic revenue growth will be at least in the low double-digit range. Earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of approximately $2.65 to $2.80 in the fourth quarter based on our updated full year guidance.\nIn conclusion, we are well positioned to finish the year on a strong note. The second half DSA growth acceleration is occurring as expected and our substantial backlog firmly supports our full year financial guidance. As we look to the future, we're focused on continuing to drive growth, executing on our strategy and enhancing our position as the leading global known clinical drug development partner, working with our clients from discovery and preclinical development through the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapies. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our comments. We will now take questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I'm joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the second quarter of 2022. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can also be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through the next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Our financial results reflect the sustained trends that continue to support our businesses and resulted in 9.5% organic revenue growth in the second quarter.\nThese trends were offset by headwinds from our CDMO business and foreign exchange, which were the factors that led to the revised second quarter outlook in early June, and coupled with interest rates, have intensified since then, leading to today's reduction in our revenue growth and earnings per share guidance for the full year.\nWe believe that our guidance for the year appropriately reflects the current macroeconomic environment with regard to foreign exchange, interest rates and cost inflation, which have changed dramatically since the beginning of the year.\nI would also like to note that our revised guidance does not reflect any meaningful slowdown in biotech client activity as biotechs continue to be the principal driver of revenue growth, and demand remains healthy. In fact, we are pleased that our DSA and RMS segments remain on track to achieve their initial revenue outlooks for the year of mid-teens and high single-digit organic growth, respectively.\nOur largest business, Safety Assessment, continues to benefit from a growing backlog that is well above the prior year level and solid booking activity. As usual, we continue to monitor key performance indicators and are having regular conversations with our biopharma clients whose spending patterns for the Safety Assessment programs to date remain largely unaffected by any change in biotech funding.\nOur Discovery Services business, which only represents about 15% of DSA segment revenue, is experiencing longer decision-making processes by some clients to initiate new projects. Before I provide more details on these trends, let me provide highlights of our second quarter performance and updated outlook for the year.\nWe reported revenue of $973.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 6.4% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 9.5% was driven by strong performances from the DSA and RMS segments, partially offset by a lower growth rate in the Manufacturing segment due to the CDMO performance. The lower-than-expected CDMO revenue reduced the organic revenue growth rate by slightly more than 100 basis points in the second quarter.\nThe operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by the DSA segment as well as lower unallocated corporate costs, reflecting actions we have taken to responsibly manage our expenses. Earnings per share were $2.77 in the second quarter, an increase of 6.1% from the second quarter of last year. Low double-digit operating income growth was largely offset by higher interest expense and tax rate compared to the prior year.\nSecond quarter earnings per share were in line with our revised outlook despite incremental pressure from the lower revenue from our CDMO business, the strengthening dollar and rising interest rates over the past 2 months. These factors are the primary reason for the reduction of our revenue growth and earnings per share guidance for the full year.\nWe now expect revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11% on a reported basis and 10% to 12% on an organic basis. For the year, foreign exchange is now expected to reduce the reported growth rate by 350 basis points or 200 basis points more than we forecast in May. And the lower-than-expected CDMO revenue is expected to be 150 to 175 basis point drag on the organic growth rate in 2022.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $10.70 to $10.95, which represents a reduction of $0.80 at the midpoint. Foreign exchange and interest expense have generated a combined headwind of approximately $0.40 since early June. Flavia will provide more details on these nonoperating items shortly.\nTempered expectations for our CDMO business in the near term are the primary driver of the remainder of the earnings shortfall and are a result of several factors. First, following last year's completion of a large COVID vaccine production contract at our Cognate U.K. site, we are retooling the production suites and retraining staff to return the capacity to its original purpose: producing plasmids, which is taking longer than expected.\nWe have also invested time and resources in preparing for regulatory audits and upgrading other sites to CGMP production quality. These actions will generate new business opportunities in the future, but they have had a near-term impact on the business.\nFurthermore, like the Early Discovery acquisition in 2014, the business development process for cell and gene therapy CDMO services is highly technical and scientifically complex, requiring longer lead times for clients to place new projects and partner with us across our expanded offering. We are making good progress bringing our cell and gene therapy services together and working towards these businesses becoming fully integrated within themselves and with our broader portfolio.\nWith regard to the integration of last year's Cognate and Vigene acquisitions, we have implemented a refined vision and a strategy for our combined CDMO business, which includes developing centers of excellence for plasmids at our Cognate U.K. operations; for viral vectors at Vigene in Rockville, Maryland; and for gene-modified cell therapy production in Memphis, Tennessee.\nWe believe this new structure will provide us with a distinct competitive advantage because it will enable us to optimize our internal processes and offer clients greater flexibility, efficiency and enhanced speed for their development and go-to-market efforts. We have also strengthened the management teams and are rebuilding the CDMO sales team, creating more contact points with clients as we endeavor to further strengthen the pipeline of new projects.\nWe are also adding new capabilities through modest facility expansions. As we announced in June, we are expanding our Alderley Park U.K. operation as part of our center of excellence for plasmid, and we are upscaling other sites for regulatory compliance and commercial readiness.\nWe are very pleased to report that our Memphis site was recently audited and approved by European regulatory authorities, or the EMA, to commercially manufacture cell therapies. This is a significant accomplishment that prepares us to undertake future commercial projects.\nWe are encouraged that these developments will help improve the performance of the CDMO business next year. Like Early Discovery, we believe our CDMO business is an integral part of our essential portfolio because it enables clients to access a comprehensive solution for cell and gene therapy research, development and production from one scientific partner.\nClients are continuing to require high-quality scientifically-differentiated solutions in the cell and gene therapy sector, and this will only intensify as more therapies are commercialized. As a result, we believe the CDMO growth opportunity remains robust, that we have the right scientific capabilities in place to be a uniquely ideal partner for our clients.\nI will now provide details on the second quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue for the DSA segment was $591.9 million in the second quarter, a 12.9% year-over-year increase on an organic basis. We are very pleased that the DSA organic growth rate improved by 340 basis points from the first quarter level and reached the low double-digit range, as previously expected. This performance reinforces our expectation that there will be meaningful DSA growth acceleration throughout the year.\nBased on demand and backlog trends, including working through higher pricing already booked, we continue to expect that the growth rate will approach 20% in the second half, tracking to our initial plan. Higher demand and meaningful price increases drove the sequential growth acceleration in the Safety Assessment business in the second quarter. The second quarter backlog increased on a sequential basis and also continued to be significantly above prior year levels. The backlog, coupled with solid booking activity in the second quarter, firmly supports our second half outlook.\nClients are emphasizing speed, study lead times and the availability of space today more so than price when determining which CRO to partner with for their preclinical programs. This year, several clients have chosen to secure space with us in a take-or-pay arrangement to reserve this study space in advance.\nWe anticipate that additional clients will agree to similar terms to secure space. Our speed and flexibility when working with clients, our superior client service and our broad scientific expertise continue to resonate with clients and differentiate us from the competition.\nWith our capacity well utilized both in terms of people and infrastructure, we continue to implement new operational initiatives and evaluate others to enhance labor utilization and infrastructure efficiency as well as study scheduling. We also believe that we are better positioned to accommodate the higher demand that we are forecasting in the second half of the year because of the significant number of staff that we hired over the past year.\nAnd because of the strong backlog, we believe that we have excellent visibility in the Safety Assessment business and are confident that the anticipated DSA growth acceleration will continue in 2022. For next year, we already have a large portion of our Safety Assessment revenue booked in the backlog.\nThe revenue growth rate for the Discovery Services business improved meaningfully from the first quarter level as expected. As I noted, we have experienced some lengthening in the time clients take to commit to and begin new projects. And given the shorter-term nature of the backlog and project cycles for this business, it's expected to slow the Discovery growth rate for the remainder of the year.\nOur technology partnership strategy has been a very successful means of broadening our portfolio since it has enabled us to continue to add cutting-edge scientific capabilities across many of our businesses with limited risk. We continue to believe our clients' willingness to outsource more of their Discovery programs will be predicated on our ability to provide them with innovative capabilities to meet their critical research needs.\nThe DSA operating margin increased by 180 basis points to 25.3% in the second quarter due to increased pricing and leverage from the investments in staff to support higher study volume. For the year, we continue to expect DSA operating margin will improve as the growth rate accelerates and we continue to leverage staffing investments.\nRMS revenue was $186.4 million, an increase of 8.5% on an organic basis over the second quarter of 2021 and in line with our high single-digit outlook for the year. Organic revenue growth was driven by strong demand and meaningful price increases in the Research Models business in North America as well as for Research Model Services, particularly Insourcing Solutions and GEMS.\nThe RMS growth rate did not improve from the first quarter level as previously anticipated due primarily to the Research Models business in China. Revenue for our China business increased, but due to COVID-related restrictions in the Beijing and Shanghai regions, the growth rate was limited and reduced the RMS growth rate by just under 200 basis points in the second quarter. These restrictions in China have now been eased, and the overall revenue impact will be modest, so RMS is still on track to achieve its outlook for the year.\nResearch Model Services also had another excellent quarter led by the Insourcing Solutions and GEMS businesses. Insourcing Solutions growth was driven by the CRADL initiative, or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs, which provides turnkey research capacity to small and large biopharmaceutical clients in key bio hubs.\nClients are increasingly adopting a flexible model to access laboratory space without having to invest in internal infrastructure. The acquisition of Explora BioLabs in April came at an opportune time, enabling us to provide clients with additional capacity and scientific capabilities, principally on the West Coast.\nIt also added a new growth engine for the RMS segment by allowing us to accommodate more of our biopharmaceutical clients' needs, particularly biotech clients who have limited or no internal infrastructure in which to conduct research. Demand for CRADL and Explora continues to be robust, and Explora had an excellent first quarter as part of Charles River.\nWe are continuing to expand the footprint of CRADL and Explora to support growth and have added new facilities in California and London in the second quarter, with the goal of operating at least 25 vivarium facilities with over 300,000 square feet of turnkey rental capacity by the end of 2022.\nCRADL and Explora also provides us with a new and unique pathway to connect with clients at earlier stages as these clients will be able to easily access additional services across our comprehensive discovery and nonclinical development portfolio. We are very pleased with the performance of this business and delighted to welcome Explora to Charles River.\nIn the second quarter, the RMS operating margin declined by 250 basis points to 24.9% driven primarily by the COVID-related revenue impact in China. Explora has healthy margins for service business and had an excellent second quarter, but it is expected to be a small margin headwind to the RMS segment for the remainder of the year as it continues to open new sites.\nRevenue from the Manufacturing segment was $194.8 million, an increase of 1% on an organic basis, reflecting lower revenue in the CDMO business as discussed as well as a challenging prior year comparison for the Biologics Testing and Microbial Solutions businesses, with a 26.6% segment organic growth in the second quarter of last year.\nBoth of these businesses are expected to generate revenue growth that approach their targeted levels for the year. The growth prospects for these legacy manufacturing quality control businesses remain robust, and they will continue to be principally driven by demand for biologic drugs, including cell and gene therapies and other complex biologics.\nCell and gene therapies will continue to be the primary growth driver for our Manufacturing segment, reflecting the rapid increase in the number of cell and gene therapy programs in development. Today, more than 3,000 cell and gene therapy programs are in the pipeline, a number which has grown at an average rate above 20% over the last 3 years.\nWith approximately 70% of programs in the preclinical phase and less than 5% of programs in Phase III clinical trials or later, we expect these advanced drug modalities will continue to fuel robust Biologic Testing growth and generate new business opportunities for the CDMO business, particularly as additional therapies reach commercial approval.\nWe believe our consolidated Biologics Solutions offering will provide incremental opportunities for clients to streamline their biologics development workflows and conduct their analytical testing, process development and manufacturing activities with Charles River.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 460 basis points to 28.6% in the second quarter of 2022, almost entirely driven by the CDMO business. We have taken actions to manage costs and investments both in the CDMO business and in other areas in order to limit the impact of the revenue shortfall for the year.\nWith regard to our company-wide capital priorities, we have built an excellent foundation for cell and gene therapy solutions since 2020 through M&A., and we will focus on integrating these enhanced scientific capabilities as well as all of our recent acquisitions. While we will still evaluate strategic acquisitions, we intend to focus on debt repayment for the remainder of the year.\nWe also continue to diligently monitor key performance indicators and modify plans for investments, including hiring and capacity expansions, should the growth prospects for business change. In this regard, we are strategically aligning our hiring and facility expansion plans for our CDMO business with the current and projected growth rate. Our goal is to balance the need to continue to make disciplined investments to support our growing businesses while responsibly controlling costs and enhancing value for our shareholders.\nWe have reset our financial outlook for 2022 to account for the escalating headwinds that have emerged throughout the year. We remain well positioned to deliver low double-digit organic revenue growth for the year and stable operating margins amidst today's challenging macroeconomic environment.\nFurthermore, we continue to believe that Charles River is a stronger company today than it has ever been and the partner of choice for our clients' nonclinical development needs. Clients are increasingly choosing to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, the scientific depth and breadth of our portfolio and our unwavering focus on seamlessly serving their diverse needs.\nWith that, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their support. Now Flavia will provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance and 2022 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related adjustments, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, gains or losses from our venture capital and other strategic investments, and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022.\nAs Jim mentioned, we delivered solid results in the second quarter, including 9.5% organic revenue growth and 100 basis points of operating margin improvement despite the challenges related to our CDMO business and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. These headwinds also led to the $0.80 reduction in our earnings per share guidance for the year to a range of $10.70 to $10.95, with half of the reduction resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange and interest expense since early June.\nSince we provided our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, nonoperating items, including foreign exchange and interest expense as well as lower-than-expected tax benefit from stock-based compensation, will reduce earnings per share by approximately $0.65 for the year. We expect to generate low double-digit organic revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% supported by strong trends in most of our businesses.\nWe also expect reported revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11%. As Jim mentioned, lower revenue in our CDMO business is expected to reduce our revenue growth by 150 to 175 basis points, and foreign exchange is expected to reduce the reported growth rate by an additional 200 basis points.\nJim spoke about the impact from the CDMO business, so I'll provide more details on foreign exchange and interest expense, which are expected to reduce 2022 EPS by approximately $0.40 since early June. The recent dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar has resulted in foreign exchange being more of a headwind than previously anticipated.\nSince we revised our outlook in early June, foreign exchange has reduced revenue by an incremental 200 basis points and earnings per share by nearly $0.25 for the year, assuming the near current spot rates in our guidance. The foreign exchange rates that we are assuming for the remainder of the year are included on Slide 31.\nThe Federal Reserve rate increases in mid-June resulted in a meaningful headwind to our 2022 earnings per share guidance. With approximately half of our $3 billion debt on a floating rate, rate increases will be the primary driver of the $8 million increase in our adjusted net interest expense for the year, which is now in a range of $106 million to $110 million.\nIn the second quarter, total adjusted net interest expense was $22.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million sequentially and $2.1 million year-over-year due primarily to higher debt balances from recent acquisitions and rate increases earlier in the year.\nThe current interest rate on our revolving credit facility are based on LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points spread at our current leverage. About 80% of our floating rate debt is denominated in U.S. dollars using the 1-month LIBOR rate. We have factored the Federal Reserve's 70 basis point increase in July into our updated outlook and have assumed that rates will increase by an additional 100 basis points before year-end.\nAt the end of the second quarter, our $3 billion outstanding debt balance represented a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x and a net leverage ratio of 2.7x. As Jim mentioned, we plan to focus our capital deployment priorities on debt repayment for the remainder of the year.\nI will now provide additional details on our financial performance and outlook. On a segment basis, our revised revenue growth outlook for 2022 primarily reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the impact of lower-than-expected revenue for the CDMO business.\nOn a reported basis, we now expect revenue growth rates for the Manufacturing segment in the high single-digit range, DSA in the low teens and RMS unchanged in the high single digits. Our organic revenue growth guidance for the DSA and RMS segments remains unchanged at mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Based on the previously mentioned headwinds, we have reduced our organic growth outlook for the Manufacturing segment to the mid-single digits.\nDespite the revised revenue outlook for the year, we expect consolidated operating margin to be essentially flat with 2021. We are appropriately managing costs to limit the margin impact and hold operating margin. We continue to expect the DSA segment will generate operating margin improvement in 2022.\nHowever, the RMS and Manufacturing operating margins are expected to be lower due to the impact of the Explora acquisition and the softer CDMO performance, respectively. Lower-than-expected CDMO results are forecasted to create a second half headwind of nearly 100 basis points to the consolidated operating margin.\nLower unallocated corporate costs contributed to the operating margin improvement for the second quarter. Corporate costs totaled 4.1% of revenue or $40.2 million compared to 5.6% last year, with a decrease primarily due to discretionary cost controls, reduced fringe-related costs and lower performance-based compensation costs. As a result, we now expect unallocated costs to be approximately 5% of total revenue for the year compared to our previous guidance of a mid-5% range.\nThe second quarter tax rate was 21.1%, representing a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. The increase was due to lower benefit associated with stock-based compensation resulting from the lower stock price, partially offset by discrete tax benefits. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate will be within the low 20% range on a non-GAAP basis, which is unchanged from the outlook we provided in May.\nThe cash flow was $66.6 million in the second quarter compared to $140.2 million last year. The year-over-year decrease of more than $70 million was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and unfavorable changes in working capital. Capital expenditures were $82.9 million in the second quarter compared to $46.4 million last year, primarily as a result of planned projects to accommodate future growth.\nBased on our lower earnings expectations for the full year, we have moderated our free cash flow guidance to approximately $360 million or $90 million below our prior outlook. We expect capital expenditures to decline by $20 million from our previous outlook to approximately $340 million in 2022.\nWe always strive to be disciplined with our capital investments and align extension plans with our growth outlook, which led to the modest reduction in CapEx for the year. We also remain confident on our future growth potential, so we intend to continue to appropriately invest in our growing businesses, particularly in Safety Assessment, which requires additional capacity to accommodate client demand.\nA summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 40. For the third quarter, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits on a reported basis, reflecting the incremental foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect at least low double-digit growth as a result of improvement in both the DSA and Manufacturing segments from the second quarter levels.\nThird quarter earnings per share is expected to decline to a high single-digit rate from last year's $2.70 due to margin pressure on the Manufacturing and RMS segments as well as meaningfully higher interest expense and tax rate, which is creating a combined $0.30 headwind compared to prior year.\nIn closing, we continue to be focused on the execution of our strategy, enhancing the speed and efficiency in which we operate and delivering solid financial and operational results in today's macroeconomic environment. We believe that significant growth potential continues to exist as our clients seek to find cures for unmet medical needs, and do so by using breakthrough technologies and new drug modalities that will only enhance demand for our leading nonclinical development solutions. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our comments, and we will now take questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Todd Spencer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome to Charles River Laboratories First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. This morning, I'm joined by Jim Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Flavia Pease, Executive Vice President and incoming Chief Financial Officer. They will comment on our results for the first quarter of 2022. Following the presentation, they will respond to questions.\nThere is a slide presentation associated with today's remarks, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.criver.com. A webcast replay of this call will be available beginning approximately 2 hours after the call today and can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The replay will be available through next quarter's conference call.\nI'd like to remind you of our safe harbor. All remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated.\nDuring this call, we will primarily discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe help investors gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and guidance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with Regulation G, you can find the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim Foster.\n\nJames C. Foster\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd. Good morning. We're pleased to report solid financial results for the first quarter that were precisely in line with our expectations. Organic revenue growth was slightly below the 10% level. Operating margin improved by 70 basis points year-over-year, and earnings per share growth was in the high single digits. Revenue growth rate is expected to increase from the first quarter level, positioning us well to achieve our robust outlook for the year.\nThere are several factors that we believe support our outlook, including the continued strength of the biopharmaceutical market environment. First, we continue to benefit from strong sustained business trends, particularly in our largest business, Safety Assessment, which represents approximately half of our total revenue. We are booking work well into 2023 and have over $1 billion of backlog already for next year. We continue to get price and anticipate continued share gains. Our scale, scientific expertise and geographic reach continues to resonate with our clients. We have added a significant number of staff in the second half of last year and continued hiring in the first quarter.\nCoupled with our growing backlog, we are poised to meet the escalating demand, which will result in a DSA organic revenue growth rate approaching 20% in the second half of this year. Another factor that supports our 2022 outlook is our well-funded client base, both large and small. Based on daily conversations with our clients and our key performance indicators, clients are continuing to spend at the rate that we anticipated and move their nonclinical development programs forward.\nGiven our early-stage focus, we are a canary in the coal mine, should funding become a concern. This is not surprising as we believe biotech clients are resilient and continue to have an average of about 3 years of cash on hand based on both our internal assessment and our clients' and industry sources.\nThe biotech industry is more critical to biomedical innovation than ever. Our clients are generally unaffected by the recent headlines related to public biotech financing. Beyond the public markets, we believe that broader balanced sources of funding will enable many biotechs to continue to access capital from the private sector.\nVenture capital funds continue to raise new larger funds and invest heavily in start-ups, providing a sustained source of funding for the biotech industry. We believe that pharma, M&A and partnering investments are also utilized to help ensure that promising molecules for unmet medical needs are funded and move forward.\nTo provide some color on our biotech client base, roughly 1/4 of our clients can be defined as precommercial. Segmenting that further, there is a subset of public biotech clients with less than 2 years of cash on hand. We estimate that these clients make up only about 10% of the current DSA backlog.\nWe have taken action in recent years to add staff capacity, scientific capabilities and secure resources to accommodate client demand and provide them with exceptional service. These efforts have intensified recently in order to support the robust growth that we are experiencing and continue to forecast. We are confident that we are taking the necessary steps to effectively manage the business in today's market environment and deliver on our commitments to clients. We believe that our ability to support our clients with flexible, efficient outsourcing solutions tailored to their needs and available when they need them has continued to distinguish us from the competition.\nI'll now provide highlights of our first quarter performance. We reported revenue of $913.9 million in the first quarter of '22, a 10.8% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth of 9.4% was driven by a solid performance from all 3 business segments and was in line with the outlook that we provided in February. Biotech clients continue to be the primary driver of revenue growth in the first quarter.\nThe operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by the RMS segment as well as lower unallocated corporate costs. Earnings per share were $2.75 in the first quarter, an increase of 8.7% from the first quarter last year. Strong mid-teens operating income growth was partially offset by a higher tax rate and interest expense compared to the prior year.\nBased on the first quarter performance and an expectation that the robust business trends will continue throughout the year, we are maintaining our organic revenue growth guidance of 12.5% to 14.5% and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance of $11.50 to $11.75 for 2022. Our guidance has incorporated 2 unfavorable changes in below-the-line items since the beginning of the year. The expectation for a slightly higher tax rate this year due to the impact of a lower stock price on stock-based compensation and higher interest expense as a result of the Federal Reserve's recent monetary policy changes. David will discuss both of these items in more detail shortly.\nI'd like to provide you with the details on the first quarter segment performance, beginning with the DSA segment. Revenue was $554.3 million (sic) [$544.3 million] in the first quarter, a 9.5% year-over-year increase on an organic basis. As expected, the DSA organic growth rate improved by nearly 300 basis points from the fourth quarter level driven by the Safety Assessment business. We expect that growth to improve to the low double digits in the second quarter and approach 20% in the second half as the quarterly gating for the year continues to track to our initial plan.\nThe Safety Assessment business continued to benefit from strong business trends as higher pricing and increased demand drove first quarter revenue growth. We are pleased with the sequential improvement in the Safety Assessment growth rate and expect continued acceleration during the year. This is supported by booking and proposal activity, which remained robust.\nDSA backlog was $2.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of more than 75% in the first quarter of last year and over 15% since year-end. Proposal dollar volume in the Safety Assessment business increased by 35% year-over-year. We also have an exceptionally high proportion of Safety Assessment revenues booked into backlog already for this year but do have sufficient capacity to start certain studies during the year. These trends reinforce our DSA organic revenue growth expectation for the year and affords us visibility into the strongest future demand that we have ever seen. Capacity is well utilized both in terms of people and infrastructure, and we are continuing to add the necessary staff and space to accommodate these robust demand trends.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we hired a significant number of Safety Assessment staff in the second half of last year, and hiring continued into the first quarter. With the staff now in place, we expect recent hires will help us meet our accelerating DSA growth outlook over the course of the year. Coupled with benefits from higher pricing, continuing to work through the backlog, we are very confident in the anticipated DSA growth acceleration and our ability to achieve our mid-teens DSA organic revenue growth outlook for the year, including approaching 20% growth in the second half.\nOur clients are also accepting longer lead times required to start some of their studies, which is necessitating that they book projects further in advance to ensure they do not delay their drug development. Many are exploring new creative relationships with us to secure space. These discussions recently led to a large biopharmaceutical client to enter into a multiyear agreement with us to reserve Safety Assessment capacity in a take-or-pay arrangement. We anticipate that other clients will follow suit and believe that these developments demonstrate the sustained strength of the demand environment and our market position as a leading nonclinical contract research organization.\nRevenue for the Discovery business increased in the first quarter, but growth rate was below its recent low double-digit trend. This was largely the result of difficult comparison to the strong first quarter of last year, which included milestone payments and some COVID-related work. Our integrated Discovery portfolio continues to resonate with clients, and it is imperative that we enable them to have access to cutting-edge scientific capabilities and expertise in major therapeutic areas as well as biologics so that we can be the scientific partner they work with to advance their research programs to IND filing and beyond.\nOur technology partnership strategy has been very successful means to do this, since it has enabled us to continue to add new capabilities across many of our businesses with limited risk. We believe our clients' willingness to outsource more of their Discovery programs will be predicated on our ability to continue to add innovative capabilities to meet their critical research needs.\nThe DSA operating margin decreased by 90 basis points to 22.9% in the first quarter due primarily to higher staffing costs. We view this largely as a timing issue given the significant number of new hires and wage environment over the past 6 to 12 months. For the year, we continue to expect that DSA segment will be the primary driver of modest operating margin improvement for the company as leverage from the accelerated DSA growth rate offsets higher compensation costs.\nRMS revenue was $176.5 million, an increase of 8.7% on an organic basis over the first quarter of '21 and in line with our high single-digit outlook for the year. Organic revenue growth was driven by broad-based demand and meaningful price increases in the Research Models business, particularly in North America, which performed very well. China also continued to perform well, but the growth rate was impacted by the comparison to the exceptionally strong start last year. We also experienced a very small RMS revenue impact related to China's COVID restrictions this year and are closely monitoring the situation. At this time, we don't expect it will become a meaningful headwind.\nResearch Model Services was also a significant contributor to the segment's growth led by the Insourcing Solutions business, or IS. Our CRADL, or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs initiatives, which is part of our IS business, has further accelerated the growth potential for the RMS segment as both small and large biopharmaceutical clients are increasingly seeking to rent turnkey research capacity in key biohubs.\nTo build upon our CRADL strategy and capitalize on the significant growth opportunity, we acquired Explora BioLabs last month. San Diego-based Explora has a similar focus as CRADL, currently operating more than 15 preclinical vivarium facilities with greater presence on the West Coast. While the demand for turnkey laboratory capacity makes this an attractive transaction on its own, the enhanced value proposition is that clients utilizing CRADL or Explora will be able to easily access additional services across our comprehensive discovery and nonclinical development portfolio, providing us with a new and unique pathway to connect with clients at earlier stages.\nWith expansions currently underway in the United States and internationally, the combined CRADL and Explora operation is expected to include at least 25 vivarium facilities by the end of '22, providing over 300,000 square feet of turnkey rental capacity in key biohubs. Explora BioLabs will effectively double the revenue and footprint of our CRADL operation, driving strong double-digit revenue growth that will solidify the RMS segment's position as a sustained growth engine for the company.\nIn the first quarter, the RMS operating margin increased 120 basis points to 29.9%, driven primarily by operating leverage from robust sales of research models. RMS operating margin expansion will be limited for the remainder of the year due to the Explora BioLabs acquisition. Explora has healthy margins for service business, but the operating margin is below that of the RMS segment, creating a headwind to the segment margin this year. Explora is opening a number of new sites this year, so we expect the business to leverage these investments and be better positioned to enhance its operating efficiency thereafter.\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $193.1 million, a 10.1% increase on an organic basis over the first quarter of last year. Biologics Testing Services was the primary driver of the increase, with continued robust double-digit revenue growth. Microbial Solutions' growth rate was below the 10% level, resulting in the Manufacturing segment's growth rate being below its mid-teens full year target in the first quarter. This was timing-related and will not affect the outlook for the year as we still expect Microbial revenue growth in the 10% range.\nDemand for our Biologics Testing Services associated with cell and gene therapies and other complex biologics continues to be robust, and we are confident that cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers for our business, even as COVID-related vaccine testing revenue settles into a steady run rate.\nThere is a significant market opportunity for our Biologics Testing business, which provides services that support the safe manufacture of biologics, including process development and quality control. We believe client interest in our consolidated Biologics Solutions offering, which provides both biologics testing and the cell and gene therapy CDMO services, will only increase as the synergies to produce complex biologics and conduct required analytical testing with one scientific partner are more broadly adopted by clients. Utilizing our Biologics Solutions offering will be a strategic advantage for clients who are looking to reduce bottlenecks and increase efficiency of their drug development and commercialization efforts.\nOur CDMO business also had a good quarter, and we continue to make excellent progress on our integration efforts. Our gene-modified cell therapy production business has gained traction and generated strong growth in the quarter as it continues to be one of the leaders in this emerging space. We benefited from commercial readiness milestones in the quarter, which are relatively common in the CDMO sector, and demonstrate that clients are continuing to advance their programs into later stages of development and trust us to take the critical next steps with them. We also continue to position our gene therapy product offering, plasmid DNA and viral vectors, to be opportunistic in a marketplace that is greatly in need of more supply.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined 240 basis points to 33.1% in the first quarter of '22 as a result of the inclusion of the Cognate and Vigene businesses, which have margins below the overall segment, but expected to improve as we drive efficiency and leverage, there's significant growth potential for this business.\nWe are operating in a robust business environment that gives us excellent growth potential. We have the best visibility that we have ever had with an average 12 to 18 months of backlog in our largest business. We have the capacity and the people in place to deliver on the accelerated demand throughout the year, and we are benefiting from escalating pricing. It is opportune that the market dynamics will remain robust at a time when we believe we have built the premier, nonclinical contract research and manufacturing organization.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to provide an update on our CFO transition plan. As we announced last month, Flavia Pease has been named our next Chief Financial Officer, replacing David Smith, who previously announced his plans to retire. I'd like to thank David for his dedicated service to Charles River and a remarkable career. David has been instrumental in Charles River's growth and success since he joined the company through the Argenta and BioFocus acquisition in 2014 and subsequently when he was promoted to Chief Financial Officer in 2015.\nDuring his tenure as CFO, Charles Rivers revenue has increased 17% annually and free cash flow by 14% annually, and David has played a critical role in these accomplishments by providing strategic financial counsel and direction to our global organization. David will remain with us through year-end by transition into a role of Senior Financial Adviser shortly after earnings.\nI'm pleased to announce that Flavia Pease will assume the role of CFO at that time. Flavia is a highly regarded financial leader with more than 20 years of financial leadership experience at Johnson & Johnson. Her deep biopharmaceutical industry knowledge and experience managing the finance organizations of large, growing businesses will greatly benefit Charles River. I look forward to partnering with Flavia as we work to advance the company's growth strategy and mission.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment and our clients and shareholders for their support.\nNow Flavia will provide a brief introduction before David gives you additional details on our first quarter financial performance and '22 guidance.\n\nFlavia H. Pease\n\nCorporate EVP, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. I'm excited to join the Charles River family and become Chief Financial Officer. Charles River presents a compelling opportunity to join a life sciences industry leader, work with a deep and talented finance team and collaborate with experienced senior leaders. I intend to leverage my experience as a trusted business partner to help the company achieve its financial goals, support it's significant growth potential and create value for shareholders.\nI look forward to meeting many of you in the investment community in the coming weeks and months. I would also like to thank David for his support and guidance over the past few weeks, and I will continue to work closely with him to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.\nNow I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Ross Smith\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, Flavia, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022.\nWe are pleased with our first quarter performance, which included revenue and earnings per share growth in line with the outlook we provided in February. Organic revenue growth of 9.4% and operating margin expansion of 70 basis points were partially offset by a higher-than-expected tax rate resulting in an earnings per share increase of 8.7% to $2.75.\nAs Jim mentioned, we have reaffirmed our organic revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full year. Our earnings per share guidance of $11.50 to $11.75 has effectively absorbed a higher-than-expected tax rate and interest expense compared to our initial outlook. I will discuss both of these items in more detail shortly.\nOur organic revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged at 12.5% to 14.5% growth. With the addition of Explora BioLabs, we've increased reported revenue growth guidance to a range of 13.5% to 15.5%. This includes a larger 1.5% headwind on foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Given the robust top line performance, we remain well positioned to modestly expand the operating margin in 2022.\nAs I mentioned, our tax rate and interest expense outlooks have increased since the beginning of the year. We expect a slightly higher tax rate in 2022 because of the lower stock price during the first quarter resulted in a lower excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. This led to a first quarter tax rate of 16.8%, a 230 basis point increase year-over-year and above our prior outlook in the mid-teens.\nOur tax outlook remains within our initial low 20% range for the year but has moved slightly higher due to the stock price movement since February. We now expect adjusted interest expense of $98 million to $102 million in 2022, approximately $15 million higher than our prior outlook. The primary drivers of the increase are nearly evenly split between higher interest rate assumptions associated with the Federal Reserve's outlook provided in March and higher debt balances due to the Explora acquisition in April, which will not have a meaningful impact on non-GAAP earnings per share since the transaction is expected to be earnings-neutral this year.\nFor the first quarter, total adjusted net interest expense was $20.4 million, which were flat sequentially compared to the fourth quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.7 billion, equating to a gross leverage ratio of 2.5x and a net leverage ratio of 2.4x. As planned, we financed the Explora acquisition through our revolving credit facility, and our leverage remains below 3x pro forma for the transaction.\nFor the remainder of 2022, we will continue to evaluate M&A opportunities, and absent any additional acquisitions, our capital priorities will be focused on debt repayment.\nBy segment, our organic revenue growth outlook for 2022 remains unchanged. RMS organic revenue growth guidance remains in the high-single digits. The reported revenue growth outlook for this segment is being increased to a high single-digit range to include the Explora revenue contribution. We continue to expect the DSA segment to deliver mid-teens organic revenue growth driven by strong contributions from both the Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses. And the Manufacturing segment to achieve mid-teens organic growth as the Microbial Solutions growth rate improves from the first quarter level and the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions are included in the organic growth rate.\nLower unallocated corporate costs totaling 5% of revenue contributed to the first quarter operating margin improvement. This is compared to 6.2% of revenue last year, with the decrease driven by several factors, including favorable fringe-related costs and quarterly fluctuations in the gating of corporate costs. Despite the favorability in the first quarter, we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in the mid-5% range as a percent of revenue for the full year.\nFree cash flow was $22.2 million in the first quarter compared to $142.2 million last year. A decrease of $120 million over the prior year was primarily due to planned increase in capital expenditures associated with projects to support future growth and higher performance-based bonus payments related to the strong 2021 results. Capital expenditures were $80.5 million in the first quarter compared to $28 million last year. For the year, our free cash flow and CapEx guidance remain unchanged at approximately $450 million and $360 million, respectively. As previously discussed, CapEx is expected to total approximately 9% of total revenue in 2022.\nA summary of our updated financial guidance for the full year can be found on Slide 39. For the second quarter, our outlook reflects a continuation of the strong business trends and for the revenue growth rate to continue to accelerate. We expect the reported and organic revenue growth rates will be in low-double digits. The DSA and RMS organic growth rates are expected to improve sequentially from the first quarter level, while the Manufacturing segment will be slightly lower due to the strong comparison to the nearly 27% growth last year. Earnings per share are expected to increase in the mid- to high-single digits year-over-year in the second quarter.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter financial performance and are confident about our growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Given the strong DSA business development activity that Jim highlighted, our order book firmly supports our full year financial guidance, including DSA organic revenue growth approaching 20% in the second half of the year.\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a few final words. I'm pleased to welcome Flavia to the Charles River team. In the past few weeks, we've begun the transition of my responsibilities. And as such, this will be my final earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. I'm not officially retiring until after year-end but I will move into a new role shortly after this earnings call to ensure a smooth transition.\nIt has truly been a privilege to serve as Charles River's CFO, and I would like to thank Jim, the Board and all of my colleagues for their support and collaboration during my time at Charles River and for the successes that we have all shared together. I firmly believe I am leaving the company well positioned for continued success because of the sustained, robust demand environment, our industry-leading portfolio and the highly experienced leadership team.\nI would also like to thank each of you, the Charles River shareholders and analysts, for the collaborative relationships that we have forged over the years and for your support. It's been a pleasure working with you. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our comments. Operator, we will now take questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you.

Foster\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nGood morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about another exceptional year for Charles River and our expectations for 2022. We believe that Charles River is a stronger company today than it has ever been. We were extremely pleased to report organic revenue growth of 15% for the full year or low double-digit growth when normalizing for the COVID-19 impact in 2020 and a second consecutive year of 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. We are seeing unprecedented demand across most of our businesses, and we believe that this demand, coupled with robust industry fundamentals, will fuel low teens revenue growth in 2022.\nAs a result, we're continuing to invest to add people and capacity to accommodate growing client demand and to build a scalable operating model to enhance our scientifically distinguished portfolio and to strengthen our relationships with clients through our flexible, efficient outsourcing solutions.\nTo further differentiate ourselves from the competition, we have strategically expanded our portfolio to provide clients with the critical capabilities they require to discover, develop and safely manufacture new drugs. We have enhanced our scientific capabilities for advanced therapies in areas that offer significant growth potential with 6 acquisitions over the past 2 years. By doing so, we have built an end-to-end nonclinical portfolio of cell and gene therapy solutions to support clients from early-stage research through cGMP production, and we expect it to generate nearly 15% of our total revenue in 2022.\nThe greater complexity of scientific research is encouraging the biopharmaceutical industry to rely on Charles River's high science capabilities when choosing an outsourcing partner. Because of our extensive scientific expertise, client-centric approach and unique nonclinical portfolio, we worked on more than 85% of the FDA-approved drugs in 2021, including all of the CNS drugs and more than 90% of the oncology drugs. We are proud that our biopharmaceutical clients continue to choose to partner with us as they recognize the value that we provide.\nNow let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year. We reported revenue of $905.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 14.4% on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 10.5% was driven primarily by continued double-digit growth in the Manufacturing and RMS segments. The COVID impact in 2020 resulted in a modest 50 basis point increase to the organic revenue growth rate.\nFor 2021, revenue was $3.54 billion, with a reported growth rate of 21.1% and organic growth rate of 15.1%. On an annual basis, the COVID impact in 2020 resulted in a 280 basis point increase to the organic revenue growth rate. Adjusted for the COVID impact, we were very pleased that we achieved low double-digit normalized growth on a consolidated basis, and that each segment achieved its longer-term organic growth target in 2021.\nThe operating margin was 20.9% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, we met our outlook of 21%, representing the second consecutive year of 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. This demonstrates the operating leverage inherent in our business as well as our continued efforts to drive operating efficiency and build a more scalable infrastructure. We expect to generate modest operating margin improvement in 2022, which will moderate from the past 2 years as we continue to make the investments needed to support growth principally related to staffing and because of a 20 basis point headwind from the 53rd week this year.\nEarnings per share were $2.49 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 4.2% from $2.39 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Strong revenue and operating income growth were partially offset by a higher tax rate and interest expense. For the full year, earnings per share were $10.32, a 26.9% increase over the prior year. We exceeded our prior guidance range of $10.20 to $10.30 and reported a second consecutive year with earnings growth above the 20% level.\nOur outlook for 2022, which we initially provided in January, demonstrates our firm belief that the sustained demand environment will continue this year. We believe this trend, combined with higher pricing, will drive organic revenue growth in the range of 12.5% to 14.5% in 2022. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share will be in a range of $11.50 to $11.75.\nEarnings per share are expected to grow at a similar rate to revenue as modest operating margin improvement will be largely offset by less favorable below-the-line items, including a higher tax rate. We are enthusiastic about the year ahead and look forward to new opportunities to scientifically differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, enhance our ability to meet customers' needs and achieve our financial goals.\nI'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our expectations for 2022, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter was $534.1 million, a 6.7% increase on an organic basis. Biotechnology clients remain the primary driver of DSA growth in the fourth quarter as the industry remains well funded and ended the year on a strong note.\nAs anticipated, the DSA segment's organic growth rate for the quarter was below 10%. But also as expected, DSA achieved a low double-digit growth rate for the year at 12.2%. As we have said before, growth rates for our businesses are not linear, so quarterly fluctuations should be expected.\nIn 2022, we expect DSA organic revenue growth will be in the mid-teens. The increase from last year's growth rate is based on our belief that sustained client demand will continue and higher price increases than in 2021 will help offset higher compensation costs and other inflationary cost pressures. The DSA growth rate is expected to accelerate during 2022, due in large part to the current pricing working through the backlog. First quarter growth rate is also expected to improve from the fourth quarter level.\nOur Safety Assessment business continued to perform very well, benefiting from strong demand and price increases. Bookings and proposal volume remain at record levels, with total DSA backlog increasing 70% or by $1 billion to $2.4 billion at year-end 2021. We are booking work into 2023, which translates to greater visibility and a strong book of business that supports our growth expectations.\nThe acceleration of demand during 2021 was reflected in the fact that we added nearly twice as many safety assessment staff in the second half of 2021 as we did in the first half. We expect these recent hires will help us accommodate client demand in 2022.\nIn addition to closely managing the workload by continuing to add staff, we are taking a similar approach to capacity additions, investing in new space in a disciplined manner to ensure we meet future demand. Our Discovery Services business also continued to perform well, with strong performances for early discovery and CNS services.\nSimilar to the Safety Assessment business, we are accommodating robust client demand for Discovery Services by closely managing staffing levels and adding cutting-edge capabilities. We believe this will continue to enable us to achieve our annual growth rate in the low double digits or better.\nOur efforts to broaden and strengthen our discovery capabilities and enhance our scientific expertise are enabling us to expand the support we provide for our clients' discovery research. As a result, clients increasingly view Charles River as a premier scientific partner who can support their efforts to identify new drug targets and discover novel therapeutics.\nThis is leading to new opportunities for our Discovery business, including significant client interests in integrated drug discovery programs, in which clients trust us with multiple services or their entire discovery program to advance their early-stage therapies. We intend to continue to build our Discovery portfolio, including through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\nAcquired in early 2021, Retrogenix, with its proprietary cell microarray technology and off-target screening services, had a very successful first year as part of the Charles River family. Combined with Distributed Bio's large molecule discovery platform, clients can now partner with us for integrated end-to-end solutions for therapeutic antibody and cell and gene therapy discovery and development. Our partnership strategy has proven to be a successful approach to staying current with cutting-edge technologies and adding innovative capabilities with limited upfront risk.\nWe recently signed a new partnership with Valo Health to deliver a new type of offering that combines Valo's artificial intelligence, or AI-enabled drug discovery and development platform, with our own capabilities to expedite the discovery of small molecule therapies for clients. This partnership has the potential to accelerate the discovery process as we utilize Valo's Opal closed-loop, in silico platform to rapidly identify compounds and optimize them using our leading in vitro and in vivo capabilities.\nWe also recently announced an expanded partnership with SAMDI-Tech's innovative assay technology to further expedite the discovery process around high throughput screening of lead compounds. Our innovative discovery toolkit will enable us to become a technological disruptor in the industry and positions us as an indispensable research partner who can enable clients to identify and discover new drugs faster, which will ultimately reduce their time to market.\nThe DSA operating margin was essentially unchanged at 23.1% in the fourth quarter, despite a 40 basis point headwind related to foreign currency translation. For 2021, the DSA operating margin improved by 30 basis points to 23.7% and foreign exchange has an 80 basis point headwind. The DSA segment is expected to be the primary contributor to the company's operating margin improvement in 2022.\nRMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $165.6 million, an increase of 13.3% on an organic basis, which excludes the RMS Japan divestiture. In comparison to the COVID impact in 2020 increased the fourth quarter growth rate by 23%. For the year, RMS organic revenue increased by 19.5% with approximately half the increase or 9.8% being driven by the comparison to the COVID impact in 2020. Normalized for the COVID impact, we reported high single-digit growth in 2021, which is consistent with the RMS organic growth outlook for 2022.\nOur 2022 outlook reflects a continuation of the strong global demand for research models and associated services generated by the ongoing robust early stage research activity within the biopharmaceutical industry as well as at academic and government institutions. This outlook includes robust growth for our Insourcing Solutions business as we continue to expand our cradle footprint. It also assumes improvement in the cell supply growth rate throughout 2022 as our efforts to enhance the operating performance of HemaCare and Cellero gained traction during the year. The underlying industry fundamentals within the cell therapy sector remains strong.\nResearch models remained foundational regulatory required tools for early-stage research and toxicology and a vital component of our ability to support our clients. Revenue for research models has increased globally during the COVID-19 pandemic due to both higher pricing and improved demand, reflecting the renewed focus on scientific innovation and the critical role that research models play in generating scientific breakthroughs and ensuring the safety of life-saving therapy.\nDemand in China was exceptionally strong in 2021, reflecting the resurgence of biomedical research activity following China's emergence from COVID-related shutdowns in 2020 as well as a shift towards a mid-tier biopharma and CRO client base and our expanded product offering.\nWhile we expect the growth rate in China will moderate in 2022, including in the first quarter after an exceptionally strong start last year, we are continuing to expand our geographic footprint to support the continued double-digit revenue growth that is expected in this region. The heightened level of research activity is also driving demand for our research model services, which continued to perform very well in the fourth quarter and full year.\nWe are a natural partner for GEMS and Insourcing Solutions, or IS, with our extensive animal husbandry expertise and our ability to provide clients with flexible and efficient solutions. GEMS is benefiting from strong outsourcing demand, driven by the greater complexity of scientific research and the proprietary models that our clients are creating. IS is benefiting from the continued growth of our CRADL initiative, which provides both small and large biopharmaceutical clients with turnkey research capacity at our sites and facilitates the use of other Charles River services as the research progresses.\nWe intend to continue to expand our existing CRADL footprint in the Boston, Cambridge and South San Francisco biohub, and also into new regions in 2022, including Southern California and China, due to significant client interest in this service. The RMS operating margin was 26.9% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 180 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe increase was driven by operating leverage from higher sales volume in the Research Models business, particularly in China. For 2021, the RMS operating margin increased by 530 basis points to 27.3%. The significant improvement was primarily due to the comparison to the depressed margin in 2020 associated with COVID-related client disruptions.\nManufacturing revenue was $205.3 million in the fourth quarter, a growth rate of 21.2% on an organic basis, driven primarily by double-digit organic growth across the Microbial Solutions, Biologics testing and Avian Vaccine businesses. For the full year, organic revenue growth was 20.6%, with 210 basis points of the increase coming from the comparison to the COVID impact in 2020.\nIn 2022, we expect mid-teens organic growth for the Manufacturing segment. The moderation from the exceptional '21 performance reflects a return to more normalized growth rates for the Microbial Solutions business after an incremental benefit from COVID-related instrument and cartridge replenishments in '21 and in the Biologics Testing business, due to a reduction in some COVID vaccine testing revenue, as that revenue stream settles into a steadier state.\nWe're very pleased with the mid-teens growth rate forecast for 2022 and expect the Manufacturing segment will achieve its 2024 target of approaching 20% growth once the benefit of the high-growth CDMO business is fully reflected in the organic growth rate and the CDMO scale continues to increase.\nMicrobial Solutions growth rate in the fourth quarter and for the year remained well above 10%, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio of critical quality control testing solutions. We were pleased with the strength of the demand for our endotoxin testing systems and cartridges, which performed FDA-mandated light release testing on injectable drugs and medical devices.\nThe advantages of our comprehensive portfolio continue to resonate with our clients. And we believe that our ability to provide a total microbial solution will enable Microbial Solutions to continue to deliver revenue growth at or above the 10% level.\nThe Biologics Testing business reported another exceptional quarter and year of strong double-digit revenue growth. Robust demand for cell and gene therapy testing services continue to be the primary growth driver, with COVID-19 vaccines and traditional biologics also being meaningful contributors. While we expect the moderation of the COVID vaccine testing revenue in 2022, we believe cell and gene therapies will continue to be significant growth drivers over the longer term to support our 20% target for the Biologics business this year and beyond.\nOur CDMO business is continuing to make great progress on the integrations as we gain traction on business development activities to support its robust growth outlook in 2022. We've established an end-to-end gene-modified cell therapy solution, which we believe is critical to support our clients more seamlessly.\nOur comprehensive cell and gene therapy portfolio is resonating with clients, and they continue to explore opportunities to streamline their biologics development workflows and drive greater efficiencies by outsourcing to us. The strength of demand for CDMO services necessitates our continued investment in capacity to ensure we have available space to serve our clients and to build upon our extensive portfolio of manufacturing services.\nThe Manufacturing segment's operating margin declined by 160 basis points to 35.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and by 320 basis points to 34.2% for the full year. These declines primarily reflect the inclusion of the CDMO acquisitions in 2021 of Cognate and Vigene. These businesses are profitable, but their margins are below overall Manufacturing segment. We expect this margin headwind to gradually dissipate as we drive efficiency and as a significant growth we anticipate generates greater economies of scale and optimize the throughput at our CDMO sites.\nIn 2022, we will continue to move our growth strategy forward. Disciplined M&A and strategic partnerships remain vital components of our strategy as we endeavor to further enhance the scientific expertise, global reach and innovative technologies that we can offer clients across all 3 of our business segments. We will also focus our efforts internally on ensuring that we have the necessary staff and resources to meet the needs of our clients and support the robust growth in our markets, on enhancing our real-time digital connectivity with clients and on continuing to integrate our end-to-end nonclinical offering to create a more seamless solution across all drug modalities.\nIt's incumbent upon us to be the scientific partner who can help clients move their programs forward from concept, to nonclinical development, to the safe manufacture of their life-saving therapy. By providing exceptional value to our clients, we believe we will continue to achieve our financial targets and deliver greater value to our shareholders.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to thank our clients and shareholders for their support and our employees for their exceptional work and commitment.\nNow I'd like David Smith to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2022 guidance.\n\nDavid Ross Smith\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, the gain on the sale of RMS Japan, our venture capital and other strategic investment performance and some of those items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in 2022.\nMy discussion this morning will focus primarily on additional details regarding our financial guidance for 2022, which was originally provided on January 11. We continue to expect reported revenue growth of 13% to 15% in 2022 and organic revenue growth of 12.5% to 14.5%.\nOur revenue growth outlook for 2022 is supported by the continuation of unprecedented client demand and a healthy funding environment, along with price increases to help offset higher inflationary cost pressures. We remain well positioned to expand margins, while continuing to invest in the business, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.50 and $11.75 per share or approximately 11% to 14% growth compared to 2021.\n(inaudible) our outlook is also unchanged from last month. We expect organic revenue growth in the high single digits for the RMS segment, the result of continued robust global demand for research models and associated services as well as improvement in the cell supply growth rate. This will be partially offset by a moderation in the RMS China growth rate after an exceptional performance in 2021.\nIn the DSA segment, we expect mid-teens organic revenue growth, driven by continued strong contributions from both the Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses. The growth rate of the Safety Assessment business is expected to accelerate during the year, principally as current pricing works through the backlog.\nWe also expect mid-teens organic revenue growth in the Manufacturing segment, reflecting a slight moderation in the Microbial Solutions and Biologics growth rate, along with the incremental contribution from the high-growth cell and gene therapy CDMO business once we anniversary the Cognate and Vigene acquisitions.\nThe CDMO business is expected to contribute nearly 150 basis points to our consolidated organic revenue growth rate in the second half of the year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to provide a headwind of approximately 100 basis points to our reported revenue guidance in 2022 as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nFX rate estimates are based on the bank forecast for the year, which are currently very close to spot rates on those currencies. Based on our current rate assumptions, FX will be a moderate headwind to earnings per share. We have provided information on our 2021 revenue by currency and the foreign exchange rate that we are assuming for 2022 on Slide 32, and we'll continue to monitor fluctuations in the currency market as we progress through the year.\nWe were pleased with the operating margin of 21% last year and the fact that it was the second consecutive year with 100 basis points of margin improvement. We remain well positioned to drive modest operating margin improvement in 2022, although the improvement will be less than the prior 2 years due to 2 principal factors: higher compensation costs due to both hiring and wage increases and the impact of the 53rd week, which is expected to reduce the operating margin by approximately 20 basis points.\nOn a segment basis, the DSA operating margin is expected to be the primary contributor to the margin improvement in 2022 as leverage from higher revenue growth is expected to drive the operating margin towards its longer-term target in the mid-20% range. Corporate expenses are expected to be in the mid-5% range at or slightly below the 2021 level of 5.6% of our total revenue. We expect unallocated corporate expenses to be a small contributor to the margin expansion this year because of our scalable infrastructure and investments, including in our digital enterprise, enable us to drive greater efficiencies and leverage corporate costs.\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for 2022 is expected to be in the low 20% range, which will be a slight increase from 18.9% in 2021. The increase is principally due to the discrete tax benefit in 2021 associated with R&D tax credits and a favorable excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, neither of which is expected to occur at the same level. Our 2022 tax rate guidance assumes no impact from potential U.S. tax reform initiatives at this time.\nAs a reminder, the first quarter tax rate has been meaningfully lower in recent years, due primarily to the excess tax benefit related to stock compensation. Given our current stock price, we expect this to continue to be true in 2022, resulting in a non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens for the first quarter.\nTotal adjusted net interest expense in 2022 is expected to increase to a range of $83 million to $87 million compared to $79 million last year. We expect the year-over-year increase to be driven by the outlook for higher variable interest rates, primarily in the U.S., partially offset by repayment of debt.\nOur assumptions by interest rates include several rate increases this year, which is generally consistent with the Federal Reserves guidance. It is important to note that the interest rate impact will be somewhat muted the fact that slightly more than 50% of our debt is in fixed rate funds that will not fluctuate.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, we had an outstanding debt balance of $2.7 billion, equating to gross and net leverage ratios of approximately 2.5x. We continuously evaluate our capital priorities and as always, intend to deploy capital to the areas that we think will generate the greatest returns. Strategic acquisitions remain our top priority for capital allocation.\nAbsent any meaningful M&A, we will evaluate other uses of capital, including debt repayment. Our expectations for the diluted share count will be to exit the year with slightly more than 52 million shares outstanding, which does not assume any stock repurchases at this time.\nIn 2021, free cash flow was $532 million, an increase of 40% from the preceding year and above our prior outlook of approximately $500 million due to the strong operating performance and working capital management. As indicated in January, we expect free cash flow for 2022 to be approximately $450 million. This is a decrease of $80 million from last year due entirely to an anticipated $130 million increase. In capital expenditures, we're expected to total approximately $360 million in 2022.\nWith robust client demand exceeding our expectations in 2021 and expect it to continue, we believe we will require CapEx of approximately 9% of total revenue in 2022 to provide the additional capacity needed to keep patient demand. Legacy businesses are driving most of the year-over-year capital increase, with Safety Assessment responsible for approximately 2/3 of the increase and the remainder in the Manufacturing segment. A summary of our 2022 financial guidance can be found on Slide 40.\nAs a reminder, we will add a 53rd week at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, which is periodically required to true up our fiscal year to a December 31 calendar year-end. The 53rd week has historically been characterized as a partial week of revenue due to the cost in the holidays and a full week of costs.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of 2022, our outlook includes year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 10% on both a reported and organic basis. As Jim mentioned, the DSA revenue growth rate is expected to improve in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. This will be offset by a lower RMS growth rate, reflecting the comparison to an exceptionally strong start in China last year.\nWe are also confident that the revenue growth rate will accelerate during the year, reflecting the robust DSA order book, which extends into 2023 and includes higher pricing as well as the anticipated improvement in the RMS growth rate from the first quarter level. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to increase at a high single-digit rate from $2.53 last year, reflecting a mid-teens tax rate and a year-over-year increase in interest expense.\nIn conclusion, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2021 and believe that we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2022. Our expected 2022 performance reflects our ongoing focus on disciplined investing to support the growth of our businesses, our efforts to drive efficiency, the speed and responsiveness with which we operate and our goal to continually advance our relationship with our clients. We are also confident in our ability to achieve our 2024 financial targets, including approximately 150 basis points of operating margin expansion from the 2021 level. Thank you.\n\nTodd Spencer\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our comments. Operator, we will now take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and welcome to Biotricity's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Deborah Chen. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Biotricity's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, Biotricity's third fiscal 2022 quarter ended on December 31, 2021. So all figures presented for this period will reflect that end date. Yesterday, we issued our fiscal 2022 third quarter results press release, which highlighted a number of financial results A copy of this press release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and the full financials will be filed with the SEC on Form 10-K and posted on EDGAR.\nBefore beginning our formal remarks, I'd like to remind listeners that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to future events. Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Biotricity does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, except as required.\nAt this point, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Biotricity's Founder and CEO, Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq. Please go ahead.\n\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman, Biotricity, Inc.\n\nThank you, Deborah, and thank you, everybody, for joining today. I welcome you to our third quarter fiscal 2022 teleconference.\nWe just completed our first quarter as an asset listed company and achieved many exciting things on our journey towards becoming the all-in-one go-to solution for cardiac diagnostics and disease management. It is always important to note that cardiac disease is the #1 disease killer in every country in the world, owing to its inherent chronic nature, which is to say, cardiac disease rarely resolves on its own or reverses with pharmaceuticals as the cardiovascular system has limited regenerative capacity. Cardiac patients are typically lifelong in duration.\nHowever, diagnosis and regular checkups in cardiologists' offices is expensive, medically inefficient and as we all know now in a COVID environment, inconvenient at best.\nInefficient because an electrocardiogram is a snapshot of a moment in time. Ongoing monitoring is required to assess cardiac health and any changes that occur as patients are typically asymptomatic and issues are intermittent.\nFor moderate to severe cases, remote real-time monitoring is a life-saving tool that can often flag irregularities that justify bringing the patient into a cardiologist off or an ER. We set out to build a complete solution that feels some of the gaps in cardiac care, and we are well on our way to achieve that with the recent and upcoming product releases.\nWhile our technology and its implications for preventing surgeries and saving lives is exciting and now commonly accepted, I sometimes have to step back, take a breath and remind myself, how lucky we are to be alive at a time when technology is truly transforming the state of health care. It fuels my passion for this business to win, disrupt, succeed and transform cardiac care.\nNow let's talk about our third fiscal quarter's progress. Our December quarter was truly pivotal. In late December, we successfully closed a $12 million non-dilutive debt financing on favorable terms. It provides us the capital required to pursue our expansion, commercialization and marketing initiatives and to finance annual recurring revenue subscriptions. $1.6 million of which were hired existing debt on less favorable terms that was coming due.\nWhile all of our hardware and software design in-house, we are well aware, we live in a competitive space. So we plan to move aggressively to solidify and increase our leadership position. Operationally, we achieved solid growth despite the many challenges of Omicron, clinical closures and its impact on productivity.\nSequentially, we increased revenue modestly to $1.9 million. However, I must note we broke our string of 10 quarters of triple-digit year-over-year growth with just a terrific metric. However, on a full fiscal year basis, we believe we can get back to that level of extraordinary growth for this and future fiscal years.\nWe also had several game-changing product introductions as well as the important FDA approval Biotres, which has greatly expanded our total addressable cardiac market and positions us well to make 2022 a pivotal year. Biotres not only expands the company's product portfolio, but opens a new market and increases the total addressable market from $1 billion to $5.7 billion. It is scheduled to be widely available starting in April.\nAs important, we launched Bioheart, a cardiac monitor now directly available to consumers. The device offers the same continuous heart monitoring technology used by physicians. Bioheart allows patients to manage heart conditions with retrospective snapshots and long-term data collection in a true state-of-the-art manner. It opens a new marketplace and revenue stream for Biotricity and expands our total addressable heart monitoring market by another $1.24 billion, giving us a total addressable market of $6.94 billion versus $1 billion from just 2 quarters ago. It can be purchased at www.bioheart.com or on Amazon for $199.\nBioheart's launch is groundbreaking and an important step in reaching our ultimate goal of building a complete cardiac ecosystem, to serve individuals with heart health issues and their cardiologists. I'm proud to note that Bioheart was brought to market in less than a year ahead of schedule and in time for the holiday dropping season.\nI'll now spend a couple of minutes covering our near- and long-term operational strategy. First, I want to note that unlike many other companies, we are insulated from any chip issues related to our growth plans. This is a function of strategic planning when we saw things tightening up.\nNext, currently, we have over 325 centers enrolled in 25 states, up from 323 respectively, we reported last quarter. This growth is slower than I prefer due primarily to COVID headwinds already discussed. While we do not report on details of our sales staffing for competitive reasons, we plan to expand our footprint in our Bioflux diagnostic program as quickly as we can identify top quality people and bring them in.\nStrategically, our ultimate goal is to collapse cardiac services within clinics and hospitals into one ecosystem, the Biotricity ecosystem, so that doctors are using our ecosystem to not deliver just diagnostics, but diagnostics, disease management, remote management and telemedicine all in one place.\nImportantly, we only pursue markets where we are confident reimbursement exists. We've already spent capital to acquire our existing customers. So as we offer new and additional monitoring products and services, the lifetime value of those customers increases at little to no increased marketing spend, which adds an important component to our scalability, upselling, especially as many of these customers' medical needs evolve over the years from diagnostics to disease management and holistic care.\nTechnologically, we are combining AI with data and predictive capabilities to create better and faster analytics and needed delivery for more pervasive and preventative patient monitoring and lifestyle management. Ultimately, we envision Biotricity becoming the largest complex cardiac cloud platform from diagnostics all the way to disease and lifestyle management.\nBefore turning the call over to John to cover the financials, I'll note that in early December, we published a comprehensive shareholder letter, providing our road map for 2022 with milestones, a product road map, growth strategy and goals. It demonstrates our commitment to communicating transparently with our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Ayanoglou.\n\nS. John Ayanoglou\n\nCFO, Biotricity, Inc.\n\nThank you, Waqaas. Financially, as Waqaas mentioned, an important third quarter achievement was a successful $12 million capital raise with nonconvertible debt that also extinguished $1.6 million in less favorable legacy debt.\nOn December 31, our cash position of $16.8 million was its strongest level in company history. We have the strongest balance sheet we've ever had to date. Sales and revenue are always top of mind for management. And internally, we actively target reaching positive cash flow. On the revenue side, we continue to build our professional sales force incrementally and geographically. While Biotricity will always be an R&D company, to an extent we balance R&D investment against resources, value-added and our strategic consideration to extend our technological leadership in the remote cardiac industry.\nThe December quarter highlighted the resiliency of our model and dedication of our employees, despite the highly virulent Omicron and its cascading impact on staffing, clinical research and supply chains. We reported revenue of $1.93 million in fiscal Q3 2022 versus $1 million a year ago for a 93% year-over-year increase. I'm not going to belabor the details of Omicron and its impact. We're all aware that the headwind is real.\nHowever, Biotricity has risen to the occasion, and experts predict Omicron's impact may fade in the weeks ahead. While Omicron's impact may fade, the rates of cardiac disease are not fading. They're not decreasing. So you can imagine the kind of growth we're capable of achieving without these headwinds. We expect a certain pent-up demand as things normalize.\nOne advantage to these headwinds is the big boost that has given physicians and patients to adjust the telemedicine and remote patient monitoring generally. Our gross margin in Q3 was 43%, with our cost of revenue of $1.1 million. So we reported year-over-year revenue up 93%, while our cost of revenue rose just 29% as our business scales.\nSimilarly, we reported G&A of $4.66 million or 40% higher than a year ago. Again, revenue increased 93%, demonstrating our financial discipline and solid operational execution. Further, we reported R&D expense of $900,000. That's a 32% increase year-over-year, again against a 93% increase in revenue.\nThe bottom line was Biotricity incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $7.34 million versus $4.12 million in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Loss per share was $0.149 and $0.111, respectively. However, current quarter net loss included a substantial nonrecurring charge of $1.3 million. Excluding nonrecurring expenses, our net loss would have been $6 million and our adjusted loss per share would have been $0.122 per share for the current quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with the strongest balance sheet in our history, with $16.8 million in cash and a current ratio of over 4:1. We remain on track to show strong full year revenue growth. But the real firepower begins when we have our Biotres and monthly Biocare or subscription lines and they ramp up as they run in parallel to our powerful Bioflux growth.\nAs a result, we are comfortable projecting full fiscal year triple-digit growth rates for the foreseeable future. We're more confident than ever that our technology pipeline will produce major growth over the next few years as we build our cardiac ecosystem to further penetrate and monetize the patient population that we have already touched with our cardiac technologies, a small portion of the cardiac patients that need these services.\nFor our most advanced remote cardiac monitoring solutions, we expect our services will follow those customers throughout their lifetime to monitor and protect them and ensure they're provided with technologically sophisticated superior chronic care. Doing so within a recurring revenue business model is a powerful means to scale the business.\nAt this point, I turn the call back to Waqaas for his closing comments. Thank you.\n\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Chairman, Biotricity, Inc.\n\nI guess I shouldn't complain about our third quarter's 93% year-over-year revenue growth. However, be certain we have our sights set high for the fourth quarter, full year and into 2023 and 2024, especially on a full fiscal year basis.\nOur outlook is primarily driven by our Bioflux product. However, we believe all of our new and upcoming products that complement Bioflux, providing patients and cardiologists more and better custom choices based on their individual needs, will continue to build our revenue, brand value and shareholder value.\nIn a classic case of the hold being worth more than the sum of the parts, while our Bioflux is an important product, our other products round out and support our cardiac ecosystem. Accordingly, I'm more excited about our sales, revenue and growth outlook for the next 12 to 18 months than I was 3 months ago.\nAt this point, I would like to open up the call for questions."

Today's webcast is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nHello. On today's webcast are Stephane de la Faverie, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Akhil Shrivastava, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSince many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impact of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation.\nYou can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com site and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. Throughout our discussion, our profit recovery and growth plan will be referred to as our PRGP.\nDuring the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you with the time scheduled for this webcast.\nAnd now I'll turn the webcast over to Stephane.\n\nStephane de la Faverie\n\nExecutive Group President\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you to discuss our first quarter results and share the great work our teams are delivering across the action plan priorities for Beauty Reimagined. Let me begin with the first quarter.\nWe delivered organic sales growth of 3%, a significant sequential acceleration from the 13% decline in the fourth quarter. We are pleased by the diversity of our performance. As Mainland China contributed nicely to a return to growth, the rest of our markets in total improved sequentially, including high single-digit growth in our priority emerging markets, led by Mexico, Turkey and India's double-digit growth. And Travel Retail grew on a favorable comparable compared to last year low base.\nWe also got off to a strong start to the fiscal year with significant improvement in operating profitability. These results reinforce the confidence we have in our fiscal '26 outlook, a pivotal step towards restoring sustainable sales growth and rebuilding our operating margin to solid double digit in the next few years. The first three action plan priorities of Beauty Reimagined: Accelerate best-in-class consumer coverage, create transformative innovation and boost consumer-facing investment are increasingly amplifying each other to drive accelerating retail sales growth in key markets.\nIn China, we significantly outperformed Prestige Beauty as our retail sales increased double digit ahead of industry, up high single digit. Seven of our brands grew double digit with Le Labo nearly triple digits. We gained share in every category as well as both brick-and-mortar and online. Impressively, we have gained Prestige Beauty share in 5 of the last 6 quarters, which is unparalleled among the biggest Prestige Beauty players.\nIn U.S. Prestige Beauty, our retail sales growth accelerated sequentially. In the quarter, we grew 8% in Skin Care versus the category up 6%. The Ordinary drove our share gain in skin care, while we also gained share in Hair Care led by Aveda. All told, we maintained our Prestige Beauty share calendar year-to-date. The Estée Lauder brand achieved its third consecutive quarter of overall share gain in the U.S., thanks to excellent uptake in innovation. This quarter, it gained share in each of Skin Care, Makeup and Fragrance. Impressively, we delivered strong unit share gain in U.S. Prestige Beauty, demonstrating our strategic actions are driving new consumer acquisition.\nIn several of Western European markets, Prestige Beauty continues to see slow growth, in some cases, negative growth. In France, the biggest category in Prestige Beauty in Western Europe, we gained share in France and Spain. For the U.K., the largest market in the region and where Prestige Beauty is much more resilient, industry sales growth reaccelerated to nearly 10%, and we realized a strong sequential improvement in our retail sales trends. We still have much work to do in the U.K., but we are moving in the right direction.\nOur improving retail sales performance in many key markets around the world is a testament to our team's incredibly strong execution of Beauty Reimagined, starting with accelerating best-in-class coverage. We are advancing with speed to reach consumers where they are, capitalizing on the learnings that we have had with Amazon in the U.S., Canada and Japan. We opened Amazon Storefront in Mexico with Clinique, The Ordinary and Estée Lauder and the U.K. with The Ordinary.\nWe announced our presence on TikTok Shop, launching Clinique, M·A·C and Dr. Jart in the U.S. as well as The Ordinary in Malaysia and Singapore. Impressively m·A·C was awarded TikTok Shop Top brand Campaign Award for 2025 in Personal Care and Life, recognized for the stellar grand opening and tremendous initial success. Our newest TikTok Shop has served to strengthen the performance across channel given how consumers discover, engage and transact. This collective action in our online consumer coverage complemented first quarter growth from our existing presence on fast-growing retailers like Tmall, JD, Douyin and Notino. As a result, global online organic sales growth accelerated to double digit from mid-single digit in the fourth quarter, leading us to believe we outperformed Prestige Beauty in this strategic channel.\nFor our European Travel Retail business, we made great progress in expanding our consumer coverage in Fragrance through new retail activation, new doors and upgrading the existing fleet across our luxury portfolio. This strategic expansion contributed to our double-digit retail sales growth for France across several of our major retailers in the region for the quarter.\nWe also drove similarly strong retail sales growth in the Americas Travel Retail for Fragrance, in part from our all new distribution with Duty Free Americas.\nLooking at innovation, newness from Tom Ford, Killian Paris, Jo Malone London and Aramis kicked off France rich pipeline for fiscal '26. These launches, some of which created allo benefit on existing products, combined with the Le Labo outstanding growth made France our best-performing category, rising 13%. We continue to expect France to be Prestige Beauty's fastest-growing category for fiscal '26, driven by luxury, the largest mix of our France business and where we are the leader as well as over the next few years, driven by both domestic markets and the travel retail channel.\nOn that note, we are thrilled to have opened our new France Atelier in Paris, where our team will blend state-of-the-art technology, data-driven intelligence, leveraging AI and olfactory expertise to craft the next generation of extraordinary scents, all while innovating much quicker than we have in the past.\nSkin Care further drove our organic sales growth in the first quarter. We had an exciting slate of innovation in high-growth subcategory and across Prestige price tiers, including breakthrough launches in eye, acne and longevity targeting all age groups. This introduction, coupled with newness from earlier in the calendar year, contributed to Skin Care's growth. We continue to boost our consumer-facing investment to drive new consumer acquisition, focusing on high ROI opportunities like our brand building, freestanding stores and demand generation media activation.\nWe opened 14 net new freestanding stores for our Fragrance portfolio, including a row of new boutique in New York City Sal District for Frederic Mall, Tom Ford, Jo Malone London and Killian Paris. We introduced stunning new campaign from Tom Ford debut of Black Orchid Reserve to I Only Wear M·A·C and La Mer Gives Skin Life. And we are reengaged in creating new consumer experience across travel retail corridors.\nTo fuel our first three action priorities, we made great strides delivering on the promise of PRGP, which Akhil will describe in more detail. Finally, we are especially encouraged by the momentum we are building as we reimagine the way we work, our fifth action plan priority. Our new executive team is fully in place. Our four newly reorganized regions are fully operational and throughout the organization, we are empowering faster decision-making.\nAs you will recall, we committed in February to increasingly collaborate with partners in areas of business where they can support us to become the best consumer-centric Prestige Beauty company in the world. We are, therefore, thrilled to announce our new partnership with Shopify to modernize and scale our direct-to-consumer business in a phased approach, creating a best-in-class omnichannel consumer experience globally.\nLooking ahead, for the balance of the fiscal year, we continue executing on our action plan priorities, including investing in exciting holiday activation and expanding consumer coverage. As announced yesterday, this includes M·A·C entering U.S. Sephora spanning select stores as well as online and Sephora at course, which allows us to better connect with younger consumer and accelerate M·A·C turnaround in the U.S.\nBefore I close, I want to share a few accomplishments from our just published fiscal 2025 social impact and sustainability report. Since we announced our first set of public goals in 2019, we are proud to have achieved several of them across climate, water, waste, sourcing, ingredient transparency and impactful social investment. In introducing additional 2030 goals, we are reemphasizing our focus on women and girl advancement guided in spirit by our founder with a new commitment to contribute $50 million to support health, education, leadership and entrepreneurship.\nIn closing, the first quarter marked the beginning of our return to growth as anticipated for our fiscal 2026 outlook. While the macroeconomic environment globally continues to be dynamic with a variety of headwinds and tailwinds, we remain vigilant and focused on achieving our ambition for Beauty Reimagined. I am incredibly grateful to our employees around the world who delivered a strong start to fiscal '26 onward and upward.\nI will now turn the call over to Akhil.\n\nAkhil Shrivastava\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stephane. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall, we are encouraged with our return to growth and the improvement in margins and cash flow results, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams globally. We are determined to continue driving value creation and executing with excellence and urgency across the pillars of Beauty Reimagined.\nBefore I share an update on our reaffirmed full year outlook, I'll start with a quick recap of our first quarter results. For more detail on our first quarter performance, please refer to our press release issued this morning.\nStarting with organic net sales. We grew 3% compared to last year. This was driven by double-digit growth in Fragrance and low single-digit growth in Skin Care. Together, these led to high single-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and Mainland China. Sales from our Makeup and Hair Care categories declined, partially driving the low single-digit decrease in the Americas.\nTurning now to margins. Our gross margin expanded 60 basis points and was 73.3% in the quarter. This was driven by sales growth as well as strong net benefits from our PRGP, reflecting operational efficiencies, lower promotional activity and ongoing reductions in excess and obsolescence. These results more than offset the headwinds from inflation and foreign exchange transactions.\nIn terms of operating margin, we expanded 300 basis points to 7.3% compared to 4.3% last year. This expansion reflects net benefits from our PRGP. Specifically, they drove a 3% reduction in nonconsumer-facing expenses, even with the normalization of employee incentive costs. As a result, we were able to fund consumer-facing investments, which increased by 4%. We are delivering on our strategic priority to improve operating margin for the full year as we strengthen overall cost efficiency and leverage under our PRGP.\nWe are continuing to fuel consumer-facing investments that build brand desirability while maintaining discipline on nonconsumer-facing expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 40.5%, up from 38.8% last year. The quarterly rate is based on our estimated full year geographical mix of earnings and is expected to improve in the second half of the year as profitability builds throughout the year. In addition, the elevated rate includes the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. We are evaluating tax planning opportunities aligned with the strategic changes we have been making to our organizational structure and mix of business.\nOur return to sales growth, combined with strong cost efficiency and leverage, more than doubled diluted EPS to $0.32, up from $0.14 last year. In terms of our overall PRGP, building upon the work we did last year, we are continuing to execute with rigor, discipline and clear purpose to optimize key elements across our cost structure. We are driving momentum across the P&L, focusing on operational excellence to improve gross margin, streamlining our organization to enhance agility, effectiveness and efficiency through ongoing restructuring and leveraging our competitive approach to procurement to reduce costs and maximize ROI across all areas of spend.\nThese efforts continue to advance our PRGP initiatives, creating fuel for growth, improving profitability and positioning the company for sustainable long-term value creation.\nProceeding now to the restructuring component of our PRGP. Through September 30, we recorded $697 million of total cumulative charges, primarily in employee-related costs.\nTurning now to cash flows. For the 3 months, we used $340 million in net cash flows from operating activities, a significant improvement as compared to the $670 million use of cash last year. The improvement primarily reflects higher earnings as well as a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities despite an increase in restructuring payments. We invested $96 million in CapEx, prioritizing consumer-facing investments to fuel growth while optimizing all other CapEx investments. For the quarter, CapEx was down 32% versus the prior year, reflecting the phasing of projects. With a full year outlook to invest roughly 4% of projected sales and CapEx, we are maintaining a more efficient and normalized level of investment to drive long-term sustainable growth. Also in the quarter, we paid $150 million in deferred consideration associated with the fiscal 2023 acquisition of the Tom Ford brand.\nTurning now to outlook. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 full year outlook. While we don't expect a linear path given macro volatility and prior year comparisons, our first quarter results give us confidence as we remain focused on delivering our full year outlook. In terms of organic net sales, we still expect flat to 3% growth for the full year. We anticipate stronger performance in the first half with favorable comparisons in Asia Pacific, driven by our Global Travel Retail business as well as in Mainland China.\nWe are seeing improvement in consumer sentiment in Mainland China, though it remains subdued and has yet to fully recover from historical lows. In our Global Travel Retail business, we have good momentum in the West, fueled by consumer-facing investments and distribution expansion. That said, persistent challenges in the East continue to pressure retail sales. We expect these challenges to have a greater impact in the second half, particularly as we face tougher comparisons to last year when Mainland China returned to growth and our Global Travel Retail business started shipping in line with retail. Despite this anticipated variability, we are encouraged by the start of the fiscal year and by our return to growth.\nBefore I close, let me reaffirm our assumptions regarding evolving trade policies and enacted tariffs. Based on information available and net of our planned mitigation actions through October 24, we continue to expect tariff-related headwinds to impact profitability by approximately $100 million. This does not include any subsequent or future changes. We continue to evaluate additional strategies to further mitigate these impacts, including more PRGP initiatives and potential pricing actions.\nIn closing, our focus remains on being the most consumer-centric beauty company and creating long-term value through sustainable growth, margin improvement and cash productivity. To our teams around the world, thank you. Your dedication to executing across all pillars of Beauty Reimagined is reflected in our results and is driving a return to sustainable sales growth and rebuilding our operating margin to solid double digit over the next few years.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

Today's webcast is being recorded.\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\n\nLaraine A.

During the Q&A session that we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this webcast.\nAnd now, I'll turn the webcast over to Stéphane.\n\nStephane de la Faverie\n\nExecutive Group President\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. Before we discuss our results for fiscal '25 and '26 ambition, let me begin with a moment of remembrance of our [ Bill ] of Chairman Emeritus, Leonard Lauder, who passed in June. On behalf of myself, Akhil, the executive team, Board of Directors and the Lauder family, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for the sympathy share. We were profoundly moved by the outpouring of combustion for employees, consumers, peers, retailers, suppliers, media, analysts and investors. Your condolences celebrated a life beautifully lift and a legacy deeply felt, recognizing our Leonard uniquely shaped and revolutionize not just our company, but also the Beauty industry.\nLeonard was a mentor to me and as he was to so many others. I was a strong advocate for Beauty Reimagined when he entrusted us to lead. We are more committed than ever to regaining prestige beauty leadership in his honor and upholding the company's Vice Champion.\nTurning to our fiscal '25 full year performance. Our results were in line with the revised outlook we provided in May, and the expectation Akhil and I set in our first earnings call in February. Nearly 2/3 of our 8% organic sales decline came from travel retail as it decreased 28% driven by strategic decision and prolonged week conversion. Importantly, we ended fiscal '25 much better position than fiscal '24 with healthier trade inventory, especially in Travel Retail Asia for currently forecasted demand.\nTravel retail represented approximately [ 15% ] of reported sales, down 4 percentage points from fiscal '24 and 14% age points below its fiscal '21 peak reached during the pandemic, making it more similar to the China Global prestige beauty share and reducing our exposure to its volatility. Gross margin expanded 230 basis points to 74%, driven by PRGP benefits and better by 50 basis points than the outlook given in May, despite significant volume deleverage. Operating margin of 8% on the 220 basis points, driven by sales declines and increased consumer-facing investments. Diluted EPS decreased 40%.\nSince I became CEO, we have acted with urgency to operationalize our strategic vision of Beauty Reimagined, making strong initial progress across all 5 action plan priorities from January through June. In the second half of fiscal '25, we gained prestige beauty share in China, Japan and the U.S. demonstrated not only our ability to return quickly to share gain by building on our brand's high desirability but also early wins for new consumer coverage and uptake of enticing innovation. Globally, Le Labo and La Mer gained prestige beauty share in the second half, confirming their strong desirability and the ordinary accelerated to high single-digit retail sales growth in the fourth quarter.\nLa Mer, TOM FORD and Estée Lauder fueled our second half share gain in China while Le Labo, Estée Lauder and La Mer Power Japan. In the U.S., the [indiscernible] Clinique and Estée Lauder drove share gain while Estée Lauder new double were considered ranked #1 product launch in prestige makeup by [indiscernible] for January through June. In our first action plan priority, accelerate best-in-class consumer coverage, we achieved many accomplishments in the second half of fiscal '25, particularly for our online business. Following The Ordinary's launch in the U.S. Amazon premium beauty store in the third quarter, Origin and Aveda launched in the fourth quarter while Estée Lauder and Aveda opened in the Amazon Prime Beauty store in Canada. We now have even brand store front in the U.S. and 3 in Canada.\nAnd in Southeast Asia, we built scales on Shopee and TikTok Shop across the third and fourth quarters. This action complemented second half growth from our existing presence in fast-growing online retailers like Tmall and Douyin. As a result, online organic sales growth accelerated from low single digit in the first half to single digit in the second half. Online reached 31% of reported sales for fiscal '25, up 3 percentage points from fiscal '24 to an all-time record, and we expect online mix to climb higher still. We continued our expansion in pharmacy in Europe and began entering the pharma channel in Latin America with Clinique responding to rising demand for their brands.\nMoving to our second action priorities, create transformative innovation and innovate across prestige price tiers to reach a wider audience. Throughout the second half of fiscal '25, we introduced a robust slate of breakthrough on-trend and commercial innovation aimed at new consumer acquisition, as you can see on the slide. We are realigning innovation portfolio to deliver gross margin accretive product clearer and better capture faster growing industry trend in skin care with a night, longevity under as well as in makeup and the still in demand Luxury Brands segment as well as Hair Care.\nLet me share a few highlights from the fourth quarter, beginning with skin care. La Mer [indiscernible] the iconic success of its treatment lotion with the balancing treatment lotion, which, along with the brand's third quarter launch of night Recovery Concentrate for La Mer second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic sales growth in Mainland China. Clinique and The Ordinary showcase their unique derm and scientific brand equities at entry prestige pricing. For Clinique, the brand launched a supercharged SPF version of [indiscernible] our dermatologists recommended DDML. For the ordinary its new UV filter SPF-45 serum offered consumers suncare protection in its signature serum format.\nIn makeup, Clinique build upon its blockbuster Almost Lipstick franchise with a third shade, Nude Honey. Since 2021, Clinique has driven strong sales growth of Almost Lipstick, with volumes over 30x greater than 4 years ago, demonstrating our ability to leverage social media virality to further fuel demand and attract younger consumers. MAC's bond famous commercial innovation, paired with the new Lipglass Air contributed to strong share gain in the U.S. prestige makeup lip color and lip-gloss subcategory in the second half. Aveda introduced Miraculous Oil, which is significantly outperforming initial sales expectation.\nFor our third action plan priority, boost consumer-facing investment to accelerate new consumer acquisition. We increased consumer-facing investment at a greater rate of growth in the second half versus the first half to reignite retail growth. In Mainland China, this contributed to high single-digit retail sales growth and share gain in each of the third and fourth quarters, solidifying share gains for the fiscal year with every category improving share. In the fourth quarter, 10 brands grew at retail to fuel share gains in every category and every channel. The incremental investment coupled with innovation drove outstanding performance for 618 for La Mer, Lauder and Jo Malone London across online platform and powered the ordinary success launched in China with Sephora.\nAnd we invested in our freestanding store as we strategically drive a more productive fleet. For the full year, we opened nearly 40 doors for our France brand to much success and close unproductive doors primarily for MAC, Aveda and Origin for over 10 net new stores globally. Le Labo continued its spectacular expansion with new stores, including the Beijing and seal Experience Center, while Jo Malone London had an in-store navigation and experience to meet evolving consumer needs.\nNext, let me share an update on our portfolio review. We recently engaged external adviser as we consider evolving the [indiscernible] to best align with the strategic vision of Beauty Reimagined and focus on our highest return opportunities over the medium to long term. We will share a bit in due course.\nLet me now turn to our fiscal '26 outlook. With 3 fiscal years of sales decline and operating margin erosion behind us, we enter fiscal '26 with signs of momentum and the start of our turnaround, a return to top line growth in fiscal '26 and the pursuit of a solid double-digit operating margin in the years ahead. For fiscal '26, we expect to deliver low single-digit organic sales growth maintain our now strong gross margin despite the headwind of incremental tariffs and expand our operating margin by 165 basis points at the midpoint. Akhil will describe the drivers are in detail, but let me share a few overarching themes.\nFor sales, we intend to significantly reduce these costs. We made good progress in this -- in fiscal '25 and believe there is much more that we can achieve. Our sales growth also unbased benefit from accelerating best-in-class consumer coverage, recognizing we still have a lot of work to do in markets with a high penetration of department stores. Finally, we are putting greater emphasis on accelerating in high-growth energy markets, given our still untapped potential as emerging markets only represent 10% of reported sales. For operating margin, the organization has embraced PRGP and its momentum is very encouraging. We achieved much more PRGP than we expected in fiscal '25 which gives us confidence that we can deliver meaningful cost savings in fiscal '26 and fund incremental consumer-facing investments.\nTo fuel our '26 outlook, we are focused on executing with excellence Beauty Reimagined. Already in the first quarter, we are further accelerating best-in-class consumer coverage. The Ordinary launch on Tmall in China with a breakthrough service, the first AI-powered flagship stores co-develop with Tmall. And we are exciting to be expanding on Amazon Premium Beauty store success beyond the U.S. and Canada, starting with The Ordinary in Amazon U.K., which launched in July as well as Clinique in Amazon Mexico this month. In travel retail, we are greatly expanding our presence in the Americas through the all new distribution with Duty Free Americas. This builds on progress in EMEA to expand the presence of our luxury fragrance brand in airports.\nMoving to our second action plan priority, create transformative innovation. We have identified our external hire for the new leader of R&D and expect to make this announcement in the coming weeks. For fiscal '26, we are targeting innovation to be back representing over 25% of sales. With this pipeline, we are well on our way towards tripling the percentage of innovation launched in less than a year from 10% to 30%. In fiscal '26, we are set to have 16% of our innovation that is launched within the year. Here are a few fiscal '26 innovation already in the hands of consumers.\nIn skin care, reflecting our imperative to innovate from the entry pricing through luxury tiers, The Ordinary launch of for 10% powder to cream concentrate, a break-through formula. Further up the prestige tier is still on the advanced and repair franchise introduced a new high cream, while Re-Nutriv launched a watery lotion powered by longevity science. In makeup, we are rebuilding on our gain in lip with MAC Lipglazer Glossy Liner and Bobbi Brown's Cashmere Luxe Matte Lipstick. And following TOM FORD's recent success with Cushion Foundation, the brand launched architecture Radiant hydrating Foundation. In France, the category poised to lead prestige beauty industry globally in fiscal '26. Jo Malone London's Raspberry Ripple, this year's seasonal limited edition color is outperforming last year's limited edition runaway success.\nTOM FORD extended their halo of its Oud collection with Oud Voyager and expanded to its popular Black Orchid franchise with Black Orchid reserve. We are also proud to mark the exciting relaunch of the [indiscernible] brand within [ Trition ] and new funds fronted by global ambassador NBA Hall of Famer, Dwyane Wade. For our third action plan priority, boost consumer face investment, we are deploying a new media model that puts greater focus on demand generation through broader media analytics. We made significant shift in the mix of media budget to enhance consumer acquisition and improve ROI accountability. Our investment in AI have begun to show meaningful impact transforming how we engage with consumers and operate internally. From personalized marketing, media optimization to agile go-to-market execution AI has driven a 31% increase in ROI from our North American media campaigns, enabling faster decision-making and stronger real-time market responsiveness.\nFor our fourth action plan priority, fuel sustainable growth through bold efficiencies. Among our newer initiatives, when we expanded the PRGP in February '25 is outsourcing. Our analysis revealed a significant gap versus industry benchmark, and we are rapidly advancing these initiatives. For our final action plan priority, reimagine the way we work. As of June 1, brands own global strategy, innovation and long-range planning, while region have full responsibility for the P&L, allowing for greater local agility and consumer focus. We introduced a new ways of working playbook aligned to the structure to drive brand region collaboration, and we are very encouraged by the elevated engagement so far.\nIn closing, we are energized as we are transforming our company through Beauty Reimagined. To our employees, thank you for bringing Beauty Reimagined to life in 6 short months through your tremendous passion and commitment. Together with all of you, I am excited for what we will accomplish.\nI will now turn the call over to Akhil.\n\nAkhil Shrivastava\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stéphane. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before discussing outlook, I'll briefly recap our fourth quarter results and highlight progress in key areas of the business. For more information on a full year and fourth quarter performance, please refer to a press release issued this morning. Overall, we delivered fourth quarter and second half results at the top end of our implied guidance range.\nStarting with top line. Organic net sales declined 13% in the fourth quarter, reflecting declines across all product categories, except fragrance as well as across every geographic region, primarily driven by global travel retail as we expected. And encouragingly, we are seeing positive results with share gains in some key markets, notably in Mainland China and Japan. In the U.S., we made significant progress in narrowing our share losses during the fiscal year and gained share in the second half.\nNow looking at margins. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was relatively flat even as we faced the steepest sales volume decline of the year. For the full year, we delivered 230 basis points of gross margin expansion despite our sales deleverage, landing at 74%. This meaningful expansion was driven by the relentless execution of our PRGP.\nTurning to operating margin for the fourth quarter. We delivered 4% compared to 9% last year. This was driven by a 580 basis points increase in consumer-facing investments as a percentage of sales. On the full year, consumer-facing investments increased 400 basis points as we invested in our brands as part of Beauty Reimagined to fuel growth and long-term value creation. These investments were enabled through our PRGP, which fueled our continued progress in reducing nonconsumer-facing costs in the fourth quarter, ending the year with a 6 percentage reduction. In the fourth quarter, we also recorded $425 million of impairment charges relating to Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced. This reflects challenges in Mainland China and Korea for Dr.Jart+ and continued underperformance in geographies and channels from Too Faced.\nOur effective tax rate for the full year was 38.8% compared to 31% last year. This reflects a higher effective tax rate on our fund operations due to our geographical mix of earnings and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Our diluted EPS was $0.09 in the fourth quarter as compared to $0.64 last year. Looking now at the PRGP restructuring program. As of June 30, we recorded $610 million of total cumulative charges, primarily in employee-related costs.\nMoving to our cash generation. For the year, we generated $1.3 billion in net cash flow from operating activities compared to $2.4 billion last year. This decrease is primarily due to lower earnings adjusted for noncash items and an unfavorable change in operating assets and liability. This also reflects that last year, we made a very significant year-on-year reduction in our inventory, which drove very strong CFFO in the base period. Additionally, the reduction liked a significant increase in restructuring payments. We invested $602 million in capital expenditure, down 34% compared to last year, which reflected prior year payments relating to the manufacturing facility in Japan. This level of CapEx reflects a strong focus on optimizing capital expenditures and prioritizing consumer-facing investments.\nFree cash flow generation remains a strategic priority, and we are focused on driving improvements in working capital, CapEx and operational efficiency to strengthen free cash flow going forward.\nNow turning to outlook. Our priority is to execute our Beauty Reimagined action plans with excellence. The strategy is designed to drive long-term valuation and restore growth, improve margins and drive cash. We are focused on driving sustainable sales growth in fiscal '26 and beyond as well as achieving a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years. Beginning with fiscal '26, we are providing only an annual outlook. This approach gives us more agility and flexibility to navigate ongoing volatility while better aligning with a long-term value creation and strategic priorities.\nAlso, as you may have seen in our press release issued this morning and consistent with prior years, we continue to develop our strategy and allocate resources by product category. Beginning with the first quarter, we will be reporting our fiscal '26 and comparable fiscal '25, results by reorganized geographic regions that align with our recent leadership changes. We plan to share more detailed financial information based on our new regional structures in the coming weeks.\nNow let me update you on our assumptions regarding evolving trade policies and enacted tariffs. As I mentioned in May, our task force has been moving with urgency, closely monitoring developments and evaluating various scenarios to mitigate some of the tariff impacts. Since then, our teams have acted swiftly to implement mitigation actions, including leveraging available trade programs and further optimizing our regional manufacturing footprint to bring production closer to the consumer, including through a facility in Japan. These efforts, along with the agility we have built into our supply chain are helping to offset more than half of the expected impact and better position us to adapt quickly to address the evolving trade policies.\nBased on what we know today and end of our planned mitigation strategies, we expect tariff-related headwinds to impact profitability by approximately $100 million. We continue to evaluate additional strategies to further mitigate these impacts, including more PRGP initiatives and potential pricing actions.\nTurning now to our industry expectations. For fiscal '26, we assume modest global prestige beauty growth in the range of 2% to 3%, which is an improvement versus fiscal '25. While there are early signs of stabilization in Mainland China, travel retail conversion continues to be weak, and challenges persist in the West, including subdued consumer sentiment in the U.S. and Western Europe. In terms of retail sales, our expectations assume retail sales growth in line with or ahead of prestige beauty in key markets. We also remain focused on improving our performance and narrowing the gap between retail and net sales growth globally. In fiscal '26, we aim to achieve this through tighter monitoring of inventory in trade and a significant reduction in discounts.\nThat said, progress may take longer in some markets and is unlikely to be linear. Particularly in North America, we ended fiscal '25 with an approximate 5 percentage points gap between retail and net sales growth for the full year. While we expect the gap to narrow throughout the year, a greater disconnect is anticipated in the first quarter.\nMoving to top line. For the full year, we expect organic net sales to be flat to up 3%. Our outlook assumes mid-single-digit net growth in Mainland China as well as meaningful improvement in our global travel retail business. It also assumes more broad-based improvements across the rest of the business compared to last year. Let me now share a few details. We expect full year organic net sales in a global travel retail business to return to growth at the midpoint of our outlook. This reflects the improvement in shipment compared to last year in Asia Travel Retail, particularly in the first half as we anniversary the impact of actions taken to improve retailer inventory levels, along with the strategic decision to reduce our exposure to reseller activity.\nHowever, this improvement is expected to be offset to some extent by persistent challenges in the broader retail environment, including weak conversion. As a result, we expect a wider range of net growth in global travel retail in the second half, reflecting ongoing uncertainty. In the rest of the business, we expect to deliver low single-digit organic net sales growth for the full year, reflecting improvement in year-on-year growth rates across most markets relative to fiscal '25. In terms of the first quarter, we expect organic net sales to be down low single digits to slightly positive. This reflects high single-digit growth in our global travel retail business, while maintaining a strategic initiative to keep the mix of business in line with industry norms. In addition, we anticipate a return to solid growth in Mainland China and a more moderate decline in the remainder of the business.\nTurning now to our PRGP. In fiscal '26, we are continuing to execute with rigor discipline and clear purpose to optimize key elements across our cost structure to improve margins and profitability as well as create fuel for growth. We are pleased with the meaningful progress we have made in fiscal '25 and remain focused on advancing our PRGP initiatives in fiscal '26. Through our PRGP, we expect continued benefits in fiscal '26 to gross margin and to operating expenses, specifically nonconsumer-facing expenses as we enhance overall productivity and rightsize our cost base.\nNow looking at our restructuring program. We remain on track and continue to advance key initiatives inclusive of approvals through August and relative high end of the total expected ranges we previously communicated. We have approved initiatives accounting for over 60% of expected gross benefits and nearly 50% of both anticipated charges and net reduction in positions. With that backdrop, let me walk you through our other full year assumptions. We assume an operating margin between 9.4% and 9.9%, reflecting greater expansion in the second half of the year as we expect benefits from our PRGP to sequentially each quarter. In fiscal '26, we expect margin progression despite year-on-year headwinds from incremental tariffs and normalized bonus levels.\nOur estimated geographical mix of earnings is expected to drive an effective tax rate of approximately 36%. This assumes a higher rate of approximately 40% in the first quarter with improvement over the course of the year as we expect to build profitability. In addition, we are monitoring certain provisions in global tax legislations that may expire in fiscal '26, which if not extended, could increase our effective tax rate. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $1.90 and $2.10, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 365 million shares. This reflects year-on-year growth of 26% to 39%.\nTurning now to cash generation. In fiscal year '26, we expect to generate net cash flows from operating activities between $1 billion to $1.1 billion. While this reflects a slight decline from last year driven by the anticipated peak in restructuring payments, we are confident in our ability to mitigate some of the pressures through a strong focus on managing working capital. We expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately 4% of sales, reflecting a more efficient and normalized level of expenditures along with our focus and determination to optimize CapEx overall and target the investments in consumer-facing areas to fuel growth.\nIn closing, we remain confident in Beauty Reimagined, grounded by a consumer-centric mindset that prioritizes growth driving investments, cost discipline and operational efficiency. While we are not providing an outlook beyond fiscal '26, we are determined to down cost leverage through sales growth in fiscal '27 and bring to bear with urgency PRGP benefits from optimizing of our end-to-end operating model to drive cost savings, including through ongoing outsourcing initiatives, tax planning consistent with the strategic changes we are making in our mix of business and a more competitive approach to procurement.\nTo our employees, thank you for your dedication and excellence through this period of meaningful transformation. Your resilience and commitment drive our progress. Together, we are turning strategy into execution and execution into long-term value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

The conference will begin shortly.\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. The Electrica teleconference is starting now. Thank you.\n\nRaluca Kasap\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Electrica\n\nHi everyone. I'm Raluca, Head of Investor Relations. I'm here with the entire Electrica Management Team. Thank you for joining us. It's a conference call and a live webcast. We are going to present and discuss the nine months' 2025 financial results.

We'll make the recording of the presentation available latest tomorrow, and the transcript as soon as possible. Now we'll begin the presentation of the financial results, followed by a question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn over the conference to Mr. Alexandru Chiri??, Electrica CEO. Thank you.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nThank you, Raluca. Dear ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us at this teleconference in 2025. In a nutshell, the financial and operational performance recorded in these first nine months of the year supports the direction we set for the companies within the Electrica Group: solid, financially disciplined, and ready for major investments. The achievement of a net profit of almost RON 840 million and the EBITDA exceeding RON 1.7 billion validate the efficiency of our strategic decision towards an integrated business model.\nThis robust performance is a direct result of our efficiency measures, rigorous processes, and, of course, consistent execution across all business lines. The Supply segment has returned to a stable position and contributed significantly to the strengthening of our financial results. As the market liberalized since the 1 July 2025, both the EBITDA and the net result of the segment had a positive evolution and impacted significantly the result. While the Distribution segment continues to provide a steady flow of value through investments carried out at a sustained pace, in this quarter, we recorded a threshold of 4 million customers connected to our network.\nThe investments are commissioned according to plan, with the aim to enhance the quality and resilience of the infrastructure across the counties we serve. In the face of an increasingly competitive and dynamic energy market, our strategy centers on maximizing core business growth while maintaining a superior level of performance throughout the group's operation. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders who approved last week to initiate the necessary procedures to obtain financing intent for the acquisition of four business lines within an aggregated limit of up to EUR 1 billion for the period 2025-2027.\nThanks to our robust financial position, we constantly evaluate the opportunities that come up within the energy market, the ones in line with our core business. As we always do, we'll promptly and transparently update investors as this initiative takes shape. Renewable energy projects are a central focus for our team. We have accelerated the development of our renewable and storage portfolio, with the objective of supporting Romania's economic development, strengthening long-term energy security, and aiding energy transition.\nAs a summary of Electrica renewables production, you know that Vulturu and Satu Mare 2 PV parks have been operational since the beginning of July 2025, respectively October. Therefore, at this time, we have approximately 4 MWp install capacity operational. For other two photovoltaic parks, Satu Mare 3 and Bihor 1, with a total capacity of 140 MW, the estimated completion date is second semester of next year. On the battery energy storage system, we are currently working on four projects presented before, totaling 169 MWh, as well as on the additional 15 storage projects we announced last month, totaling 1 GWh capacity.\nThis perfectly aligns with our strategy that is approved, aligned, and looking forward to 2030 to get it done. Looking ahead, we hold a positive outlook for 2025 and are committed to exceeding expectations with regards to our results and investment objectives. Investments in network infrastructure, digitalization, renewables production, and improvement of our internal processes remain our highest priorities.\nWe firmly believe our strategy, our operational discipline, our long-term vision, and, most importantly, the professionalism of my colleagues in the whole group will enable us to deliver sustainable value to all stakeholders and contribute to building a secure, a green energy future for Romania. I will pass the presentation to our CFO, ?tefan. We'll provide detailed insights into our financial performance. As custom at the end of the presentation, we invite you to actively participate and address any questions you may have. We would like to have your insights and perspectives, as we highly value them. Thank you.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nThank you, Alexandru. Now moving on to the numbers, I suggest we go to the first slide, slide number 13, which is a snapshot of our summary consolidated financials. Here you can see the increase of the revenues nine months 2025 compared with a similar period of 2024, which is due to also an increase in price of the energy, but also due to some increase in quantities of energy supplied by our distribution, distributed by our distribution. In terms of EBITDA, as Alexandru was also mentioning, we reached a significant milestone of RON 1.7 billion as EBITDA for nine months 2025.\nYou can see here the comparison that this is basically what we are getting for a full year in 2023, and we are quite, quite pleased and proud of this result, which, as you will see, is the contribution of both our DSO subsidiary, but also of our supply subsidiary, which after the exit of the support scheme came back to levels of EBITDA, which are positive and are contributing significantly to the result of the group.\nIn terms of net result, you can see the jump, which is, let's say, in line with the jump in the EBITDA, considering also the evolution of the deferred tax items. We are reaching again a level of profitability, which is exceeding 10% as a net result margin. As net debt, you can see the decrease of the position of net debt compared with the end of last year, which is related to the fact that we exited from the support scheme. We are collecting from the support scheme. We have collected some RON 944 million this year from the support scheme, and the amounts are not increasing anymore after the end of June because the support scheme for power has come to an end.\nYou'll see this evolution of the net debt position also for our main subsidiaries in Supply and Distribution. Moving to the next slide, to slide 14, you can see here the waterfall, which is showing the evolution and explaining the difference of EBITDA compared with the similar period of last year. We have here a positive variation of the energy margin of RON 750 million, which is comprised of positive results both in the Distribution segment and the Supply segment.\nIn the Distribution segment, we have roughly RON 300 million as a positive contribution, which is coming from an increase in the tariffs of distribution with approximately 0.5%, and then a decrease in the distributed energy of approximately 2.1%. This is getting a significant positive impact of RON 430 million, which is more than compensating the effect of the increase of the expenses to energy for network losses. CPT on technological consumption. This is an increase because, as you might remember, last year, for part of last year, we were also having a matching mechanism, which was providing by centralized way energy at the RON 450 for the distribution companies.\nWe have also a significant plus in the energy market in the supply segment of RON 442 million, which is comprised of several effects. There is an effect of increasing the sale price of the energy. There is the effect that we do not have the cap anymore on the recognition of the cost with the imbalances starting 1 July 2025. Also, for Q2 from 1 April 2025, we had under the support scheme the increase in the percentage of recognition of imbalances from 5% to 10%. The fact that since we are not in the support scheme anymore, we do not have anymore the method cost plus, so we do not have the cap anymore on the price of the energy in comparison with the acquisition cost of the energy.\nAll these components are generating positive impact for the variation of revenues and variation of subsidies, which are more than compensating the increase in the cost of electricity. This results in a roughly RON 500 million positive energy margin contribution for the supply. We have also RON 22 million from other revenues, which is an increase of RON 12 million from the headquarter due to the positive resolution of some litigations, and also an increase on some other revenues in the distribution of RON 16 million.\nOn the OPEX part, we have a negative variation of RON 100 million, which is a net impact generated mostly by the expenses with salaries and other employee benefits from the Distribution segment, which is continuing the process of aligning the benefits with our regions and our regions in the distribution area.\nWe have a negative impact from repairs and maintenance of RON 21 million, mainly for the Distribution segment, and also a negative impact of RON 28 million from the meter readers and increase of taxes related to special construction tax. Nevertheless, as you'll see later on, the distribution is performing very strongly and provides a significant contribution to our result. In terms of net result variation, nine months 2025 versus nine months 2024, RON 537 million positive contribution, which is coming mainly for the EBITDA, and as I was mentioning, this is affected by the tax deferral element in case of the income tax expense by RON 90 million.\nThere is an impact on the financial result, which is mainly coming from the currency differences for the debt, which is in foreign currency and for which we will be considering to implement hedging solutions in the future.\nIn the Distribution segment, you see here the highlights. I think one of the most important elements that I'm proud of, and I would like to mention, is that we have the fact that we exceeded 4 million users in our distribution area. By the fact that the networks are growing, people are connecting to the network, we have exceeded this milestone. In terms of results, you see here the explanation about the energy margin. I covered them in the slides before.\nI would also mention that in terms of net result, we have here also a significant impact in net result, increased by roughly RON 200 million, mainly from the contribution of EBITDA, with an impact from the income tax expense and financial result.\nNet debt decreased also with RON 81 million compared with the year end 2024, with an increase in, with the increase of bank borrowings offset by increase of cash and cash equivalent, and a decrease in overdraft showing also our preoccupation and our concern to move the debt for a longer tenor from short-term tenor from overdraft to long-term loans. You have here also the waterfall related to the EBITDA evolution compared with the previous month, and you can see here the significant contribution of the energy revenues, energy margin.\nHere are the details about the Distribution segment and revenues that we done as a result of net debt. You see the evolution also of net debt. Next slide is the usual slide, slide 17, the analysis on the budget, how this is composed starting from the RRAB applied on the regulated asset base.\nIn the next slide, you have the decomposition of the nine months results based on the same elements so that you better understand the economics and the methodology of the distribution tariffs and distribution methodology. Slide 19, you have the results there in terms of operational results, also in terms of results of evolution of net losses and distributed volumes, also the achievement of the CapEx plan as compared with planned M&A CapEx plan. I'll go then to slide 21 with a summary of the Electrica Furnizare. Here you have also the details about the energy margin.\nI would stay a little bit on the fact that we have also here the reduction of the net debt, which is shown due to the fact that we start to reduce the loans which were taken for the support scheme once the support scheme ended, and we are starting to collect the amount. Also, another element to be mentioned is that we are already the fourth quarter in a row for positive EBITDA for the Supply business, and in fact, the growth of the Supply business, of the EBITDA of the Supply business compared with the similar period for last year, is in majority provided by the growth of EBITDA in the supply.\nYou have the data about ranking in the market of Electrica Furnizare, volumes of revenues, volumes of energy supplied on the various categories of markets. I will stay a little bit on slide 25 where you see the evolution of the price evolution on the day-ahead market and balancing market, and you can see that after the beginning of the year, right now we are in the situation in which both markets are showing prices which are at a more lesser level than the ones in the previous year.\nSlide 26 is showing the situation of the receivables, basically adjusting the receivables with the turnover. We are in a similar situation like in the past. We have increased revenues due to the increase of the energy prices, and this is proportionally reflected also in the receivables. Otherwise, there is not an issue about collecting of receivables. We are also having initiatives related to automating the initiation of legal recovery procedures and also outsourcing the out-of-court amicable collections process for receivables over 90 days for the past due. We do not have a problem related to collection.\nIn terms of IFRS 9, the debt allowances are mostly related to some historical cases, some older than five years. As previously mentioned, during the entire period with the support scheme and after, there is not an issue about collecting from the customers. Electrica Serv on slide 21, it is going through a process of optimization and transformation in the fact that, in front of the competition, increased competition in the market for green energy solutions, we would like to position it as well as possible to act in this market and to be able to compete in this market with the measures that we are considering.\nWe are looking for a result improving towards the end of the year. In terms of Production segment, we had a question on the Production segment. This starts to contribute stronger and stronger to the results. This is posted also here in the slide, and also as a separate segment in the notes about segment in the financials. We have Vulturu, which is producing since the first part of the year, and we are having Satu Mare, which got into the trial period recently. This shows the revenue starting to increase, and basically, we have roughly 550 MW of production at the end of the year.\nEven if it's not necessarily a very big number, it shows that in terms of the projects that we are doing, we are working at the top, we are putting them into production, and we are consistent with executing our strategy. In terms of group liquidity, we have the best position so far after the beginning of the monitoring of this situation and after the support scheme came. It is also related to the fact that we improved our efforts in collecting. We have also the liquidity from the bond issued in the summer that is placed in T-bills and deposits along the way until this is to be spent in the project of generation.\nWe have also a very good position of liquidity in our supply subsidiary, which collected the amount of tariffs from the other supply companies. In terms of debt profile, slide 30, you can see the improvement of the debt profile in which the percentage of bank borrowings is increasing compared to bank borrowings long-term compared with the short-term. In terms of maturities, we are having more than half of the debt, which is with maturities more than five years.\nThis is the slide related to the distribution of dividends that we have also presented in the past. It's a matter about after passing this period with the support scheme when we needed to get a lot of loans to finance the network losses and the finance of support scheme, the amounts to be recuperated from the state. As we are starting to develop also the production, we will consider getting back to levels of yield of dividends similar with what it was in the past. To be the summary, we will welcome now your questions, and together with my colleagues and our team here, we will focus to answer to you as good as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please note that for those participating via the webcast, kindly follow the instructions indicated and either type your question via the box or dial into the audio conference. At this time, we'll begin the audio question-and-answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star followed by one on their telephone. If you wish to remove yourself from the question queue, then you may press star and two. For those participating in the question-and-answer session, please use your handset when asking your question for better quality. Anyone who has a question may press star and one at this time. One moment for the first question, please. The first question comes from the line of Andrei Ioana with UniCredit Bank. Please go ahead. Ms. Andrei, can you hear me?\n\nAndrei Ioana\n\nAnalyst, UniCredit Bank\n\nHi. Good afternoon and congratulations for the result. Hi. I can hear you. Can you hear me?\n\nOperator\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nPlease.\n\nAndrei Ioana\n\nAnalyst, UniCredit Bank\n\nGreat. I will start with my first question regarding the supply performance after the end of the capping scheme. We've seen a very unusual high EBITDA margin in Q3. Could you please detail what drove the margin so high? Maybe you can give us guidance. Where do you see margins consolidating in the near term? Second, if you could comment also on the supply volumes. The volumes decreased two consecutive quarters. Do you see some changes in demand, or this is just because of competition? Please give us your view on the supply volumes.\nMy last question is regarding the media rumors that you are interested in the acquisition of Distribu?ie Oltenia. Have you submitted a non-binding offer for the acquisition of Oltenia? If you could, please give us something here. If you do plan to pursue this acquisition, what financing sources do you consider? Thank you. That's all from my side.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nIn terms of the revenues on the volumes for the supply, strong discussion here. Even if we have a decrease of 3% of the volumes on the supply, as you can see in the slide, we don't necessarily consider this as a warning signal for us. From our point of view, in this market, our focus is to optimize our activities and to be as profitable and as efficient as possible. It will not necessarily be a battle of fighting for the market quota. I think that the focus for the supply is the one which is to optimize your activity, to have a relationship with your customers, which to be stable. We are not that much affected about the customers which are migrating to other players.\nThere is, for sure, migration, but in the end, I think that the fact that the market got liberalized showed that this is in the benefit of everyone, and it's a way of functioning which we are prepared, we are resilient, and we will be continuing to be prepared there. There is also the benefit that, as I previously mentioned, in our areas where we have mostly our customers in our supply area, people are not so keen to just chase very little, any little difference in price and change the supplier, but they are more focused on having a steady relationship with a reliable supplier. Now, in terms of the other questions, I think Alexandru will help you with them.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nRegarding the question about the acquisition, you saw that we are at this time at the beginning on securing the financing. We got the principal approval from the shareholders, and now we're working on the fact that we have to secure the financing. We will have you informed as soon as possible on what we have there as an offer and what we can achieve. Regarding acquisitions of other alternative groups, again, we are pursuing interests that are convergent with the business lines of Electrica, and as soon as we have something to announce, we will do so through the proper channels, through the stock market, and we will let the investors know exactly what we are planning.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nYeah. As previously also mentioned, there is in the note for the GMS which was approved, you have all the details there. We have this plan of growing the business. At a certain point, you are looking at growing the business organically, which is what we are doing, for example, with the production, and so on. At a certain point, you might take a look also at unorganic options to grow the business because we have economies of scale and synergies, and from this point of view, we are looking at opportunities which are related with our main object of activity as stipulated in the note for the GMS for which we got approval last week.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nIs there a follow-up question, or we proceed?\n\nRaluca Kasap\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Electrica\n\nThank you. If I may.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nPlease.\n\nRaluca Kasap\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Electrica\n\nYes. I have one more question, if I may. Regarding the net position at the end of September, in your presentation, you have a RON 4.2 billion net position lower versus 2024. Well, from my computation, including bonds should be higher. Is anything there included?\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nWe should maybe take a look at the computation, then we can take a look separately with you. The idea is that from the bond, we have placed some T-bills, but we have also reduced the exposure on some credit lines. Let's take a look at the numbers separately, and we can help with clarifying this.\n\nAndrei Ioana\n\nAnalyst, UniCredit Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further audio questions at this time. I will now pass the floor to Electrica Management.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nOkay. Let's take it one by one.\n\nRaluca Kasap\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Electrica\n\nWe have some questions. We have some questions.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nOkay. Let's take the first. When will we give out numbers regarding revenues and net results for the production of energy from renewables? I think they are on slide 28, and you also have them separately in the financials. If ?tefan, you can go to 28.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nYeah. Let's go to 28, and we have here the evolution of the, so we are monitoring the Production segment since five years already, and we have here all the details related to the production and the fact that it starts to contribute significantly to the EBITDA as a net result. We have also the details in the note for the financial situation. We have a specific note related to the segments. It's note five in the financials, which is detailing the segment. Also, there is a question about if 70.6% of the revenues are from the Supply and 38.6% are from the Distribution. Where comes the rest?\nI will also refer to this, not five, and I will mention that 0.1% is coming from the segment of Production. It's this RON 8 million that we see here, and then there is some 0.7% which is coming from the segment of Energy Services, roughly RON 50 million. This would explain the difference.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nGoing forward, regarding the memorandum with Romgaz for the 400 MW target, we are working on a strategy with Romgaz, and we will come back shortly with the outline. We're looking for the best way we can have a synergy between us and develop the renewables as fast as possible. The question regarding the dividends that will be paid from the net profit of last year. Now, the discussion with the dividends is strictly related to the net debt cash position that we have. We still have a lot of receivables to receive from the state.\nUntil we stabilize this situation, it is hard to make a decision on dividends as we need to borrow money in order to pay the dividends, and it seems unreasonable. We're trying to maintain a higher and higher value for the dividends. We're working with the Board for a dividend policy that is much clearer. As stated before, it is in our intent to get back to dividend yield stock, but we need to do this from a secure position that does not put in jeopardy any investments that we are currently doing.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nWe are not looking at the percentage of the net profit. We are just looking at the situation with the plans, with the businesses that we want to develop, the investment plans, the liquidity that we have, and from this point of view, this is how we are considering for the dividends. In terms of the question related to the network of distribution, we can say that roughly 35% of the overall network is already modernized. I think this was another question that we got.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nRoughly, we have around 35% of the installation that, sorry, we didn't quite have the question. The question is regarding the distribution network. What percentage is modernized and has a low loss and CPT number, I guess, is the actual question. We are roughly at 35%, and we're working tirelessly to improve all these segments. The main goal is to have better quality, better service, and, again, lower losses. It will take time. There is an approved ANRE plan. It is for the next decade. We are in line. We always say that we are already doing the best we can, and we can do more, but it's part of a negotiation because it's related with the tariffs, and we need to see that through.\nThere is another question regarding a possible error on the revenues consolidated at 70.6% with a difference of 20.6%, and there is a difference of 0.8%.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nIt's not an error. I have explained before. This is 0.1% coming from the Production and another 0.7% coming from the Supply segment. There is a question about the year-end level. The question about the impairment of receivables. It's not necessarily increasing sharply in the Q3 2025. There is a methodology that we are looking to revise according to IFRS 9 about how these are calculated and which should be adjusted to reflect the market situation. It's not like there is a cash collection issue. There are no cash collection issues.\nThe amount comprises both adversary amounts, but also the ones according to IFRS 9, which are linked with the receivables balances. If receivables balances are increasing, there is also an increase in that. The level for the end of the year will be similar with Q3 2025. There will not be another jump.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nOkay. Going forward, if the revenues obtained from the energy producer, from renewables, from green certificates drop or increases depending on the energy input/output. Now, the green certificates were part of a scheme that only applied to a certain point. For new capacities, we don't have this situation. They're fairly stable on what we have, with a possible very low decrease on, let's say, the usage of the parks per se. Now we have the CapEx guidance from this year.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nYeah. Well, I'll be taking that. The point is this. You should.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nWe should ask the question. What is the CapEx for this year and next year? On the remaining 2 billion subsidies receivable, how much do we expect to collect this year and how much next year? What is the driver for increasing EBITDA in the Distribution segment? As I was assuming, it was to remain stable given the WACC has not changed.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nYeah. Basically, as a guidance, we can give you a CapEx guidance for distribution until the end of this regulatory period. Basically, we should expect roughly at least EUR 150 million in equivalent as a distribution CapEx by the end of this regulatory period. This is starting from the idea that we need, according to the regulation, to invest at minimum the regulated depreciation, and then we can add maybe some 5%, 10%. This would be the minimum. We could have probably an effort to put more and go up to EUR 200 million in the next year, 2026 and 2027. Altogether, it's okay, minimum EUR 750 million cumulated for five years. The same thing is for the generation.\nYeah. For the generation, we are looking roughly at EUR 350 million by 2027. There is a two-step approach: commissioning and starting to have generation, EBITDA, and energy produced from these projects, and then have a second step. This would be in terms of CapEx. In terms of the remaining RON 2 billion receivables that we have in the financial situation at mid-year, as I mentioned, we collected some RON 944 million round up to this year so far. We expect to receive another amount which should cost the collections above RON 1 billion for this year, and the rest of the amount, roughly another RON 1 billion for next year.\nWe are in communication with the authorities on this topic. They know about the topic and about the fact that we need to get this amount recuperated, and we do not necessarily see an issue about that. I mean, if you look historically, out of RON 7 billion that we have filed in for recuperation, we got rebates like RON 6 billion so far. There is a delay, but there is the willingness to find solutions and to have this rebate.\nWhat is the driver for increase of EBITDA in the distribution segment? I was assuming it was to remain stable given the WACC has not changed. From this point of view, there is also a matter about improving our efficiency, first of all. You can see this also in this year, and compared with the previous years, we are posting significant improvements of EBITDA in the distribution, paying more attention to how we unfold our activities, and focusing on reducing network losses and optimizing on everything that exists in our activity.\nThere is also this profile in which, in the course of a regulatory period, when you agree with the regulator for a five-year period, generally what happens is that there is this profile in which you have less profitability at the beginning of the years, and then you are having increased profitability towards the end of the period.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nJust to complete what you were saying, for the Distribution segment, we have roughly EUR 150 million per year minimum. That adds up with the 100, I think EUR 400 million from EU funding, which is actually increasing. As more calls open, we apply to more. That is roughly for the Distribution segment. For the Renewable segment, keep in mind that we have 2030 target. 2030 target is 1 GW of renewables, which is roughly EUR 700 million by 2030, and the 1 GW of batteries should be roughly around EUR 350 million. It's like EUR 1 billion investment by 2030 on the energy production segment. I don't know if we have another question.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, to register for a question, please press star and one on your telephone, or type your question via the box on the webcast.\n\n?tefan Frangulea\n\nCFO, Electrica\n\nThere is a question about the increase of recognition of imbalances from 5% to 10%. Is the permanent warrant temporary? It was during the support scheme. It was improving our result, our recognition from 1 April 2025 until end of the support scheme for the energy, 30 June 2025. After 1 July 2025, we don't have the support scheme anymore, so we don't have any gap in terms of recognizing the imbalances caused in terms of having them recuperated from the customers. This was a matter which was related to the support scheme, and we benefited for the last quarter of the support scheme of this increase.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor to management for any closing comments. Thank you.\n\nAlexandru Chiri??\n\nCEO, Electrica\n\nLet's have another time. Maybe someone wants to ask a question for this. Otherwise, we are available for any related questions that you may have. You can contact Raluca or the executive team at any point. We will happily answer. We will keep you updated on any news as fast as possible, and we're optimistic on how things are going.\nWe're keeping the work going as hard as we can. Let's wait one more minute.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you for calling, and have a good evening."

This is Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. Thank you for joining EssilorLuxottica Q1 Revenue Management Call. The group CFO, Stefano Grassi, will elaborate about the revenue drivers of the first quarter of the year.\n[Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I hand it over to Stefano.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 2025 results. We are here today to comment an excellent start of 2025 despite macro environment that is clearly more uncertain than ever seen in recent years. EssilorLuxottica delivered a first quarter with revenue up 7.3% constant currency and 8.1% at current exchange results. Asia Pacific was up double digit, while EMEA delivered a 9.9% top line growth at constant currency. Latin America was approximately 9% and our North America region delivered a mid-single-digit quarter with a 4% top line growth. .\nThe impact of the 2 recently acquired Heidelberg Engineer and Supreme accounts for about 2 percentage points in our top line growth profile. So even excluding those from our revenue growth, you will be looking at an underlying company marching at a mid-single-digit pace, very consistent with the long-term guidance that we shared with you between 2022 and 2026.\nMoving to FX now. Let me just share that in Q1, currencies created finally, I would say, some tailwinds in our numbers with about 1 percentage point of difference between constant and current exchange. And the main reason for that is the revaluation of the U.S. dollar against euro year-over-year, which was approximately 3% during the course of the first quarter. Unfortunately, those tailwinds will vanish if currencies stay at those levels throughout the second quarter onwards. And that is mainly due to the recent devaluation of the U.S. dollar against euro.\nNow before starting our journey across the 4 regions, let me just give you a quick update on Nuance Audio. The breakthrough innovations, which has been recently launched in the United States, in Italy and just a few days ago in France. The product in itself is now available in 4,700 doors between direct-to-consumer and our B2B channel, with very encouraging results. It's a bit premature to talk about numbers now, but let me share that consumer feedback are extremely enthusiastic in both North America as well as in Europe. So stay tuned for more news in the upcoming quarters.\nBut now let me move through the 4 different regions. And as usual, let's begin with the largest one, North America. In the region, we had a solid quarter on the direct-to-consumer that delivered high single-digit quarter while the Professional Solutions side of the business was flat year-over-year. In the B2B, we experienced a strong quarter in our key accounts, and I would say that is true for both lenses and frames. While our independent channel were actually negative on the first quarter, in particular, due to some softness on the lens business.\nFrom a frame business standpoint, Ray-Ban was up double digit, very much driven by a strong Ray-Ban Meta and also by a stronger prescription business of Ray-Ban. On the luxury side, we probably put on the spotlight 2 brands Miu Miu and CHANEL.\nIf we now move to the lens. On the land side, we had a strong and positive single vision lenses, while the progressive part of our business -- of our lens business was actually flattish year-over-year. And I would say the main reason is on the ECP side. We have seen, in particular with Varilux that ECP were kind of waiting for the launch of the upcoming Varilux [indiscernible] that will hit the North American market between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of Q3.\nOn top of that, I would say Nikon was solid positive mid-single-digit growth. Shamir had an excellent quarter with high single-digit growth in Q1. Very last touch on price mix. Price mix was positive, was positive in lenses, was positive in frames. And I would say this is something very consistent with what we've seen in the last few quarters for Professional Solutions North America.\nNow let's move to direct-to-consumer. We're kicking off 2025 in an excellent manner. We were mid-single-digit comp sales in Sunglass Hut and high single-digit comps in optical retail. Sunglass Hut is a very consistent trajectory of what we've seen in the last few months with stronger comp sales growth and that's obviously very pleasing because we remember that Sunglass [ Akim ], from a trajectory of tough and negative comp sales for quite a while. And now we're very pleasing to see from the last quarter of 2024, and now in Q1, a very strong and consistent pace for our retail banner in North America.\nOn the optical side, LensCrafter was high single-digit comps. We had positive traffic. We had a very strong conversion and the growth was very much driven by positive volume. Target Optical, high single-digit comps, while Pearle Vision was actually on the mid-single-digit delivery from a comp sales standpoint. So a very compelling picture of our retail proposition, both optical and sun. And the positive thing that I can tell you right now is that April is very much continuing on the same pace.\nNow let's move to another important region, Europe, EMEA, that is 9.9% up at constant currency. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the EMEA region. Couple of legs here. Professional Solutions delivered a high single-digit quarter while our direct-to-consumer channel was up double digit.\nAll the countries in the region were solid positive in Q1, with Germany that was double digit with U.K., that was double digit with Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Middle East that were double digit. Italy delivered high single-digit quarter. So you can see a widespread positive and strong trend across all the countries in the region. On Professional Solutions side, a few comments on the different channels. Independents were solid positive in Q1, with the key accounts, they were up double digit and with e-commerce partners that were up on a high single-digit territory.\nOur premium lens portfolio delivered another outstanding quarter, and that is very much confirming the fact that the appreciation of our -- of the market for our brands, whether it's Nikon, Varilux, Eyezen or Transition, it's all there. And the positive thing is that the growth was very much driven by volume.\nNow let's switch channel. Let's move to direct to consumer. Happy to report another remarkable quarter for both optical and sun. Both the channel, sun and optical deliver high single-digit comp sales. On the optical banners, I would put on the spotlight 2 banners, Salmoiraghi & Vigano and Apollo, they both delivered double-digit comps. That was very much driven by a strong retail execution and an excellent service level for both of them. On the [ Sanmina ] part, I would highlight U.K. that despite a negative traffic did really well on conversion and mix management.\nNow the third region on the pipeline is Asia Pacific. Double-digit growth, 10.4% at constant currency, a great start to the year for the Asia Pacific region, second consecutive quarter at double-digit pace. Japan and Korea were double-digit while Greater China, India and Southeast Asia delivered a mid-single-digit speed in Q1. If we look at for a second, a bit closely China, I would say that consumer spending in China was still under pressure in Q1. So not really a material change from what we commented during the second half of 2024. But the positive thing is here is that the Vision Care part of our business is clearly showing strong resilience throughout the quarter. And in this environment, I would say, we are very happy with the Myopia solutions that deliver a growth at about 30% in Q1 and now represent 26% of the revenue base in Greater China.\nThe key driver of this performance, as usual, is Stellest, and we've seen that happening consistently in the last few years, but also the other alternative technology, the DOT 1 that has been developed in partnership with CooperVision and is now distributed through the brand of Nikon and Kodak. Outside the myopia solution, well, Belong was slightly weak due to a soft sell-out on the B2B side, while Oakley and the overall luxury portfolio were very strong, delivering a double-digit quarter.\nIf we move now to direct-to-consumer. The almost 1,600 stores that we have in the region did well in Q1 with mid-single-digit optical comps, very much driven by a strong OPSM and the Mainland China optical banners that deliver a strong comp sales in Q1. 2 brands like Oakley and Ray-Ban were actually very strong in Japan, and the retail banners underneath those brands actually delivered an outstanding quarter at a double-digit pace in Japan.\nNow moving to Latin America. 9.2% growth at constant currency, 17 consecutive quarter of positive growth in the LatAm region at constant currency. Two things I would highlight here. First one, Brazil. You remember Q4 last year was a tough quarter for Brazil. But during our last call on 5/12, I wanted to reassure you that we were entering in 2025 with a different trajectory in Brazil. And here we are. Brazil delivered a double-digit quarter driven by Sunglass Hut and Oakley retail that were both up double digit with OchecaCarol and Photoche that delivered mid-single-digit growth with our B2B frame business that was up double digit, and the lens part of our business, B2B was up mid-single digit.\nAnd let me say that in this respect, the introduction of transition -- in the market in Brazil during the end of last year, early this year was definitely instrumental to get the proper strong trajectory in the region.\nLet's touch on the retail banners. The delivery for the rest of the region, outside Brazil, I would say, was remarkable in Q1. GMO and the GrandVision banner delivered high single-digit comps while Stan shined on our Sunglass Hut Mexican banners with mid-single-digit comp sales, very much driven by strong airport location, and I would probably mention today the Cancun 1 that show all our Sunglass Hut location up on the double-digit pace.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator for the Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nHello. On today's webcast are Stephane de La Faverie, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Akhil Shrivastava, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSince many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nTo facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nAs a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. Throughout our discussion, our profit recovery and growth plan will be referred to as our PRGP. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this webcast.\nAnd now I'll turn the webcast over to Stephane.\n\nStephane de la Faverie\n\nExecutive Group President\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. Akhil and I are pleased to be with you today for our first earnings call as CFO and CEO of The Estée Lauder Companies. We are incredibly honored to lead our iconic company, defined by our core values and portfolio of [ build-up ] brands. Having met with many employees, retailers, business partners, investors and other stakeholders since being named CEO 3 months ago, I am more convinced than ever that our fundamentals are strong.\nWe have a strong foundation to leverage given our brand equities, high-quality products and exceptional talent. Our focus is clear: restore sustainable sales growth and achieved a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years as we aim to become the best consumer-centric prestige beauty company.\nLet me begin by reflecting on the drivers of our challenged performance over the last few years, before turning to how we plan to realize our ambition for much improved results. Subdued consumer sentiment in China greatly pressured the prestige beauty industry and our business. Given our strategically strong share in prestige beauty with the Chinese consumer, we were disproportionally impacted.\nAt the same time, the increasing complexity of our organization, coupled with a narrow focus on too few markets and channels to drive growth prevented us from tapping into the prevailing strength of prestige beauty around the world. This was especially true in North America.\nSimply said, we lost our agility. We did not capitalize on the higher growth opportunities quickly enough in channels, markets, media and prestige price tiers, nor fuel new consumer acquisition aggressively enough.\nWe also did not deliver sufficient levels of on-trend innovation in our time to market, often put us behind trend. This happened as prestige beauty become nimbler, driven by both incumbents and new entrants as we learn with our own indie brand The Ordinary, along with faster-moving consumers magnifying our issues.\nCompounding matters, lower sales in higher-margin areas of our business coincided with our overall expense base becoming too large as we invested in capabilities ahead of growth that didn't materialize.\nOur bold new strategic vision of Beauty Reimagined is designed to address these factors to restore sustainable sales growth and deliver a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years. We are reimagining our operating model to be leaner, faster and more agile through the biggest transformation in our history to best serve consumers globally.\nBeauty Reimagined has 5 action plan priorities to achieve our vision. First, accelerate best-in-class consumer coverage. We are going to put the consumer at the heart of our business. To do so, we plan to rapidly expand our portfolio presence in consumer-preferred high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to fully participate in the growth opportunities of prestige beauty.\nWe have numerous areas in which to capitalize, geographically in the U.S., the U.K. and emerging markets; and by channel from travel retail in Western markets to online platforms, specialty multi globally and pharmacies in Europe. By doing so, we expect to better diversify our growth drivers.\nSecond, create transformative innovation. We aim to deliver fast-to-market on-trend innovation with an eye towards in-demand subcategories, benefits and occasions. For instance, there are several dynamic subcategories in Skin Care like body, of makeup like multi-benefit [ Leap ] products, and of fragrance like lifestyle for home for our brands to either enter or expand.\nWe will innovate across price tiers from entry prestige to luxury, making sure to bring products to market at attractive price points for new consumer acquisition. As we look to step-change our innovation, we are committed to tripling the percentage of our innovation that is launched in less than a year.\nThird, boost consumer-facing investments to accelerate new consumer acquisition. First and foremost, we plan to do this by increasing visible advertising spending, optimizing marketing programs and eliminating current A&P spending that is unproductive. Moreover, this also includes greater investment in selling to support our freestanding store acceleration for our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands to drive growth.\nFourth, fuel sustainable growth through [ bold ] efficiencies with today's announcement of our now expanded PRGP. We've made significant progress to date in PRGP, having delivered over 60% of our fiscal 2025 objective in the first half of the fiscal year. This has primarily been driven by addressing elevated excess and obsolescence, realizing strategic pricing through fewer discounts, lowering professional service expenses and restructuring our workforce.\nHowever, greater expense reduction is necessary. We have experienced further volume deleverage since the planned inception, driven by moderated industry growth projection and geopolitical uncertainty as well as the company-specific issues I've described. We must redesign our expense structure for an evolving mix of business, to better align with prestige beauty growth drivers and given the significant changes in the travel retail industry.\nWe're embarking on our biggest operational transformation in our company's history, enabled by now an expanded PRGP. We are redesigning how much and where we stand, further rationalizing our nonconsumer-facing investments and significantly evolving our operating model to be more efficient.\nThe new areas we have identified in adopting a more competitive approach to procurement, improving supply chain network efficiencies and outsourcing of select services, the latter of which we plan to do with proven global partners. We are advancing well in the design of the outsourcing program with our potential partners.\nWe are laser-focused on rightsizing expenses with the dual mandate to meaningfully reinvest in consumer-facing initiatives, to drive top line growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years. And as we return to delivering sustainable sales growth, we will be positioned once again to realize operating leverage to further improve profitability. We plan to give more detail on our growth algorithm once we have more fully operationalized the action plan priorities of Beauty Reimagined.\nFifth, reimagine the way we work. We are removing complexity and simplifying our organization. In doing so, we will provide for greater focus on execution excellence for the consumer. Moreover, we are unburdening our smaller brands so they can be more successful in a large organization, while driving greater benefits of scale for our larger brands.\nAs we make these changes, we will amp up our faster decision-making in part through a flatter and leaner organization. The foundation of our Beauty Reimagined strategic vision is a new framework where we are clear on our strengths so that we can more optimally allocate resources. Our strengths are where we will lead and excel: brand desirability, consumer experience, innovation, quality and end-to-end execution.\nIn support of our strengths and for certain other areas of our business, we are hardwiring AI through the organization. We are in an exciting moment in time for the company with AI as we have been working with the best-in-class technology partners. Their resources, technology and investments combined with our use cases and proprietary data are enabling us to deploy AI in a cost-effective manner to drive efficiencies with high-quality and differentiated output.\nAs one example, we are leveraging AI to forecast our demand and plan for our material and production needs, which has resulted in our weighted average forecast accuracy reaching new heights. This better synchronize our demand and supply and delivers significant improvement in inventories, added proof that the initiatives that we are deploying to restore stronger operating margins are sustainable.\nWe are ready to dramatically scale the integration of AI into our workflows from product development to marketing, supply chain, back office and beyond to accelerate processes and improve decision-making.\nWhat's most exciting, we expect AI to free up resources to unleash even greater creativity by our brand teams for the consumer. As part of the expanded PRGP, we also plan to work with other external partners to outsource areas of our business that are not core to where we want to lead and excel.\nSince I became CEO, we've moved quickly to jumpstart Beauty Reimagined in my first 30 days. First, we announced this morning, we established a new consumer-centric executive team through a combination of elevated top talent internally and recruiting externally. The new flatter, leaner team structure and governance model are designed to significantly improve collaboration and speed of decision-making, with clear accountability across brands, regions and functions in support of our action plan priorities.\nSecond, and as I said a few minutes ago, we strategically expanded PRGP, including its restructuring program, with the full support of our Board of Directors. This was a decision we did not take lightly, and it will result in a reduction of several thousand additional positions.\nThird, we dramatically simplified certain work streams across brands, regions and functions to enable teams to focus more on external execution to drive sales growth.\nAs we execute Beauty Reimagined, we are bracing a test and learn mentality. When we see an early win, we will endeavor to move with speed to scale it. Conversely, we will seek to move quickly to exit what's not working. We are putting a new organizational structure in place to empower colleagues to act as owners as we improve communication, accountability and collaboration to be more decisive and faster to action.\nEncouragingly, as demonstrated in the second quarter, we have some momentum on which to build across the 5 action plan priorities of Beauty Reimagined. As we accelerate best-in-class consumer coverage, 9 brands have now launched on the U.S. Amazon Premium Beauty stores, including the successful launch of The Ordinary in January.\nLast March, Clinique was our first brand to launch on Amazon storefront. At which time, it also doubled down on its authentic dermatologist heritage with strong commercial execution across all channels. Given Clinique's resounding success in the U.S. demonstrated by 8 consecutive months of prestige beauty share gain through December, it launched in Canada, Amazon Premium Beauty stores during the second quarter.\nAcross markets, in Asia Pacific, we continued to build our presence on TikTok Shop, Line and Shopee with more brands launching in some markets on these high-growth platforms. And we are thrilled that The Ordinary is debuting in Mainland China this month with its proven disruptive launch strategy.\nWe also realized excellent results as we extended the reach of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand with our experiential in-store offerings, led by Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malleas each delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth.\nAs we deliver our plans to create transformative innovation, Clinique, Estée Lauder and La Mer strategic launches for the nighttime usage occasion demonstrate the gains we can deliver where we have the right to play and win. In Mainland China, La Mer grew in retail, in contrast to the industry's decline in prestige skin care, driven by its new rejuvenated nice.\nClinique CX, the brand's new advanced post-procedure treatment franchise for China further epitomizes our aspirations. Clinique CX debuted in November at the Chinese Dermatologist Association with Medical Device 2 classification after less than 12 months development from concept to launch.\nWe also announced the opening of a new BioTech Hub in Belgium in December and the collaboration with MIT in January to further accelerate the company's cutting-edge biotechnology innovations.\nFinally, we saw the fruits of our labor when we boosted consumer-facing investment to reach new audiences, as seen by Jo Malone London's significant growth with men in the second quarter.\nBefore I close, I want to speak briefly about our third quarter outlook. While we are not satisfied with our third quarter outlook, it primarily reflects weak retail sales trend in our Asia travel retail business, which deteriorated in the second quarter driven by Korea. While our retail sales trends in [ Hainan ] were still negative in the second quarter, they improved sequentially, fueled by our retail activations.\nFor the third quarter, we expect overall soft retail trends to persist in Asia travel retail, significantly pressuring our organic net sales despite the improvement we made with our in-trade inventory levels in the first half of fiscal 2025, which we intend to maintain across current levels.\nIn order to reignite our retail sales growth, we are strategically increasing consumer-facing investments around the world in the third quarter. We expect the benefits of the PRGP to both fund these investments and modestly offset the meaningful operating deleverage from the sales decline.\nIn closing, while we have much work to do, we are confident that Beauty Reimagined is the way to realize our ambition to restore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years.\nTo our employees, thank you for your passion and contribution at this pivotal moment in our company's history. I am grateful for all the ideas that you've shared with me over the past months, and I'm energized for what we can achieve together. This is our shared vision.\nI will now turn the call over to Akhil.\n\nAkhil Shrivastava\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Stephane, and hello, everyone. It's an honor to be with you today in my new role as CFO of The Estée Lauder Companies. I'm energized to partner with Stephane as we boldly drive the execution of Beauty Reimagined, our transformative strategic vision.\nWhile we've made progress with initiatives under our PRGP, we recognize there's still much to accomplish. As we collaborate with our global teams to simplify processes and execute with speed and agility, we are confident we can achieve a leaner cost structure through significantly expanding our PRGP. We believe this evolution positions us to invest more in consumer-centric activities that drive recruitment and fuel sustainable profitable growth and cash generation for the long term.\nI'll discuss this in more detail shortly. But first, let me recap our second quarter results, covering overall performance, organic net sales by region and product category, margin, cash flows, restructuring charges and other items.\nOrganic net sales declined 6%, at the high end of the outlook range we gave in October. Adjusted EPS was $0.62 in the quarter, exceeding our outlook. This reflects better-than-expected gross margin expansion given a higher-than-expected category mix in skincare. It also reflects disciplined expense management, while we continue to invest in consumer-facing activities to support growth in key areas of the business.\nStarting with our regions. In Asia Pacific, net sales decreased 11%, primarily driven by double-digit declines in Mainland China, Korea and Hong Kong SAR, mainly due to subdued consumer sentiment. The decline in Korea also reflects our November 2024 exit of Dr.Jart from the travel retail channel as well as the impacts of recent political and social unrest. These declines were partially offset by double-digit organic net sales growth in Japan, where both domestic and traveling consumers continue to fuel growth across nearly all channels of distribution.\nOrganic net sales in EMEA fell 6%. This reflects continued retail softness in our Asia travel retail business, which resulted in lower replenishment orders. Organic net sales were flat in the Americas. This was mainly due to the 1% decline in North America where we still have relatively high exposure in slower growth channels. This was partially offset by double-digit online sales growth, which included early shipments for The Ordinary's launch in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store in January.\nMoving on to product categories. Organic net sales decreased 12% in Skin Care and 8% in Hair Care. The challenges in Asia Pacific and our Asia travel retail business have the greatest effect on our Skin Care category. This more than offset the sales growth we saw in the Americas led by double-digit growth from The Ordinary. In makeup, organic net sales decreased 1%. The collective decline from TOM FORD, M·A·C and Smashbox more than offset the high single-digit growth from Clinique's launched last March and Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store.\nFragrance organic net sales increased 2%. Le Labo continued to excel with strong double-digit sales growth across all geographic regions driven by [ HEDO ] products and innovation.\nNow turning to our margins. For the quarter, our gross margin expanded 310 basis points compared to last year. This reflects net benefits from our PRGP that drove the reduction in excess and obsolescence, lower discounts, benefits from our strategic pricing actions and operational efficiencies.\nOperating expenses increased 500 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter. This reflects a 210 basis points increase in advertising, promotion and innovation expenses. This includes our investments to fuel performance during holiday and key shopping moments and drive consumer engagement for new product launches.\nWe also saw an increase of 130 basis points from higher selling expense. This reflects higher costs to support key activations including during holiday and our distribution expansion.\nAnd our sales deleverage offset the net benefits realized under the PRGP. I'll expand on this later.\nOperating income decreased 20% to $462 million, and our operating margin contracted 200 basis points to 11.5% compared to 13.5% last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 42.6%, compared to 37.7% last year. The increase is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of previously issued stock-based compensation and a change in a global mix of earnings.\nDiluted EPS was $0.62, compared to $0.88 last year. As of December 31, we have recorded $403 million of charges under our PRGP restructuring program. These charges primarily relate to initiatives aimed at transforming various functions, brands and regions.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded $861 million of impairment charges related to TOM FORD and Too Faced. This reflects challenges in Asia Pacific and our Asia travel retail business for TOM FORD and continued underperformance from Too Faced. The increase in the weighted average cost of capital also contributed to the impairment charges for both brands.\nMoving now to our cash generation, CapEx investments and dividend payments. For the 6 months, we generated $387 million in net cash flows from operating activities, compared to $937 million last year. Lower net cash flows from operations this year as compared to last year is due to the decrease in earnings adjusted for noncash items and an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities. This includes the fact that last year, we made a very significant year-on-year reduction in our inventory.\nWe invested $273 million in capital expenditures compared to $527 million last year. The reduction in capital expenditures was primarily driven by the prior-year payments relating to the manufacturing facility in Japan. It also reflects the improvements we have made to optimize expenditures as we are determined to improve our free cash flow.\nTurning to dividends. We returned $366 million in cash to stockholders.\nLooking ahead, to harness the full growth potential of our strategic vision as we transform how we operate and invest in our business, we must boldly pivot with a consumer-centric mindset, focused on cost discipline, optimizing our resources for growth and fueling consumer-facing investments to further ignite our brands.\nNow I'm going to elaborate on our PRGP that is a critical enabler of this strategic vision. We have made significant progress in executing our plan thus far. While we remain on track to deliver the previously communicated $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in net benefits, the current headwinds we are facing are now expected to partially offset these benefits.\nTo date, the net benefits we have realized thus far have been more than offset by our operating deleverage. Our profitability has been pressured by our sales volume declines: mix, ongoing inflation and a cost base that was scaled in anticipation of growth that did not materialize. We have also continued to invest in consumer-facing activities and distribution expansion to fuel sustainable growth.\nTo address these challenges and accelerate our return to sustainable sales growth and profitability, we have made the decision to further expand the PRGP, including its restructuring program. Anchored by the 5 key action plans Stephane discussed, the expanded PRGP is essential to our operational transformation, fueling investments for growth, not ahead of it. We are focused on improving operational efficiencies, optimizing our cost structure to be leaner and enhancing leverage across the business, especially during periods of volatility and low sales growth.\nThis transformation enables us to reallocate resources, allowing us to better prioritize and increase consumer-facing investments. By doing so, we are better positioned to address changes in our mix of business whether driven by internal or external factors.\nRelated, we have made the difficult decision to expand our restructuring program. With all initiatives under the program, we now expect a net reduction of 5,800 to 7,000 positions globally, including approvals to date. Approvals for specific initiatives under this restructuring program in total are still expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026.\nIn the now expanded restructuring program, we expect to take total charges of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion and generate annual gross savings of $800 million to $1 billion before taxes. A portion of these savings is expected to be reinvested in consumer-centric activities and additional investments to fuel growth.\nThe actions under the PRGP, including its restructuring program, are expected to be substantially executed in fiscal '25 and '26 and completed in fiscal '27. We expect nearly all of the full run rate benefits to be realized during fiscal '27.\nOverall, we aim to accelerate our return to sustainable sales growth and deliver a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years. We are moving with a sense of urgency to execute the action plans of Beauty Reimagined to start delivering annual sales and margin improvement quickly. As Stephane said, we plan to share more details once the Beauty Reimagined action plans are operationalized.\nLet me now discuss our outlook. We expect our business to continue to be challenged by subdued consumer sentiment in China and Korea, pressuring Asia travel retail. In light of this, along with evolving global geopolitical uncertainty, we anticipate continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As a result, we are only providing an outlook for the third quarter.\nWe expect a strong double-digit sales decline in our global travel retail business in the second half of the fiscal year. This reflects shipments based on our expectation of persistent industry retail softness and incremental pressure from the change in selling policies at several Korean retailers. Additionally, recall that we resumed replenishment orders in the third quarter last year, making for a difficult comparison.\nHowever, we are encouraged that, for the second quarter, our retail trends, while still negative, improved sequentially in both Mainland China and globally, excluding travel retail. We anticipate our retail sales trends, excluding travel retail, to significantly improve in the third quarter as we increase consumer-facing investments.\nGiven that context, let me walk you through our specific outlook for the third quarter. We expect organic net sales for our third quarter to decrease 10% to 8% compared to last year. As I previously mentioned, this is primarily driven by a strong double-digit decline in our global travel retail business. In the rest of the business, we expect the net sales decline to moderate. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact reported net sales by 2 percentage points.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate moderate gross margin expansion, reflecting a tailwind from the in-period charge last year, which was triggered by the previous pull-down of production. We also expect continued benefits from the PRGP as an offset to our expected sales volume deleverage and continued consumer-facing investments.\nWe expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 36%, compared to 30.5% last year. The increase primarily reflects the estimated change in our geographical mix of earnings. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.20 to $0.30, primarily driven by the expected strong sales decline in global travel retail. Currency translation is expected to dilute EPS by $0.04.\nIn closing, we acknowledge that we have a lot of hard work ahead. But we are empowered by a Beauty Reimagined vision. With its mandate to pivot boldly with the consumer-centric mindset, speed and agility, we are confident and better positioned to accelerate our return to sustainable sales growth and long-term profitability.\nOn behalf of Stephane and our new leadership team, I want to extend a heartfelt gratitude to our talented employees around the world. Together with you, we are driving the critical transformation to unlock the full potential of our beloved company.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

This is Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. Thank you for joining EssilorLuxottica Full year 2024 Results Management Call. The Group's Chairman and CEO, Francesco Milleri; the Deputy CEO, Paul du Saillant; and the CFO, Stefano Grassi, will walk you through the business and financial highlights of last year. [Operator Instructions] With that, I hand it over to Francesco.\n\nFrancesco Milleri\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nWelcome, everybody. I'm happy to reconnect with you to present the sound financial performance of 2024 and give you an update on our strategic initiatives in smart glasses and hearing aids. EssilorLuxottica's revenue broadly maintain the sound pace of the past years with the fourth quarter at 9% and the full year at 6%. This came on the back of the sound organic growth of our business, supported by the solid trajectory of the eye care eyewear activities and boosted by the new category of wearable.\nM&A gave a little extra contribution in the fourth quarter. I'd like to say a few words on Supreme, which continued to successfully execute its strategy after the consolidation in EssilorLuxottica perimeter, delivering, say, growth in line with the group pace. We are at work now on the next steps, expanding the brand footprint both through e-commerce and new stores as well as improving the eyewear category. We are also happy with the Heidelberg addition as it is opening new opportunities in medical applications that are becoming a strategic priority for us.\nDiagnostic and eye treatment as a part of broader strategic focus on eyecare is the natural evolution in med tech space for our group. Talking about revenue, I also like to highlight the amazing performance of Stellest growing 60% in the full year in China and gained traction in Europe. This, once again, proves how urgent it is to address the myopia issue in China, Asia and worldwide, including the U.S. market that we look forward to start serving between this year and the beginning of the next.\nLooking at the group profitability in 2024, we substantially expanded our margins, with adjusted operating margin advancing by 50 basis points, offsetting the labor-driven inflationary pressure on our cost base. We also achieved double-digit net margin and sound free cash flow generation, resulting in the dividend distribution proposed in line with the last year at EUR 3.95 per share, also confirming the scrip dividend option.\nI'd rather like to focus now on the 2 disruptive technological innovation that EssilorLuxottica has been promoting in the market. To make it evolved towards a future where a pair of eyeglasses will be the main digital computing platform, addressing our daily needs related to medical service as well as information and social entertainment. Let's start with the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, a new category of products that we introduced in cooperation with Meta more than 3 years ago and is now proving to be a great success for its digital future, the ramp-up sales and utilization rates.\nSince its launch in September 2023, EssilorLuxottica has sold more than 2 million units of Ray-Ban Meta. The rate of activation and the time of utilization have been constantly increasing since the first launch, showing that this product is becoming part of our daily life. The category of wearable is at an early stage, but we have great confidence in its potential, and we are planning for the long term with Meta. We are thinking about new releases, [ renewed feature ] future and new brands, all supported by a key application in smart glasses and wearable.\nWe expect important progress soon as the most advanced multimodel AI, which is currently available in U.S., Canada and Australia, will expand across other markets worldwide. Consistently with our open model, we look at this product like a shared platform ready to embark on third-party brands and new function also in the form of subscription services. In the light of such evolution and in line with our ambitious plan, we are currently expanding our production capacity for Ray-Ban Meta, set to reach 10 million annual units by the end of next year.\nPassing to hearing aid glasses, we have launched Nuance Audio, both in the U.S. market and the main European countries. In the U.S., we have just got the full clearance from FDA and we are selling Nuance glasses in the OTC segment. In terms of the trade channel strategy, we confirm we'll go through wholesale, physical retail and e-commerce, including both our and third-party partners and hearing aid specialist. Selling and training tools are ready. The whole powerful platform of EssilorLuxottica is ready to push. We are also currently speaking with insurance group to include the hearing aid part of the product in the new managed hearing care schemes like we do in vision correction.\nIn Europe, we have obtained the CE level as well as the ISO quality certification, and we are getting ready to start selling Nuance in Italy, in France, Germany and U.K. In line with the U.S. market, the trade channel mix will encompass both wholesale and retail, including hearing aid retailers and our own optical banners in each country. We strongly believe in our product and its ability to address a currently unserved need for more than 1 billion people worldwide affected by mild to moderate uncorrected hearing impairment.\nThe disruptive comfort of pair of good-looking and well treating glasses, equipped with a groundbreaking open air hearing solution available at an affordable price will overcome the adoption barriers of stigma, discomfort in eye [indiscernible] that have so far prevented the category from rising in penetration. The journey is just the beginning. As we are already at work on the next product releases to offer to our customers higher quality and new functionality already later this year. Thanks to our audio team for their strong effort so far. Let's make it work now altogether. With that, I hand over to Paul.\n\nPaul du Saillant\n\nDeputy CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Francesco, and to all of you for being here today. As you have just heard, our company is in great shape. In the past years, we have never stood still. Instead, we have optimized each and every ingredient of our powerful organization, delivering a high pace of innovation, strengthening our supply chain, adding high-profile brands to our portfolio.\nThanks to the engagement and commitment of our 200,000 colleagues who stand at the core of our strong execution, all this while accelerating the building of new categories. Let me give you an update on some key product and strategic initiatives. First, let's talk about children. Our myopia management initiative is evolving fast. Our first generation Stellest Plano has experienced rapid growth, and we have equipped almost 3 million kids around the globe in 2024.\nBased on clinical evidence, we have recently amplified its medical scope targeting premyopic children with the aim to delay the onset or possibly even prevent myopia altogether. The Stellest Plano version started to be prescribed at the end of last year. Building on its success, we are now looking at the Stellest brand more broadly, creating a full suite of product and solutions. 2 upcoming launches. The Stellest glasses, which feature a frame specifically designed to take into account the facial parameters of children for the best fit and maximize treatment. And the Stellest [indiscernible] contact lenses, which represent the debut of the brand in the U.S.\nIn the meantime, in China, the Nikon and Kodak [ Dot ] lenses with the SightGlass technology have also had a stellar year successfully supporting our myopia management portfolio strategy.\nA word on transitions, a success story. In recent years, the brand managed to effectively rejuvenate its image and is now chosen by million consumers of all age groups as a cool feature to colorfully express their individuality while also protecting their eyes. The growing trend was recently also fueled by the launch of [ Denis ] which is completing its worldwide rollout with Brazil and across Asia.\nNow take Ray-Ban Meta that Francesco talked earlier about. Already, 40% of the pairs sold in our direct-to-consumer channel are equipped with transition. It is the enabler to all day use of the product. And we are taking the brand a step further with new applications. In 2024, we launched the first-of-a-kind Ray-Ban change, featuring the transition technology directly on the frame. The result is a fully dynamic pair of glasses with changing colors on the lens and the frame. Our brand's a strategic asset. They are critical in conveying our innovation and product benefits to the consumer.\nLately, we have enriched our portfolio with new licenses. The newest addition are Moncler, which presented its first stunning line collection at the spectacular event in Crans Montana, mid-January. Diesel whose bold, daring style are destinated to create buzz among GenZ trend setters, while the product license has just been renewed for the next 10 years. A lot more is to come this year also for proprietary brands, Ray-Ban, and in particular, Oakley, which will be celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer. Stay tuned. As you have heard from Francesco, the med tech dimension is a strategic priority for us. On that front, we have recently made decisive moves. Our aim is to serve our customers and patients from a more holistic standpoint, covering all aspects of eye care, including eye disease diagnostics, surgical guidance and management of chronic conditions.\nIn a world with a growing and aging population, the number of people affected by eye pathologies is increasing significantly. At the same time, health care systems across the globe are under pressure and the shortage of doctors is growing. To unburden the system, eye care practices can play an enhanced role in screening and monitoring eye health under the shared care approach. Leveraging our relations with all actors of the industry, we are well positioned to contribute to this challenge. With the highly advanced OCT devices from Heidelberg Engineering and the retinal imaging solution of Cellview, we have added powerful capabilities in the posterior and anterior eye segment for addressing diseases, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract and retinal detachment.\nWhile noninvasive devices of Espansione powered by light therapy will be a game changer in the effective treatment of chronic conditions, such as dry eye. Before concluding, I always like to share with you the remarkable progress we make with our inclusive OneSight EssilorLuxottica Foundation and its programs. Since 2013, we have provided access to Vision Care for almost 1 billion people and equipped close to 90 million individuals with eyeglasses they urgently needed.\nRegarding our sustainability journey, we are happy to share the validation of our targets for Scope 1, 2, 3 by the SBTi and the inclusion of EssilorLuxottica in the Dow Jones best-in-class Europe Index. And now let me hand it over to Stefano, who will run you through how our each offering has been effectively delivered to our customers through our global multichannel go-to-market organization.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Paul, and good evening, everyone. Happy to be with all of you for our 2024 earnings release. We closed another year of outstanding growth in our top line across all the regions and all the segments that delivered positive growth at constant exchange rate. Latin America and Asia Pacific were just below 10%. The EMEA region was approximately 8% growth, and North America posted a 3% growth for the full year 2024. .\nWhen we look at the fourth quarter, I would say that we closed at our best, posting the higher quarter of the year, with revenues up 9.2% at constant currency. And even excluding the impact of the newly acquired Supreme and Heidelberg that are part of the full consolidation in EssilorLuxottica since October 1, we will be looking at the best quarter for 2024 with revenue up 5.6%. So we're clearly very pleased with the way we perform, deliver and executed in 2024.\nA quick touch on currencies, we are financing our current exchange results broadly in line with a constant one, and we saw revenue up 9.2% at constant exchange rate, while our current exchange rate results posted revenue 8.5%. In the month of November and December, we're also seeing that current exchange results actually were better than the constant one, and that's obviously very promising as we enter into 2025.\nBut now if we move across the 4 different regions as usual, we begin with North America that posted a Q4 up 7.8% in acceleration from the third quarter that was 1.6%. This was a remarkable quarter for North America, actually, the best one. And for sure, the impact of Supreme played a role. But even excluding the impact of the acquisition, we will be looking at the best quarter of the year for Professional Solutions, the best quarter of the year for the direct-to-consumer in North America.\nIn our B2B division, the frame part of the business outperformed the lens in Q4. And we had a strong delivery of Ray-Ban in Ray-Ban Meta in Ray-Ban prescription. But we also had a good performance in our premium fashion portfolio with [indiscernible] and in luxury portfolio, in particular with Miu Miu and Chanel. Moving to the lens part of our business. We were positive on both single vision lenses and progressive lenses. We've got a great traction, I would say, from the Shamir progressive lenses. And from a price mix standpoint, we continue to see a strong price mix and that is true in both lenses and frames.\nAnd when we look at our distribution channel in North America, I would say that our growth was very much driven by our key accounts. While on the independent side, we continue to see an outstanding performance of the Vision Source Alliance. And now let me move to the other channel, the direct to consumer. As I mentioned to you before, we had the best quarter in 2024 in Q4. We had a strong rebound in Sunglass Hut North America.\nAnd if you remember, during Q3 we were already observing a step change in Sunglass Hut during the month of September. Now that step change is confirmed. Now we are reporting a fourth quarter in Sunglass Hut with comp sales that are in the high single-digit territory. Both international and no international Sunglass Hut location posted a strong comp and the delivery was very much balanced between price/mix and volume. A quick touch on the optical banners. They deliver a low single-digit comps during the course of a fourth quarter. We had a good quarter in LensCrafters with positive traffic and a successful introduction during the second half of 2024 of the new LensCrafters adaptive progressive lens designed by Samir.\nBut now let's move to the other critical region, Europe, 9.6% at constant currency acceleration compared to the 5.6% that we reported in Q3. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the EMEA region. And out of those 15 quarters of revenue growth, 13 were delivered at either high single-digit or double-digit pace. Let me say that this is a track record that it's probably closer to a fast-growing market, a fast-growing region than a mature one like EMEA supposed to be. Big credit for this outstanding result to the execution that we had across all the distribution channel across the product category and individual markets.\nWhen we look at our 2 distribution channels, both professional solution and direct-to-consumer delivered an outstanding quarter. We were double digit on direct to consumer and high single digit in our Professional Solutions channel. When we look at the countries across the EMEA region, we show widespread positive trend.\nIn Italy, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, we delivered double-digit growth. In the Middle East and Spain, we were in the mid-single digit. And in France, we delivered low single-digit growth. When we look at our professional solution channel, our independents, our key accounts, our e-commerce partner were the 3 main drivers for the growth. But when we look at the product categories, I would say frames posted a high single-digit quarter with strong delivery on both Sun and prescription with Oakley and the luxury portfolio they were all in healthy shape during the quarter, the last quarter of the year.\nWhen we look at our lens business, Eyezen was double digit, Stellest was double digit. Nikon delivered double digit while transition in Varilux delivered a mid-single-digit pace. So the message I want to convey is that we had a very strong, widespread growth in EMEA region on the B2B side. Moving to direct-to-consumer, high single-digit comps in both optical and Sun. Let me start with Optical Retail. That continues the journey of elevation of the consumer experience. And you remember, we talked about that during the Capital Market Day. And every now and then, I'd love to share with you where are we with that journey.\nAnd I will share with you a few examples that give you a good flavor of the work that the team has done recently. The EssilorLuxottica lens penetration today in GrandVision is around 70% of the total assortment. When we look at the frames, the penetration is around 85% in the fourth quarter. Another important aspect is represent -- assets is represented by the subscription business model. 20% of the optical retail business in Q4 is underneath the subscription model. Teleoptometry, another important initiative. 10% of the store base in Optical Retail Europe is leveraging teleoptometry. In 2024, we performed approximately 140,000 eye examination leveraging teleoptometry. Where can we go from there? Well, we have an ambitious goal. By 2027, to equip approximately 3,000 stores and performing a single year 1 million of eye examination leveraging teleoptometry. The last important chapter of this journey is represented by the renovation efforts that we are undertaking.\nAnd we're marching at full speed with over 250 stores that were tasked to renewed in 2024. And also some key flagship locations that maybe some of you have seen walking by the European Street, like, for example, the GrandOptical in IND, the Vision Express in Oxford Street in London or [indiscernible] Frankfurt, they are now performing extremely well after the recent renovation. On the Sun retail banner, I would say, good delivery for the locations that are more exposed to touristic traffic, but also the other ones in EMEA were actually delivering good comp sales, in particular, Turkey and Spain that deliver a double-digit pace; France that was in the high single-digit comps and Italy that delivered mid-single-digit comp sales during the course of Q4.\nBut now let's switch gear, let's move east and let's touch Asia Pacific. 14% top line growth at constant currency, the best quarter of the year in Asia Pacific. Clearly, in this quarter, there is an impact from the acquisition of Supreme. And excluding that impact of M&A, we will be looking at the fourth quarter in a mid-single-digit [ speed ] substantially aligned with the trajectory that we reported during the course of Q3.\nNow let me share a couple of highlights for the region. All the key countries like China, like Southeast Asia, like Japan and Korea recorded a solid growth during the course of Q4. India was probably the only one just slightly negative, due to a soft sell-out that we experienced on the frame part of the business in Q4. In China, myopic controls product categories, continuous journey with a double-digit growth from both Stellest and the Nikon and Kodak lenses that leverage the DLT technology.\nJust to give you an idea, the overall category, of Myopia Solution grew in Q4 in excess of 50% and represents now 25% of the revenue base in the country, outstanding. Excluding the myopia solution category in China, we continue to experience a soft demand as we observed during the course of the third quarter, and we've seen that, in particular, in the Bolon brand. Let's touch on direct-to-consumer. Optical comps are a low single digit with positive in Australia, where our Sunglass Hut banner, Oakley and Ray-Ban stores in the region, they all deliver mid-single-digit comp, I would say, in particular, thanks to a strong double-digit comp in the Japan country.\nNow let's move to the last country, last region in our journey here, and that is Latin America, 8.7% at constant currency. In Latin America, this is clearly another strong quarter for the region represents the 16th consecutive quarter of positive growth at constant currency. When we look at our B2B side, the professional solution we, delivered low single digit on top of the strongest quarter last year, where I remind you, we grew 17% versus 2022. So a very, I would say, tough comparison base for professional solution.\nOn the other side, our direct-to-consumer was up 15%, delivering the strongest quarter of the year. On the B2B side, we have the Brazil part of a business that was negative, but very much driven by that tough comparison base that I touched upon before. And it was particularly true on the land side of the business, while the frame business were actually strong in Q4, in particular in the luxury segment.\nNow we are a few days into 2025. And I can already anticipate that as we enter in Q1, we do have an expectation of a step change in our Brazilian performance in Q1. For the rest of Latin America, we delivered double-digit quarter, helped by inflationary impact of Argentina, but also by a strong double-digit pace in Colombia, where we experienced a successful launch of Transition GenS.\nNow we're finishing with Professional Solutions, let's move to the direct-to-consumer side. In Q4, like in Q3, we had another double-digit quarter for our direct to consumer distribution channel. Our optical retail banner were on fire. [ JV ] banners in Mexico, the one in Andes, Optical Center in Guatemala, the [indiscernible] directly operated stores, all delivered double-digit quarter. Last touch on our Sun banners that on the largest Sunglass Hut footprint in the region, that is the Mexican one, delivered a double-digit comp. So very compelling picture on both optical and Sun for the LatAm region.\nAnd let's now move to the profit and loss. I would say we are very pleased by the way we closed 2024, in particular, during the second half of the year, where the currency headwinds were materially reduced compared to the one that we faced in 2023 and in the first part of 2024. As usual, consistently with our narrative in the past, I will comment and focus more on constant currency results. I won't touch top line as we already covered that before, and I will start with our gross margin.\nOur gross margin in 2024 expanded 30 basis points at constant currency, with an expansion that is slightly lower in H2 compared to H1, and that was very much due to a strong performance of Ray-Ban Meta during the latter part of 2024. And as you know, Ray-Ban Meta is dilutive, and that dilution though, was largely offset by the favorable impact of price mix at group level. When we look at our operating expenses, they decreased approximately 20 basis points still at constant currency. And here, you can appreciate our effort to continue to balance on one side, a strong control on our cost base and on the other side, continue to fuel the pipeline of our strategic investment, for example, Ray-Ban Meta, the evolution and the expansion of the wearable family, the investment to launch nuance and the major strategic initiative of artificial intelligence and diagnostic.\nAll in all, our operating profit expanded 50 basis points on a full year basis, which represent the promised margin accretion compared to the one that we post for the full year 2023. When we look at our results at current exchange rate, you're looking at 20 basis points margin expansion at the operating profit level with an H2 margin expansion that was 40 basis points. Now if we go down for a second to the group net profit, our margin were 40 basis points accretive at constant currency with a tax rate that was broadly in line with 2023 and an increase in our financial cost that was mainly related to the application of the IFRS 16 lease accounting principle and a slightly higher instrument expense on our financial debt.\nAll in all, our group net profit expanded 20 basis points at current exchange at 11.8%. And now the last chapter of this journey, free cash flow and net debt. Our free cash flow generation was once again extremely strong, EUR 2.4 billion for the full year 2024, slightly higher than the one that we recorded in 2023 with the capital expenditures that are substantially flat year-over-year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 2 at 1.7 and clearly include the impact of the recently acquired Heidelberg Engineering and Supreme.

Earnings Call\n\nELNYSEMAY 1, 9:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, everyone, and welcome to the Estée Lauder Company's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast.\n[Operator Instructions]\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nHello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our results today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release.\nUnless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, reference to online sales include sales that we make directly to our consumers, through our brand .com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\n\nFabrizio Freda\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to review our third quarter results and discuss our strategic initiatives. For the third quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 6% at the high end of our outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to significantly improve working capital. We achieved stronger-than-anticipated performance beginning with gross margin. Results benefited from a greater than expected mix of skin care. Moreover, we made great strides in reducing the pressure on excess and obsolescence, driven by our now lower inventory levels and in realizing strategic pricing. Further contributing to the outperformance, we manage expenses with discipline across multiple areas of the business and have shifted certain advertising spending to the fourth quarter to support our rich innovation pipeline and expanded consumer reach.\nEncouragingly, with our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, we are confident that the second half of fiscal year 2024 will indeed prove to be an inflection point for the company, representing a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. First, momentum in organic sales growth is primed to accelerate in the fourth quarter for a strong second half. Second, we continue to expect operating margin in the second half of fiscal year 2024 to be higher than the first half and to expand from the year ago period.\nThird, with a profit recovery plan designed to deliver $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, we are well positioned to rebuild our profitability. And with the profit recovery plan also expected to generate savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are well positioned to accelerate sustainable sales and profit growth as a faster and leaner organization with stronger leverage from our future growth. During the third quarter, we accomplished much to solidify the inflection point of the second half.\nIndeed, we made progress in achieving targeted trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail. We are encouraged by the evolution of our Asia travel retail business this fiscal year as we execute our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and effort by various local authorities to contain a structured market activity. And retail sales growth in Asia travel retail significantly improved sequentially, returning to growth in the third quarter. This improving retail sales trend near travel retail complemented double-digit retail sales growth we continue to see in EMEA and the Americas travel retail. So far this fiscal year, we also invested in the long-term growth opportunities of traveling consumers, evidenced by our brands having moved within Hainan Sanya International Duty 3 shopping complex, to the Galleria's new Global Beauty Plaza.\nThe larger elegant new stores expands upon the high-touch services and experiences that we offered at the previous locations in the complex from Estée Lauder [indiscernible] new Skin Longevity Institute to La Mer cabin offering bespoke Spa services and Kilian Paris Juice and coated bar featuring fragrance inspire copters. We also made great progress in advancing strategic initiatives and launching exciting innovation to fuel North America, reaccelerate growth in Mainland China and drive momentum in markets that are strong across developed and emerging markets in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America.\nLet me begin with clinic where we had a robust quarter of progress as the brands double down on its authentic dermatologists brand heritage. Clinique deepened its relationship with the medical community, returning to the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting with high impact engagements. The brand also established the Clinique dermatologist Creator Council, a collection of doctors who are amplifying the sharing of science and dermatological insights on their own social channels as well as informing Clinique narrative on its social platforms. Impressively, Clinique influence earned media value for skin care in the U.S. showed 80% during the quarter, leaping 33 spots in rank.\nWe believe this is just the beginning of the success Clinique will realized by communicating its dermatological education and clinically proven solution for skin care to make up. Moreover, having started with Clinique in March, we are thrilled to be strategically expanding our consumer reach in the U.S. as a select few brands will open dedicated storefronts in Amazon's fast-growing premium beauty store over the coming months. Clinique's launched capitalized on its renewed dermatologists guided branding with striking creative assets and elevated storytelling. Impressively, Clinique store has exceeded our retail sales expectations so far and already contributed in March to the brand's share gains in U.S. prestige skin care biggest subcategory of moisturizers among others, as well as in U.S. prestige makeup. We also successfully accelerated our innovation in the quarter. For the Estée Lauder brand, we brought to market breakthrough innovation across franchises. For its luxury renewed franchise, the brand was inspired by its over 15 years of skin longevity research with its new Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliance of cream and serum cream foundation. The impact of these launches is powerful, beyond contributing to the brand growth, they firmly established [indiscernible] as a leader in the science of skin longevity, a visible age reversal.\nFor Estée Lauder Supreme franchise, the brand leveraged its decades of [indiscernible] repair expertise in collagen research with the new revitalizing Supreme night bounce stream first launched to rave reviews in Asia Pacific and expanding globally in the coming months. We believe this launch holds great promise serving to strengthen the brand leadership in nighttime science and skin care across subcategories.\nLa Mer extended its winning streak of innovation with the most rising fresh cream, which along with its Icon Hero products drove the brand to be the strongest contribution to the company growth for the quarter. Beyond these strategic innovations and go-to-market activations across active derma, longevity, nat skin care, M·A·C introduced newness in makeup to jump start our rich innovation pipeline in the category for the second half. M·A·C launched maximal silk [indiscernible] lipstick to greater claim, successfully modernizing its Icon M·A·C lipstick with nourishing ingredients and bolder packaging. From sell to Berlin to New York City events, maximal pop up events drove strong engagement and earned media value. M·A·C remastered studio fixed fluid foundation came to market in April delivering a new soft map finish enhanced with new skincare ingredients at even more shades. This high sought innovation and its icon prove the enduring love of M·A·C consumers and the capacities alike as the brand celebrates its 40 years in 2024.\nLooking at fragrances. Over the last couple of months, we have expanded our consumer reach in the high-potential Asia Pacific region, opening spectacular flagship stores for Jo Malone London and [indiscernible] each unique with locally relevant features. And we are incredibly excited for the evolution in luxury and artisanal sciences as together with [indiscernible] we introduced Valmond Beauty this September. Across our brands and around the world, we are focused on leveraging technology, including AI in support of our enduring strengths and high-touch experiences and high-quality products. We continue to partner with leading technology companies from Microsoft with whom we are collaborating to embed AI to drive faster speed to market and local relevance to Google Cloud as we strive to enhance customized targeting of media at scale.\nTurning to the regions. We have spoken about our focus on driving the momentum in markets which are strong. To that end, we have delivered terrific results across many markets, reflecting the desirability of our brands, a compelling innovation, which I described and strong go-to-market execution. We see this across our developed and emerging markets around the world. Beginning in Asia Pacific, Hong Kong, [indiscernible], Japan have prospered, up double-digit organically in the quarter and year-to-date and we are excited about what's to come, including the launch of the ordinary in Japan during the fourth quarter.\nMoving to EMEA. Germany and Italy have consistently contributed to growth in the markets of the region each quarter. Mexico, Brazil and India strong double-digit growth in the third quarter, fueled excellent performance in our emerging markets year-to-date. For North America, we delivered sequentially improved organic sales trends in the third quarter driven by the multi-facet strategic plan we first discussed with you in August. We are pleased with the results we are seeing in our areas of strategic focus.\nSkin Care grew organically in North America for the third consecutive quarter driven by Estée Lauder and the ordinary Health Hero products, innovation and go-to-market activation excelled. Our luxury and [indiscernible] fragrances rose double digits organically one more fueled by Jo Malone London, Kilian Paris and Ton forth. Across our brand portfolio in North America, we are realizing success as we focus on deepening consumer engagement on social platforms where so much discovery in beauty take place. The Ordinary has long been a pioneer with an outstanding social engine and more of our brands have enhanced their engagement with consumers this year. We are also successfully expanding our consumer reach to better serve new consumers from Clinique's new storefront in the U.S. Amazon Premium Beauty store to expansions early this fiscal year as the Estée Lauder brand entered into more Ultra Beauty stores and Killian Paris entered into additional Sephora stores. For Clinique as the #1 dermatology beauty brand in the U.S. Prestige, we are optimistic for the positive impact is launched on the U.S. Amazon Premium Beauty store will have for the fourth quarter in the initial performance in March.\nFor Mainland China, we returned to organic sales growth, albeit at a slower pace than expected amid an overall soft prestige beauty industry. Retail sales for prestige beauty were strong in January, but moderated in February and March, due in part to the Chinese New Year [indiscernible] with Valentine Day this year, which limited gifts. This certainly impacted the industry but also many of our brands, which have a strong presence in gifting.\nOur focus remains bringing irresistible newness to consumers to best create growth opportunities. Here, our innovation in Estée Lauder [indiscernible] and Supreme franchise as well as a La Mer and M·A·C were well received across the third quarter, and we have more compelling launches in the fourth quarter, one in particular from Estée Lauder Perfectionist Pro franchise is especially exciting as it is among the first product created in our China innovation labs and addresses local demand for SPS 50 plus UV protection that is suitable for sensitive and post [indiscernible] procedures of the skin. With a 4 quarter innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation launch throughout the third quarter, and the key shopping moments of [ 618 ] are coming, we are increasing our investment in advertising, a go-to-market activation to sustain retail. Since we spoke with you in February, we also made important progress in all work streams across the pillar of the profit recovery plan, of which I'm pleased to share a few examples with you today. For one, our integrated business planning process, which has now rolled out globally, is contributing to operational inventory improvements. Our enterprise-wide integrated business planning will serve as the foundation to drive better demand planning and reduce excess enable obsolescence.\nIt is complemented by advanced planning technologies, including AI, to statistically elevate forecast accuracy, a dynamically positioned and deploy inventories. We have refined and optimized our innovation pipeline for fiscal year 2025 and '26 to best focus on accretive innovation, bringing to market products that both creates and drive trends locally and globally across categories. Innovation in fiscal year 2025 is still expected to be even bigger and stronger than in fiscal year 2024 with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into white space opportunities.\nWe also announced plans to streamline manufacturing and distribution on a campus through realigning ship schedules, consolidating operations into fewer buildings and shifting [indiscernible] manufacture it to a trusted third-party partners. This strategic initiative accomplished multiple objectives. As in addition to consolidating capacity and optimizing costs, we also expect greater speed to market by leveraging more external innovation with a global leader in power.\nBefore I close, I want to speak to the exciting milestones in our brand portfolio during the fourth quarter. First, a few days ago marked the 1-year anniversary of our Tom Ford acquisition, this transformational deal where we evolved from licensees of Tom Ford Beauty to the owner and licensor of Tom Ford solidified a coveted brand in the company luxury portfolio for the long term and created a new royalty revenue stream. Moreover, it afforded us strategic synergies which we are now unlocking demonstrated by the recent launch of brand.com in the U.S. and U.K. as just 1 example. And with the [indiscernible] Group and Marcolin, we are capitalizing on the power of the brand modern luxury glimmer across fashion, aware and beauty, connecting these 3 verticals in compelling new ways to drive growth. Indeed, in February for Fashion Weeks from Milan to London, Paris and New York, we orchestrated the first-ever 360-degree cross-category contain and secured blockbuster fragrance launch. Later this month, we are thrilled to be further solidifying our brand portfolio in yet another way as we acquired the remaining interest in as completing the deal we made 3 years ago when we became a majority owner. During these 3 years, [indiscernible] and its beloved brands, The Ordinary [indiscernible] to new heights, ranking top 5 in prestige skin care in many markets, including top 2 in its home markets of Canada and the U.S. Together, we have successfully invested to scale innovation for The Ordinary and have increased the ordinary innovation as a percentage of sales from 5% to over 25% expected this fiscal year, expanded the brand globally from India to the Middle East to South Africa and improved its profitability by driving operational efficiencies in the supply chain.\nWith that said, we believe The Ordinary and [indiscernible] still have bigger opportunities in front of them, and we are excited for what the future holds. Finally, we are pleased to see our initiatives and progress in sustainability recognized. And since we spoke with you in February, we were included in the CDP's Climate A list for 2023. Overall, we received our best-ever collective scores in 2023 from CDP as along with these excellent climate results, we scored A- in each of the water security, forest timbers and forest palm oil. In closing, we are at an inflection point in our company performance, primed for a strong second half of organic sales growth and improved profitability. And with our profit recovery plan, we are well positioned to meaningful rebuild our profitability in fiscal year 2025 and '26 while also generating savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives.\nWe are confident in our strategy to realize the promising growth opportunities of global prestige beauty, leveraging the strengths of our diversified brand portfolio rich innovation pipeline and the superior quality of our products. I extend my gratitude to our employees for the significant contribution you have made in bringing us to this inflection point of a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory.\nI will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone.\nOur third quarter organic net sales increased 6% at the higher end of our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we've made thus far in Asia travel retail with reducing retailer inventory and the corresponding return to net sales growth. These achievements in the quarter were a bit earlier than expected and led to a partial shift in the expected timing of the resumption of replenishment orders from the fourth quarter to the third. Partially offsetting this growth was lower-than-expected net sales in Mainland China, reflecting the impact of ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, in part due to subdued consumer confidence and softness during holiday and key shopping moments.\nOur earnings per share of $0.97 exceeded our outlook for the quarter due to the acceleration of skin care, the return to net sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, tighter expense management and a lower tax rate. The reduction in our tax rate was largely driven by the shift in our geographical mix of business. Regarding our regions, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 12% driven largely by the growth in our Travel Retail business.\nOur Travel Retail net sales increased strong double digits returning to growth after 7 consecutive quarters of decline, given the sequential acceleration of retail sales and shipments as well as the anniversary of lower shipments last year, which were pressured by transitory headwinds in Hainan in Korea as well as limited international flights, visas and group tours from China to other markets last year.\nElsewhere in EMEA, organic net sales in our priority emerging markets increased strong double digits where we drove growth from most brands and in most channels of distribution, given our strategic initiative to expand consumer reach, in particular, for our fragrance and skincare brands. Our results in mature markets were mixed, resulting in overall flat growth. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% led by Hong Kong SAR, Mainland China and Japan, reflecting mid-single-digit net sales growth in skin care and high single-digit growth in fragrance. Organic net sales in the Americas increased 1% largely due to Latin America, where continued growth in Mexico and Brazil led by makeup, drove double-digit increases in department stores and freestanding stores.\nOrganic net sales in North America were flat in the quarter as growth in fragrance and skin care was offset by declines in makeup and hair care. The double-digit growth in specialty multi, driven by Estée Lauder and M·A·C was offset by softer performance in department stores and direct-to-consumer channels.\nFrom a category standpoint, organic net sales in skin care rose 9% largely driven by our Asia travel retail business as well as from Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Organic net sales from La Mer and Estée Lauder propelled the category's growth led by strong campaigns behind our Hero product franchises with new product innovation and increased in-store activations. Organic net sales in makeup increased 4% largely driven by our Asia travel retail business and by Latin America. Net sales from Estée Lauder and Clinique led the category's growth fueled by ongoing activations behind our hero product franchises. This was partially offset by a prior year benefit from changes made to M·A·C's take-back loyalty program. Excluding the impact from the prior year benefit, M·A·C net sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all regions, mainly driven by new product innovation.\nOrganic net sales in fragrance increased 1% and in Hair care declined 4%. In Fragrance, net sales growth was driven by our luxury and artisanal brands led by Jo Malone London and [indiscernible]. Jo Malone London grew double digits in Travel Retail and specialty multi. Lualaba saw double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer channels, particularly in freestanding stores, driven by both same-door growth and targeted expanded consumer reach. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline from Estée Lauder due to retail softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our gross margin increased 280 basis points compared to last year. This reflects positive impacts from changes in category mix driven by the acceleration of skin care, lower obsolescence charges given the reduction in excess inventory compared to last year and stronger strategic price realization through lower levels of promotion.\nThese improvements were partially offset as expected by the impact of the previous pull down of production that triggered a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs in the current period instead of when products are sold. This resulted in a 215 basis point headwind to gross margin. Foreign currency also pressured gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses decreased 290 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter, driven by the sales growth leverage and expense management, including advertising and promotional expense, which decreased approximately 240 basis points compared to last year.\nThis reduction reflects the anticipated shift in certain spending from the third quarter to the fourth to support innovation launches in key holiday moments in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 75% to $554 million, and our operating margin expanded 570 basis points to 14.1% compared to 8.4% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5% compared to the elevated rate of 43.1% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations, due to the difference in timing of the estimated change in our full year geographical mix of earnings in the current and prior year periods. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation.\nDiluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.47 last year, largely due to the increase in sales, improvement in gross profit margin and a lower tax rate. The impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.01 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay royalties on the beauty business.\nFor the 9 months, we generated $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1 billion last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital, which was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce in-house inventory levels, primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell.\nWe invested $702 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $710 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. As Fabrizio mentioned, our plans under the profit recovery plan are progressing and are on track. This quarter, we began taking charges under the restructuring program and expect approval to accelerate in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout fiscal 2025 with meaningful benefits beginning to flow into our fiscal year 2025 results.\nTurning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are pleased with our progress thus far in reducing inventory levels resuming replenishment shipments in Asia travel retail, accelerating innovation and selectively expanding our consumer reach. These efforts have led to sequential improvements in both net sales and operating margin from the first half of the year, culminating in our return to profitable net sales growth this quarter. With these results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a stronger second half compared to last year, underscoring that we believe we are at a sales and profitability inflection point.\nWhile we delivered on the high end of our third quarter expectations, we are lowering our fiscal '24 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility, including continued softness in Mainland China and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. In Asia Travel Retail, we are also mindful of potential short-term volatility in retail sales related to actions certain retailers are taking to increase their profitability. With the recalibration between our third and fourth quarters, we discussed earlier, we are maintaining our full year operating margin expectation and are increasing our EPS outlook slightly to reflect disciplined expense management year-to-date, somewhat offset by our plans to strategically invest in key areas of our business in the fourth quarter to continue to drive profitable growth and reflecting incremental headwinds from foreign currency translation.\nThe combination of our third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter results in a strong second half compared to the first half with improvements in net sales and operating margin. Excluding the in-period charge we recognized in the third quarter, gross margin is also expected to improve in the second half. We believe our assumptions for the second half mark a meaningful turning point for the company, demonstrating the signs of our recovery and better position us along with our profit recovery plan initiatives to drive sales growth and profitability further in fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nUsing March 29 spot rates of 1.079 for the euro, 1.262 for the pound, 7.227 for the Chinese yuan and [ 1.350 ] for the Korean yuan, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We now expect organic net sales for our fourth quarter to increase 6% to 10% with increased consumer-facing investments, including shifts from the third quarter and aligned to support innovation in key shopping moments in the fourth quarter. This growth also reflects the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year, primarily in Hainan.\nIn Mainland China, we expect the ongoing softness of overall prestige beauty to continue to pressure net sales. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 1 point. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.18 to $0.28, an increase of over 100%. Currency translation is expected to dilute EPS by $0.01 and potential risks of business disruptions in the Middle East are expected to be dilutive by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between $0.19 to $0.29.\nFor the full year, we expect organic net sales to range between a 1% to 2% decline. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 1 point. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year.\nWe continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.14 and $2.24 before restructuring and other charges. Currency translation and potential risks of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.09 and $0.06, respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decrease between 33% to 36%.\nOur fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes the purchase of the remaining outstanding equity interest in [indiscernible] anticipated to be completed in May of 2024. In closing, our expected second half results starting with our strong third quarter performance demonstrate our progressive return to sales growth and profitability. We have navigated through numerous challenges over this past year with resilience and determination to take meaningful actions to begin to improve the trajectory of our business.\nOur results show we have made great strides, and we have immense gratitude for the resolve and hard work of our teams globally. And while we are pleased with our progress and results this quarter, we remain keenly aware of the additional work that lies ahead to continue down the path of restoring stronger profit margins. We are intensely focused on doing the necessary work to return to long-term sustainable growth and profitability, supported by the profit recovery plan initiatives and executed by our dedicated employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

This is Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. Thank you for joining EssilorLuxottica H1 2024 Results Management Call. The Group's Chairman and CEO, Francesco Milleri, the Deputy CEO, Paul du Saillant; and the CFO, Stefano Grassi will walk you through the business and financial highlights for the period. After their presentations, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I hand it over to Francesco.\n\nFrancesco Milleri\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nWelcome, everybody. Good to see so many of you connected today for the EssilorLuxottica First Semester Earnings Call. I'm pleased to introduce our sound financial performance and give you an update on our key strategic initiatives. In the first 6 months of the year, we posted revenue growth in line with the long-term targets with the 2 quarter well aligned in their performance and the operating margin in sound progression. That leaves us fully confident to deliver on our 5-year targets. Stefano will elaborate on that.\nI just like to emphasize here the solidity of our growth path since 2021 on both revenue and margins always translating into strong cash flows.\nWhile we [ will ] execute our strategy in the core business of eye care and eyewear, we play the role of a front runner in the technological revolution of the industry. The combination of Essilor, Luxottica and GrandVision into one single stronger group was just the first step. Now we are at work to make a second much bolder move, bringing our group into the promising future of wearable and AI-based [ face ] computing. We'll bring together digital platform, portfolio of new applications ranging from eye care, hearing aid, predictive advanced diagnostic to gaming, sports and entertainment. In that direction, Ray-Ban Meta continues to be a great success, upgrading product quality, adding new functionalities and accelerating growth sales. At the start of its journey, Ray-Ban Meta already sold more the Ray-Ban Stories in its entire life.\nWe strongly believe we are just at the beginning of a revolution, which will combine technology with design and branding and deeply reshape many industries converging on our wearable unique platform.\nOne of the key engine of such a revolution is our long-term partnership with Meta, making our proposition in new generation of eyewear more and more powerful. Nuance Audio is part of the same vision. Over the past year, we have made significant progress in developing the new technology, fine-tuning the product and collecting supportive clinical evidence from extensive research and top [ quality ] tests. We continue to present the product to end user and potential customer, gathering a great deal of interest. At the launch, we will be ready with presentation tools [ and ] store product corners to support the sales of Nuance Audio in third-party optical and audiological location together with our own stores.\nBased on the high potential of our product, we have decided to proceed with the submission with the FDA in order to ensure that our product meets the highest standard of safety and efficacy. Being fully respectful of FDA procedure, we still target the end of the year for the launch of Nuance Audio in the U.S. market.\nThe 2 acquisitions we announced last week, the leading diagnostic med tech platform, Heidelberg Engineering from Germany, and the iconic Supreme brand from the U.S. coast are fully in line with our strategy, as they respectively bring to EssilorLuxottica strong capabilities in the ophthalmic applications and one of the most iconic brands among the youth.\nStarting from Heidelberg Engineering, on which Paul will elaborate further, I want to highlight that the German group founded in 1990, is a leading innovator in [ eye, hand ] diagnostic imaging and health care IT solutions for ophthalmology with a unique portfolio of patents and applications into EssilorLuxottica's ecosystem, including HELIX, new digital division, Heidelberg will bring opportunity in different areas like R&D, optometry, health care, IT, big data and AI.\nAs for Supreme. Started in 1994 in New York City, that is really a leading iconic brand, the most authentic and desired brand for the new generations fully direct to consumer, with [ an aura ] of exclusivity and scarcity around its product offering, [ offer ] release and limited units. Such a community is loyal to the brand thus offering EssilorLuxottica and access to an audience that is untapped by its current brand portfolio.\nWell beyond the strong position in apparel, we are acquiring a unique communication platform to address young consumer, nice retail point offering a superior in-store experience are part of such identity. Supreme directly operates 17 well-performing stores in big city worldwide with a strong penetration in China and the other Asian markets. In a much more fluid landscape with different business in the industry converging and mixing each other, brands will matter even more than ever. We see brands as the necessary support for the diffusion of innovations in wearable and digital platform, the necessary culture vehicle to push our disruptive view of the future. Last but not least, Supreme acquisition will be accretive on our margin.\nWith that, I hand over to Paul. Thank you.\n\nPaul du Saillant\n\nDeputy CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Francesco, and good morning, good evening to you all. It's a pleasure like always to be here with you. Today, as you have heard, we are presenting solid first half results. We are very thankful to all our colleagues for the hard work they have put into delivering them.\nBefore digging a little bit deeper into the acquisition of Heidelberg Engineering, I would like to emphasize 3 messages. First, our core activity is in strong shape. In a context, [ that is complex ], our teams are deeply focused on the execution of our strategic priorities. In the last month, we have consolidated our organization, developing our leaders and preparing the generation of tomorrow at all levels. Our flat and agile structure is [ onshoring ] the entrepreneurial spirit of our company.\nSecond, our innovation dynamism remains unparalleled. Just think about how rich our pipeline has been in recent times. And the tangible impact it has already made to our growth, Stellest, Varilux XR, Transition Gen S, Ray-Ban Meta, Ray-Ban Change, the new licenses, Swarovski, Jimmy Chou, Brunello Cucinelli, Perry, Moncler and [indiscernible].\nIt is truly inspiring. We have talked about them already during our last call. So today, I would like to just touch upon 2 of our iconic brands and categories, Stellest, and Oakley. We have recently released our 5-year clinical trial findings for Stellest at the ARVO Annual Meeting in Seattle. The data shows that the lenses are effective in slowing down the myopia progression and [ axel ] elongation saving 1.75 D on average over 5 years. The confirmation of the strong results over an extended time horizon really proves how impactful our technology is. More than one million children have been equipped with Stellest in the first half.\nA lot is going on at Oakley. And on top, they are preparing for the olympics starting tomorrow in Paris. The brand is buzzing with excitement for this huge sporting event, and we are a [indiscernible] at the [ Paris ] [indiscernible] to host its team Oakley athletes. Oakley will be outfitting the U.S. surfing team with a super cool collection of functional offshore apparel and eyewear. The brand has also just dropped the new special [ Enos Park ] frame collection, drawing attention to the deep emotions that athletes go through when competing. Check it out.\nThird, we are preparing for the future in a bold way. With industry transforming initiatives, as we have heard from Francesco, and a clear focus on sustainability where we are advancing well on our agenda with concrete actions. We have just announced that by 2025, we will create a 25 hectares solar farm close to our Italian Barberini manufacturing site, able to produce approximately 30,000 megawatt of the renewable energy per year, an equivalent of the annual electricity consumption of approximately 10,000 families. And we have recently submitted our near-term emission reduction targets to the SBTi for approval. Our initiatives so far have led to an improvement in major sustainability rankings, such as SCI, ESG, Sustainanalytics and Moody's.\nNow I would like to focus on Heidelberg Engineering. This is clearly a leap forward in stepping up the capabilities of EssilorLuxottica in the med tech space, through building a complete spectrum of eye care solutions from routine exam to advanced diagnostics, combined with AI capabilities. With Heidelberg Engineering and their teams, we are bringing great expertise, [ cutting ] edge technology and a globally renowned brand into the EssilorLuxottica family. Their advanced solution in the field of diagnostic imaging, digital surgical microscopes and health care IT solutions empower ophthalmologists to detect, diagnose and monitor eye disease at an early stage.\nTheir, SPECTRALIS device is widely recognized as the gold standard in ophthalmic imaging and has also been chosen by the NASA to monitor the vision of astronauts above the ISS. Heidelberg Engineering is known for its powerful R&D capabilities and contribution to sight-saving scientific research. They are also actively integrating small and innovative companies to foster the development of new projects, values that are very much aligned with the one of our company. With this move, we enter the space of clinical ophthalmology, which will allow us to upgrade our offering and expand our scientific programs.\nAnd now I will hand it over to Stefano who will ran you through the financial performance. Thank you.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Paul, and welcome to our first half earnings release. As usual, we start our journey on the financial, commenting first our revenue results and then I'll move to the P&L and the free cash flow generation.\nDuring the course of the second quarter, EssilorLuxottica delivered a top line up 5.2% at constant currency. [ A cruise speed ] that is very much aligned with our long-term guidance. Despite the environment, we are surrounded is uncertain, in particular, in our main market, the U.S. one. When we look at our growth at current exchange rate, where top line was up 3.8%. So the gap between constant and current exchange result is narrowing during the course of second quarter, and I would say it's mainly driven by some minor [ currencies ].\nBoth Professional Solutions and Direct to Consumer deliver a mid-single-digit quarter, posting a solid growth pretty much in every region. That's always a pretty important priority for us, making sure that our delivery is pretty balanced across the geographies and within each geography across the 2 distribution channel. But now as usual, let me walk through the first geography in [ pie ], and that is North America that posted during the course of the second quarter, the top line up 1.4%. I would say both division, Professional Solutions and Direct to Consumer delivered a low single-digit quarter.\nIn the B2B division, we experienced a deceleration [ in dependent ] channel with a pretty polarized picture. On one side, we have our ECP that are not part of our strategic partnerships that were negative in the second quarter in a market that was still very competitive, still very price sensitive, especially on the lower price points. While our strategic alliances, and I would probably mention here, Vision Source grew on a high single-digit territory.\nIf we look at the other channel now, the key accounts were in the positive territory during the course of Q2. Our e-commerce partner [ or ] department stores that both performed well with a double-digit delivery.\nMoving to price/mix. Well, price/mix during Q2 was the primary driver of our growth on the lens business, especially thanks to Varilux, Eyezen and Shamir. While for the frame side, we see a more balanced growth between volume and price mix with double digit in Ray-Ban Meta that very much supported the growth of Ray-Ban brand. On the licensing side, I would probably mention a good start for the first half of the year of our Swarovski license in North America.\nAnd now let's give a quick touch on direct-to-consumer. Our optical retail banner delivered another solid quarter. LensCrafters, Target Optical, they were in low single-digit comps while Pearle Vision delivered a mid-single-digit comp during the course of the second quarter, proving once again the resilience of our optical retail business in North America.\nI will make a last touch now on retail sun that deliver a low single-digit negative comps. Here, let me say we have no indication of a materially different trend between what we've seen in Q2 and the previous quarters. If I look at my glass half full for a second, I can tell you that the Sunglass Hut locations, the one that we're more exposed to touristic traffic actually performed well with comps on the positive territory during the course of Q2.\nBut now let's switch gears. Let's move to EMEA. EMEA that delivered an outstanding quarter, I would say, another outstanding quarter. 7.9% top line growth in the second quarter, the 13th consecutive quarter of top line growth in the EMEA region. And we really, for the EMEA, there are 3 areas on which I would focus. First of all, our B2B business that continues to be strong quarter after quarter in both lenses and frames. In all the main geographies, we saw solid growth in France, in Italy, in Spain, in the U.K., in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, in South Africa and Middle East, and I'm sorry for a long number of countries. But just to give you an idea of how strong was our delivery in the region.\nLenses business were positive, thanks to our branded lens portfolio with Varilux, with Stellest, with Eyezen, they all perform at double-digit pace. And on the frame side, we delivered double-digit growth on the Oakley brand. But now with the upcoming Olympics game in Paris, we'll get more and more visibility, thanks to our athletes that are going to compete every day to win the gold medal.\nThe second important pillar is our optical retail business that delivered double-digit growth with high speed in synergy realization in both lenses and frames assortment, with a deeper penetration of the subscription model that is now running in 18 countries in Europe and represents 1/3 of the growth of optical retail in the region. With the [ teletometry ] that is also now available in over 350 stores and with the celebration of 2 successful flagship stores like the [indiscernible] 1 on Grand Optical that some of you visited at the end of May and the other one in [ Oxford Street ] for Vision Express that had a lot of visibility in the news.\nThe third important pillar is our sun retail business. Here, we suffer lack of good weather in Europe. And I would say that, that was particularly true in the peak month like June, where we will normally generate 40% of the revenue of the quarter. Anyway, [ our sun ] during the course of the second quarter, was just a touch below mid-single digit with positive delivery in Italy and Spain. And in my view, this performance proves once again the strength of our Sunglass Hut business model outside the U.S.\nNow the third region, moving to East is Asia Pacific, a strong quarter, the best performing growth in the 3 -- of the 4 regions and 9.8% at constant currency. This delivery comes on top of the best quarter for Asia Pacific in 2023, where I remind you, our top line grew 24% at constant currency. In the region, Mainland China and Japan delivered a double-digit growth. All the other key countries were under positive territory. Stellest, I usually talk about it every time because I think it's an outstanding and impressive story of growth, grew in excess of 80%, but also Varilux and Eyezen started to deliver solid growth with a double-digit pace. On the frames side, I would probably mention here, again, Oakley. Oakley is gaining more visibility with the Chinese consumer. Oakley is gaining more awareness, and I think this is obviously very important and very rewarding for us and for the brand.\nIf we move for a second now to the Direct to Consumer, I mentioned mid-single-digit comps in OPSM, where we're observing an improved conversion, a better price mix. While on the other side, [ in Hong Kong ], our retail business continues to struggle as we experienced soft comps throughout the quarter, and that is very much due to a lower touristic traffic in the city.\nNow the last region in the pipeline is Latin America, 8.6% top line growth at constant currency. I would say, in the top line, we have a material help coming from the inflationary impact of Argentina. We also need to mention that the largest country in the region, Brazil suffered between the end of April and the month of May, the dramatic consequence of the floating in the region called Rio do Sul. You probably -- many of you have seen the terrible picture of the situation in that region. We had about 1,800 doors that we serve as a client on the B2B side that were impacted. We have slightly less than 100 stores between corporate-owned stores and franchising stores that were impacted, and we're now every day working next to our clients with our store to resume their day-to-day operations.\nDespite that, the performance in Brazil were slightly positive with the B2B frames that were at double-digit pace, and while on the other side, the Direct to Consumer, we had double-digit comp in sun as well as in [indiscernible]. So overall, a pretty compelling picture for Brazil despite the major challenge in a specific region in the southern part of the country.\nIf we move now for a second to the Direct to Consumer in the Hispanic LatAm region, I would like, once again, strong delivery of the formerly known GrandVision banner, in particular, the one that are Nicaragua, in Costa Rica, in Andes, in Mexico and Honduras, they all posted solid growth, and that was very much driven by price mix, thanks to a strategic realistic view of the assortment in the region for both lenses and frames that is obviously paying back.\nWe closed out the journey across the 4 different regions, and now let's face and introduce a new chapter. That is the profit and loss. And moving to the profit and loss, as usual, I will focus more on the constant currency results. Our gross margin, as you can see, is 40 basis points accretive compared to 2023. That's obviously a very pleasing result for our P&L. It's very much the result of a stronger mix effect and couple that with the price increase that we executed throughout the year, throughout the beginning of 2024 in both lenses and frames. Those tailwinds, price/mix are largely offsetting the headwinds coming from the insurance claim costs and also the strategic investment that we are making on our manufacturing infrastructure.\nIf we move now to the OpEx side, we're successfully balancing here the investments on the new license, the incremental spending for Transition Gen S, while on the other side, we keep our G&A cost under severe control. In all of this translate in a 50 basis point margin accretion at our operating profit on an adjusted basis, while our net income on an adjusted basis expanded 60 basis points at constant currency with a double-digit growth, thanks to a slightly favorable compared to last year tax rate.\nNow I want to go to the last slide for the P&L, and it's a margin bridge. A margin bridge that I'm sure you are familiar with because it's exactly the same that we show you at the end of 2023, early '24, to comment last year results. As you can see here, you have the major building blocks, inflation, operational efficiency and strategic investment. And one by one, I will give you just a few highlights to make you understand what's driving our operating profit improvement year-over-year.\nAs expected, the inflationary impact is still there. It's still material, and it's fairly close to what we experienced during the second part of 2023. And for the vast majority, I would say, it's related to the labor cost. On the positive side, you see 280 basis points of our operating efficiencies and price mix. That's very important. We already commented the results and the delivery of GrandVision synergies. The operating leverage of our business unit, and again, our price mix dynamic, all of this playing in our favor and give us an even greater basis points accretion compared to the one, [ the weaker ] [indiscernible] last year. If you remember, in 2023, this building block was 270 basis points accretion. But with the top line, they grew 7%, now our top line is more around 5%, and our accretion is actually improved compared to 2023.\nThe last pillar before the foreign exchange is represented by the strategic investments. The strategic investment accounted for about 60 basis points and are distributed between the product innovation of Ray-Ban, the upcoming Nuance Audio hearing aids, the digital investments in our platforms and last but not least, the investment in our portfolio. All of this is translating into 50 basis points margin accretion at constant currency, clearly, a material acceleration from the 10 basis points that we commented for the full year 2023.\nAnd the last chapter of our journey today, it's represented by the free cash flow and the net debt. There are really 2 messages that I want to convey to you. First of all, EUR 971 million free cash flow generation, approximately EUR 20 million more than the free cash flow that we generated in 2023 [ in ] the first half, and that despite the currency headwinds. The second message is that we have a strong balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.5 and that gave us proper room to execute the 2 M&A transactions that were well described before by Francesco and Paul.\nAnd now as usual, let me hand it over to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you."

This is Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. Thank you for joining EssilorLuxottica Q1 revenue management call. The group's CFO, Stefano Grassi, will walk you through the revenue highlights of the first quarter of the year. After his presentation, there will be a 30-minute Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I hand it over to Stefano.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nGood evening, good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 trading update. We started the year with a mid-single-digit speed in revenue growth. Our top line was up 5.5% at constant currency, very much on target with our long-term strategic guidelines that we shared with you a couple of years ago. And we delivered this in a quarter where we have a pretty tough comparison base as Q1 2023 was up 8.6% at common currency. Our growth at current exchange rate was 3%. So clearly, you can see the impact of currency headwinds during the course of Q1.\nIn particular, the headwinds come really from 2 currencies: the U.S. dollar, and the Turkish lira. If currency now stay at those levels, you can expect those headwinds to continue throughout the remainder part of 2024, probably with a lower extent to a lower extent during the latter part of 2024. If we look at our 2 divisions, both professional solution and direct-to-consumer grew in mid-single-digit territory with positive delivery in every single region. But now, as usual, let's begin our journey across the 4 different regions, and let's start with North America, the biggest one. North America in Q1 delivered a top line up 1.7% at constant currency.\nThe Professional Solutions B2B posted low single-digit growth with frames that deliver a stronger pace than our lens business. On the freight side, optical frames were on a strong pace, double-digit growth confirming a strong momentum that we've seen in 2023. While the some part of the business was a little bit softer. And I would say it was softer in particular in 2 channels, the department store ones and the sport channel.\nNow moving to the lens part of the business. In Q1, we're positive. And in particular, we were positive thanks to a strong price mix that helped very much to sustain our top line. The channel mix was good, in particular on the ECP. ECP delivered a positive growth on our B2B side, in particular, thanks to Vision Source Alliance that delivered strong high single-digit growth during the course of the first quarter. If we now move to the Direct-to-Consumer, Happy to report that optical retail banner delivered positive comp sales in LensCrafter positive, in target optical, positive, and last but not least, positive in per vision.\nWhile on the some part of the business, we were still on the negative side. If I look at my glass half full here, I would say that we've seen a sequential improvement in the comp sales of Sunglass Hut in North America between January, February and March. In March, we actually turned into the positive territory. And in particular, let me say that the international Sunglass Hut locations, the one that were more exposed to the touristic traffic deliver high single-digit growth during the course of Q1. But now let's move to EMEA. EMEA delivered an 8.5% at constant currency in Q1. This represents a further acceleration compared to the 2022 trend in the region, is the 12th consecutive quarter, just to give a bit of a statistics here, 12 consecutive quarter of sales growth in the region. We were mid-single-digit in professional solution, and we were double digit in the direct-to-consumer segment.\nOn the B2B side, Italy, Spain, U.K. and South Africa, they all delivered mid-single-digit growth, while we were flattish in France. Price mix continued to be strong, and we see strong price mix on lenses. We see strong price mix on the frame side of the business. If we touch for a second on frames, we were pleased with the delivery in Ray-Ban, high single digit for Q1 in EMEA. We were very pleased with Oakley double-digit growth in the first quarter in EMEA, with both brands that deliver strong results in prescription as well as in Sun. If we touch a bit on the lens part of our business, I would say that we are in a very healthy shape here. And just to give you an example, the recently launched Varilux XR is now delivering strong results pretty much across the country, representing 80% of the growth that we deliver in the Varilux product category during the course of the first quarter.\nNow let's switch gears and look at the Direct-to-consumer. We were double-digit comp sales for Sun and high single digit in the [indiscernible] retail part of EMEA. So clearly, very pleased with the trend that we've seen here. Optical retail banner posted double-digit in Italy, Netherlands and U.K. were actually on the high single-digit territory. The integration with GrandVision is marching at a pretty high speed. Just to give you a couple of examples. 60% of the lens supply to GrandVision are coming today from EssilorLuxottica. 3 out of 4 photochromic lenses sold today in GrandVision are actually branded with transition.\nSo pretty compelling picture of synergy realization in GrandVision, I would say, in Q1, but in the remainder part of the year, we have a pretty good and consistent expectation as well. Brief touch on Sun retail banner, double-digit comps in Iberia. The [ DAC ] part continues to be strong at double digit, and Turkey was double digit as well. The growth is very much driven by price mix and also by volume during the course of Q1. E-commerce. E-commerce was just south of 10% growth in Q1 with all the key banner, Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, Oakley, that all delivered double-digit growth during the course of Q1.\nLet's move east now to Asia Pacific with a top line that was up 8.2% at constant currency. This was another strong quarter for the region, with double digit in China with double-digit in Korea and last but not least, with double digit in Japan. In this region, the B2B side of our business delivered a double-digit growth, while on the other side, our direct-to-consumer was on more on the mid-single-digit territory. Pretty happy with the performance and the delivery and the execution that we had in China in a pretty uncertain macro environment. The Shanghai fair that was held in the month of March was a great success story for EssilorLuxottica.\nWe showcased our products with a new Ray-Ban Asian design collection. We had more than 1,600 visitors in our stands and we engaged several key opinion leaders to talk about the most important topics for the industry, one of them, clearly, myopia management. In addition, during the course of the first quarter, we launched the EssilorLuxottica first myopia camp, that is aiming to engage more than 10,000 ECPs in China and train them on the specific benefits of progressive lenses. Last but not least, Stellest. Stellest is delivering another outstanding quarter with revenue that were up over 70%. If we now move to the direct-to-consumer. While in Direct-to-consumer, brick-and-mortar sun continues to be strong in the region with mid-single-digit comps.\nAnd we have, on one side, the Southeast Asia, where traffic, conversion and price mix were all trending in the positive territory, and we delivered double-digit comps, while on the other side, Sunglass Hut Australia was slightly negative during the course of the first quarter. If we now remain for second still in Australia. Our main optical retail banner, OPSM posted low single-digit comps in Q1 with appointment continue to be a bit soft while conversion and price/mix are improving. Now let's move to Latin America. Top line growth close to 11%, 10.9% at constant currency. This represents the 13th consecutive quarter of positive growth at constant currency.\nOn the Professional Solutions side in Brazil, we posted double-digit growth on frames, while on the lens part of the business, we turned into the negative territory in Q1, I would say, more due to a timing effect between the delivery in Q4 and the first quarter of this year. [indiscernible] posted another outstanding quarter, a double-digit pace, more than 1,000 franchisees joined the new and renovated program of [indiscernible] that was rolled out during 2023, and we except more to roll out into this program. Moving now to direct-to-consumer. Our optical business posted high single-digit comps, very much driven by the GrandVision banner in the region, in particular, the one that we're in Mexico and [indiscernible].\nAnd while we move now to the some part of our business, that business delivered low single-digit comp with strong comps in Brazil and [indiscernible], while Mexico was a bit softer during the course of Q1, especially due to the softer demand that we experienced in the Sunglass Hut location that were more exposed to touristic traffic. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for the Q&A session."

This is Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. Thank you for joining EssilorLuxottica full year 2023 results management call. The Group's Chairman and CEO, Francesco Milleri, the Deputy CEO, Paul du Saillant; and the CFO, Stefano Grassi will walk you through the business and financial highlights of last year. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I hand over to Francesco.\n\nFrancesco Milleri\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nGood morning, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining us. Today, I am glad to present EssilorLuxottica sound financial result of 2023, and give an update on our key strategic initiatives and vision. 2023 has been another record year for the group in terms of financial performance. which make us particularly proud in the context of more challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment throughout the entire year. We advanced it fast on our integration journey while delivering the richest pipeline of innovation ever. At the same time, increasing our earnings and cash flows. This gave us the confidence to propose a dividend 22% higher than the previous year. Group's total revenue reached EUR 25.4 billion, growing at a sound pace of 7.1% at constant exchange rate, third consecutive year above 7%. This reflects the deep diversification of our revenue mix while balanced across geographies trade channels, product categories and price segments.\nInnovation played a key role across all the activities, including lenses, luxury brands and wearables. The successful integration of GrandVision drove the comp sales growth at 9%, laying the groundwork for the future expansion of the businesses. The group's adjusted operating profit near EUR 4.2 billion, reaching 16.9% margin at constant exchange rates, 10 basis points higher than 2022, despite the substantial impact of the cost inflation and the investment for the future. All of that was more than offset by the business growth diversification and the operating synergies and efficiencies. Investments were related to a number of new projects, including sales force expansion, store remodeling innovative lenses such as Stellest and Varilux XR. New licensed brands, Ray-Ban meta launch as the most advanced solution is smart glasses, and the prelaunch campaign of Nuance Audio, our disruptive proposition in the hearing age space. Our vision is essentially centered around the idea that eyeglasses will be more and more equipped and empowered by technology as a new platform that can offer a wider range of digital function from good vision and good hearing to online connectivity.\nAt the same time, our business model is going towards digitalization across all the segments of the value chain to the benefit of the whole industry. We have developed a number of digital tools to empower our sales force, wholesale partners, retail stores and online platforms. We have extended depth of analytics, big data and artificial intelligence to reshape the future of the entire industry. The initiatives stand out as a part of our VisionX, Ray-Ban Meta and Nuance. Managed by the new group division, [ Elyx ], Vision X is an integrated data-driven ecosystem for eye care practitioners, a digital suite offering all the service related to the practice activities. From ordering and booking to tele-optometry and managed vision care aim at changing the entire optical store experience.\nSecond generation of our wearables, Ray-Ban Meta, has been a great success since its launch, leveraging its new and improved functionalities. The new product offer for the first time ever, live streaming and meta artificial intelligent built on top of higher-quality camera and better audio systems. It represents a simple access to fully leverage Meta AI capabilities a gateway to the future. Talking about the Nuance audio. I'm pleased to say that the product was presented at CES in Las Vegas at the beginning of January, receiving a huge deal of attention from the audience on site and online. Feedbacks were overall extremely positive from both hearing aid experts as well as people affected by target gearing loss. Investors and analysts are testing the product in trade fairs and at our Tortona experience center in Milan, giving us the same positive comments. You are all invited to test it. an audio is up for launch in the U.S. OTC market in the second half of this year.\nTo make the most of it, we are partnering with all the relevant players, including audiologists, optician, traditional hearing aid operators with the aim of merging the two industry of optical and hearing serving both the wholesale and retail channels since the beginning. In conclusion, few words on our sustainability program, in particular on carbon road map. EssilorLuxottica fully achieved the carbon neutrality target for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Europe already met in Italy and France. The group is now setting the stage to become carbon neutral globally by 2025 as it continues to improve energy efficiency across facilities and increase the use of renewable energy. Furthermore, the group committed to setting near-term emission reduction targets according to the science-based target initiatives,reinforcing its effort of addressing climate change. That's what the Board, I'm honored to chair, achieve it delivering excellent results over its entire 3-year mandate.\nIn terms of new group integration, business model evolution and quality of its financial results. with adjusted earnings increase by around 50% in the period. M&A activity remain constantly active and well focused, and it will accelerate in the next years. The new board will be appointed during the next AGM at the end of April and the Nomination and Compensation Committee has proposed to confirm all the current board members. With that, I hand over to Paul, who will drive you through some operational highlights. Thank you.\n\nPaul du Saillant\n\nDeputy CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Francesco. I'm delighted to be with you today for our full year 2023 results. Before we dive into our operational highlights, I would like to highlight the progress made together with the OneSight EssilorLuxottica Foundation on our journey to address uncorrected poor vision and bring better sight to everyone everywhere. Over the last 10 years, we have provided permanent access to Vision Care to over 700 million people by training local entrepreneurs to perform eye exam and dispense eyeglasses in underserved communities. Through these actions, around 72 million people are wearing eyeglasses provided by EssilorLuxottica. What an important step forward in the pursuit of our mission. Let's now look at what we have achieved at the heart of our business and more specifically on our product, brands, supply chain and our colleagues to complement what you heard from Francesco.\nIn 2023, we continue to deploy a large innovation from the one-of-a-kind next-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, to the new Varilux X personalized progressive lens powered by artificial intelligence. The disruptive design of Ray-Ban Rivers, the debut of the brilliant [ Vaske ] collection, the signing of the [ Moncler ] license agreement and a very rich delivery throughout the year of novelties in our house and licensed brands.\nSo much has been accomplished. 2024 will also be rich in products and brand activities. Two days ago, the transition academy took place in Florida, gathering 1,300 attendees for the unveiling of the latest transition lens generation, transition GNS. This product will feature a new exciting color palette. It will switch from clear to dark in only seconds and offer an astonishing speed of feedback. Transition genes will be launched from April in the U.S. and key countries in Europe and soon after in the rest of the world. Since November, we have introduced at the EssilorLuxottica and in our showrooms around the world, the first ever collection for our new licenses and collaborations. Just think about it, Brunello Cucinelli, Ferrari, Jimmy Choo and Roger Federer collaboration with Olivier's people, stunning new styles that will be out in the spring. In addition, the Paris Olympic games are coming this summer, and we are launching new dedicated collection for our team Oakley athletes who are in the starting blocks. We will host them at the Oakley [indiscernible] in the Pallet Bona.\nWe are also advancing effectively in our fight against myopian children, building a comprehensive ecosystem, leveraging data, science, lenses, contact lenses, frames and instruments. Our revolutionary status lense is now available in 35 countries across Asia, Europe and Latin America. As you will remember, it has been granted breakthrough device designation by the U.S. FDA. And we have just been granted the status also for diffusion optic technology, spectacle lenses of side glass vision. On the supply chain side, as part of our strategy, we continue to develop capacity and flexibility worldwide. In 2023, we opened new state-of-the-art manufacturing sites in Thailand and Mexico. The facility of [ Ryan ] Thailand is one of the largest of the group. It is a fully integrated campus with frame and net production, lab service and distribution center under one roof. It will support the growth of Europe and the further expansion of the Asian markets.\nOn top of this, we have built two new locations in Mexico. An integrated site in Tijuana and the lens mass production facility in Chihuahua. Both are key in guaranting additional capacity and state-of-the-art service for the U.S. and Mexico. The laboratory of excellence, situated south of Paris will be our flagship lens laboratory. It is starting operation as we speak and will ramp up throughout the year. It represents a cornerstone in our strategy to provide local proximity at the heart of each country to deliver high level of service and implement the complete pair models. In line with our sustainability road map, these new facilities are designed to obtain the lead gold certification. Our fully integrated supply chain, as we have shared often with you is more and more bringing together lens, frame and labs under one roof to further expand our complete per capabilities, provide capacity and efficiencies for the growth and diversifying our footprint in close connection with our key markets.\nLooking at our go-to-market organization. Stefano will shortly take you through the performance of our business, and you will see the solid results that our focused teams in Professional Solutions and direct-to-consumer have achieved at the heart of each market. And this brings me to our colleagues. We are so grateful to all our teams working so hard to make our company better every day. Their talent and passion are allowing us to consistently execute our strategy in each domain. A sign of their engagement is the success of our employee shareholding plans with now 77,000 colleagues across 86 countries having a financial stake in the company. What a sign of alignment. In 2023, we also further strengthened our one company culture, designing our new core values with the input of more than 100,000 colleagues worldwide. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue our exciting and dynamic journey together with all our stakeholders. The operational initiatives we are deploying will keep fueling quality growth and continuously strengthen the company. With this, I hand over to Stefan.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning and good afternoon to everyone, and welcome to our full year 2023 earnings release. As you have seen, in 2023, EssilorLuxottica posted another year of remarkable sales performance where all the regions and all the segments delivered sales growth at both constant and caring change. Now if we look a bit closer, our fourth quarter, you might have noticed that our top line grew 7.1% at constant currency. While when we look at our results, a [indiscernible] exchange rate, you're looking at revenue up 2.4%. Clearly, the headwinds that we experienced in Q4 were driven by the main currency. We experienced in the U.S. dollar a 5% devaluation against euro, but also the Turkish lira to a smaller extent, despite the low materiality on the revenue side, played a role in our Q4 currency headwinds with a 38% devaluation against euro during the course of the quarter. Now, let's move through the different regions. And as usual, let's begin with the biggest one, North America. In North America, our top line was up 5.9% at constant currency. I remind you that our third quarter revenue in North America were up 2.1%. So we are here experiencing a material acceleration in the performance that we had in North America.\nOur B2B division, Professional Solutions delivered the second strongest quarter in 2023 with a top line in the high single-digit territory. When we look at our fourth quarter a bit closer, on the B2B side, frames posted high single-digit growth, while the lenses landed in a mid-single-digit territory. The price/mix, while the price mix continue to be strong, thanks to a strong and successful launch of Varilux XR, while on the France side, Ray-Ban Meta had a very promising ramp-up. And on the other side, that's not a news our luxury portfolio continues to be strong with Dolche Gabana, with Prada, with Versace and Ralph Lauren very much driving the growth in this part of our portfolio. A last touch of our professional solution is on the channel mix. When we look at our channel mix, we've seen a very good performance on our key accounts and our independent, in particular, in Vision Source, that grew double digits during the course of the fourth quarter and also our e-commerce partner. While on the software side, we experienced a deceleration in our department stores as well as in our sport channel.\nNow let's move to the other division, the other segment of North America, that is the direct to consumer. We have a picture here that is very much polarized. On one side, we have our optical retail banner that deliver comes close to mid-single-digit territory and sequential improvement throughout the quarter in October, in November, and in December. And all our three optical retail partner, LensCrafter, Target Optical and Per vision, they all deliver solid comp sales during Q4. Now if we look at the other side of our company, direct-to-consumer in North America, Sunglass Hut, record-quarter on negative comps, although they were better than what we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of 2023. And if I look at my glass half full here, I would say the Sunglass Hut locations that were located in international areas like L.A., Miami, New York, overall postal comp sales on a flattish territory, while the rest of the network was in a negative territory for Q4. But now let's switch gear, and let's touch Europe.\nEurope delivered 6.4% growth on a constant exchange rate during the course of the fourth quarter. This is an outstanding result. And just for the statistics, this is the 11th consecutive quarter of sales growth in the region EMEA. We had a very balanced growth between professional solution and direct-to-consumer. And this, to me, prove two things. On one side, the work that we're doing to engage our ECP across the region in EMEA, it's paying back. And on the other side, the elevation of the optical retail experience, and we talked about it many times, even during our last Capital Market Day, it's very much going in the right direction, and we can clearly see that with Grand Vision. All the countries in the region delivered positive growth in Q4. If we look at Italy, Spain, Turkey and Eastern Europe, I would probably mention the countries that really shine the most during Q4. In Professional Solutions, the growth was very much driven by the independent channel, where when we look at our different product category on the B2B side, I will probably mention lenses with a successful rollout of Varilux XR, and on the other side, our Sun business that was very much supported by our frame business in Ray-Ban as well as our luxury and premium portfolio in EMEA.\nSo this is the picture on the B2B side. Let's now move to the direct-to-consumer. On the direct-to-consumer side, it was another strong quarter. Both Optical and Sun delivered comp sales at approximately 9%. In the optical retail banners, every quarter in 2023, comps were around 9% to 10%. So very strong delivery in Q4, in particular, we were double digit in U.K. with Vision Express. We were double digit in San Murage in Italy, and we were double digit in Spain with Optical 2000 and [ MasVision ]. And I would say that those results were very much achieved thanks to a diligent approach on discount and at the same time, a bigger focus on quality and service level. The last part of our journey on the [indiscernible] consumers is clearly on Sun. The Sun retail banner deliver comps at 9%, which came on top of a very high base in 2022. Last year, we delivered comp sales close to 40%. I will probably mention here Turkey, Italy and Iberia as the top performer in the region, which, overall, I would say, shows a very compelling picture for Sun on both the B2B as well as the direct-to-consumer side.\nLet's move now East with Asia Pacific and a fourth quarter in Asia that is up 10.3% at constant currency. Every single quarter of 2023 was a double-digit pace for Asia Pacific. India, Japan and Greater China in Q4 posted growth in a double-digit territory, while Korea was in the high single-digit territory. If we look at Stellest, we sold more than 1.5 million pair of lenses in the full year 2023 with a triple-digit growth versus 2022. In addition, our product innovation, it's bringing to the market new product even in Q4. During the last quarter of 2023, we introduced in China Varilux XR. We introduced the new myopia lenses Kodak with the DOT technologies. And last but not least, we introduced two new engine machines, the ES700 and the ES800, in the direct-to-consumer side of Asia, our retail brick and mortar posted comps in mid-single-digit territory with solid double digit in Mainland China, in Hong Kong, while in OPSM, we experienced a low single-digit comps, very much driven by low volume on doctor appointments. Now the last region in the pipeline is Latin America. It's a double-digit quarter for Latin America, which I remind you comes on a material acceleration compared to the third quarter, where we recorded top line up 6.2%.\nIn Q4, our top line was up 12.7%. This represented 12th consecutive quarter in the LatAm region of positive growth at constant company. Now if you remember, where we commented the third quarter in Latin America, we had a deceleration in our trend. And we pointed out to Brazil as the main driver of that deceleration. But we felt in a way kind of confident that during the last quarter of the year, the trajectory in Brazil was going to recover that gap. And here we are, in Brazil, Q4, our top line was up double digit with both channel that grew nicely close to the double-digit territory. [indiscernible] in Brazil grew at double-digit pace, thanks to our successful rollout. We revisited the overall franchising program in MSA that we got very encouraging results in [indiscernible]. If we touch for a second now, our direct-to-consumer side of our business, optical business posted double-digit comps, very much driven by the GrandVision banner in the region, in particular, the one in Mexico, Indiandes as well as the one in Nicaragua, but on the Sun retail part, our top line grew on the low single-digit comps for the Hispanic LatAm and a double-digit pace on Brazil.\nBut now we completed our journey across the four different regions, let's now move to the profit and loss. Our 2023 profit and loss results were clearly impacted by the headwinds of currency, I would say, especially during the second half of the year. In order to appreciate better our underlying results, I will focus my commentary now more on the constant exchange results. I will skip top line because we talked till now about top line performance and focus more on our main line items of the P&L. Our gross margin was marginally dilutive during the course of 2023. We're looking at about 20 basis points of margin dilution constant currency. Here, we have, on one side, the favorable impact from price mix. And on the other side, we have the headwinds very much coming from the higher insurance claim cost the impact of some strategic investments in the operations and last but not least, the labor inflation that we experienced on the cost of goods sold.\nIf we look at now a little bit down on the P&L, our operating expenses, we experienced approximately 30 basis point decrease in our operating expenses. And this is very much a consequence of a sound control of our cost base which, at the same time, allowed us to invest in some strategic initiatives like, for example, the new licenses and the investments related to the new licenses that we recently announced. Those licenses do require additional sales force, and we are now ready to host the new licenses coming on board. All in all, our operating profit expanded 10 basis points on a full year while on a current exchange basis, we are looking at 40 basis point dilution on our operating profit. If we go down now to the net profit, our margin were 20 basis points accretive at constant currency thanks to a lower tax rate that largely offset our financial cost that increased very much in relation to the lease accounting.\nNow before updating you on the financials, I want to give you a little bit more visibility on another angle to look at our operating profit. Explaining you a bit more in detail how it did evolve between 2022 and 2023. So our overall profit as a percentage of revenue declined 30 basis points versus 2022 level. First of all, what you see on this slide is the key building blocks that explain you our profitability evolution during the year. On one side, we have the inflation impact, which accounted for about 200 basis points during the course of 2023. And that was largely driven by the increase in labor cost. On the other side, we managed well price/mix on lenses and frames. We realized a strong delivery of synergies in GrandVision, and we also were able to exploit operational efficiency and operating leverage that more than offset the impact of inflation and accounted for about 270 basis points on a full year 2023. Another important chapter here relates to what we call the strategic investments. And those strategic investments clearly have an important area for us, and I will mention 2, 3 investments here.\nOn one side, Ray-Ban Meta, the launch of new license agreements, the investment in manufacturing capacity in Thailand and Mexico and France and last but not least, the digital investment in Helix the new business units that will provide digital service to our independent ECP. And obviously, all those initiatives that are not providing a short-term return accounts for about 50 basis points in our results in 2023. The last chapter clearly is currency. From a currency, we are experiencing approximately 40 basis point dilution in the course of 2023. So this is the overall picture of operating profit progression in 2023. But now let me just have a last touch on our -- on the chapter which I believe we are all particularly proud of. And that is the free cash flow generation and our net debt position. In 2023, I believe the balance sheet of EssilorLuxottica has been stronger than ever. Our free cash flow generation was at EUR 2.4 billion for the full year, EUR 140 million higher than what we recorded in 2022.\nOur net debt was reduced in a single year by EUR 1.2 billion, and its ratio with the EBITDA is at 1.5. Last but not least, our cost of debt is just above 1% on a gross basis, which I would say it's pretty remarkable considering the current interest rate environment. So with that nice picture on our free cash flow and net debt position, let me pass it over to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you."

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nHello. On today's call are: Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSince many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation.\nYou can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales that we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites.\n[Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\n\nFabrizio Freda\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you being with us today to discuss our third quarter results and revised outlook for fiscal year 2023.\nIn the third quarter, organic sales fell 8%, at the high end of our outlook range and the sequential improvement from the decline of 11% in the second quarter. Nearly all developed and emerging markets grew organically and outperformed our expectations to offset an even slower than expected recovery in our Asia travel retail business.\nAs we discussed in February, Asia travel retail faced 2 headwinds in the third quarter. The first elevated inventory in Hainan given retailers' expectation for a more accelerated recovery proved very challenging as conversion of travelers to consumers in prestige beauty lagged historical trends as travels initially gravitated to other categories. This led to even lower replenishment orders than we anticipated.\nThe second headwind, the transition in Korea to post-pandemic regulations as traveling consumers gradually return pressured sales meaningfully. In China and Korea, the resumption of international flights was subdued. Limited visa were granted and group tours were low to restart. These factors resulted in lower-than-expected traffic in airports throughout the region, which combined with a lower-than-expected conversion further moderated replenishment orders.\nWith this said, there were bright spots for travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, Europe and the Americas. All told, Global travel retail organic sales declined 45%. This was partially offset by excellent organic sales growth of 10% in the rest of our global business.\nOur retail sales growth was even stronger than organic sales growth in many markets around the world, including China and the U.S. Encouragingly, retail sales performance is significantly ahead of organic sales results in global travel retail, which gives us confidence that the challenges in travel retail are abating with time.\nFurthermore, this strength at retail, including prestige beauty share gains in many markets demonstrated the benefits of our continued investment in innovation and building the desirability of our brands around the world. These positive retail trends are expected to continue in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted diluted EPS in the fiscal third quarter fell 75%, which was also at the high end of our outlook. We invested to fuel markets in various stage of post-pandemic recovery, launching sought after innovation, expanded brands into new markets and increasing advertising as a percentage of sales.\nAs the shape of recovery for Asia travel retail comes into a better focus, it is proven to be both far more volatile than we expected a more gradual relative to what we experienced in other markets. We are, therefore, lowering our organic sales and EPS outlook for fiscal year 2023 and as we reduce our implied fourth quarter outlook, primarily for Asia travel retail.\nFor Asia travel retail, there are 2 factors driving our revised outlook. In Hainan, the pressure from elevated inventory in the trade is proving to be deeper and longer lasting driven by the lower-than-expected consumption trend I discussed compounded by the retailer inventory tightening. Second, the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumers is evolving more slowly than we anticipated.\nHaving visited Shanghai and Hainan in March and witnessed firsthand the optimist of consumers, retailers, partners and our local teams, I'm very encouraged for the future of our business with the Chinese consumers. I also had the good fortune to officially open our new China innovation lab and met with the amazing scientists and product development specialists in the state-of-the-art R&D facility, which further bolsters my confidence in the business fundamentals.\nIndeed, the opportunity for prestige beauty in our brands with the Chinese consumer in the medium to long term remains vibrant in the domestic market, in Hainan and internationally, which remains our focus through this complex phase of recovery from the pandemic. For our fourth quarter outlook, the far slower organic sales growth than we anticipated in February is impacting profitability significantly.\nThere are 2 factors at play beyond the pressure to a big margin accretive area of our business. First, with the rest of the business growing strongly, we will continue to invest to drive the momentum in those areas. Second, strategic and necessary long-term investments in manufacturing, R&D and information technology capabilities are pressuring margin with a slower recovery of sales.\nWith this said, we are obviously not satisfied by the profitability in our revised outlook for fiscal year 2023. For the future, we are focused on a plan to further accelerate our growth in key markets, return to organic sales growth in our Asia travel retail business and skin care category and to progressively rebuild margin across brands, categories and regions.\nLet me now share more about our third quarter performance as numerous growth engines excel. Looking at regions. Each of the Americas and Asia Pacific returned to organic sales growth, which complemented ongoing gains in the domestic markets of EMEA. Developed markets from every region contribute led by the United States, the U.K. and Hong Kong while organic sales in our emerging markets rose an outstanding 17% globally.\nImpressively, in the domestic market of EMEA, we realized broad-based strengths as every category grew double digits organically. The breadth of growth engines by category was matched by the breadth of growth engines by channel led by specialty multi and online pure-play retailers, driven by the successful go-to-market strategy as we focus on high potential channels.\nIn Western Europe, our brand successfully engaged with consumers to generate trial and repeat. The examples are many: for Estée Lauder Bobbi Brown and to face driving viral success on TikTok to M·A·C leveraging Paris Fashion Week for its M·A·C Locks Inc. lipstick launch and La Mer hosting dermatologists for a unique event. These collective initiatives featuring enticing innovation and hero products drove the company's accelerating prestige beauty share gains for the quarter in Western Europe.\nLooking at Asia Pacific, it similarly delivered diversified growth. Nearly every market and each category contributed to the region's return to organic sales growth. Fragrance was a standout, rising double digit fueled by excellent performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio, led by Jo Malone, Lander, Lila and Tono Beauty. These brands hero franchises welcome new consumers into the category. While locally inspired innovation and enriching in-store services further contributed to the expansion of this promising category in the region.\nMainland China grew low single digits organically, after 4 quarters of pressure from COVID-19 restrictions and outbreaks. The beginning of the quarter was impacted by the lingering effects of the COVID cases in November, December. In January, retailers work through existing inventory as traffic gradually returned such that organic sales declined steep double digits. As of the reopening progress, organic sales rose double digits in each of February and March.\nEven in this complex quarter in Mainland China, consumer desire for high-quality products, elevated experiences and newness was clear and our brands delivered led by Estee Lauder and La Mer. For Estée Lauder skin care fuel its growth. Consumer gravitated to the brand's innovation and her heroes across franchises, most especially is luxury-oriented renutrib as well as Supreme. La Mer further contributed, boosted by its expert beauty adviser offering, differentiated services and the launch of the reformulated moisturizing sub cream, which attracted new consumers with its advanced benefits.\nEncouragingly, for the third quarter, our prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China accelerated sequentially driven by skin care as well as both online and brick-and-mortar.\nIn the Americas, the United States returned to organic sales growth, invigorated by strategic go-to-market initiatives and innovation to engage existing as well as new consumers. The ordinary sort owing to its heroes and the winning stake of innovation with the latest being Multi-Peptide Eye Serum, which is bringing in the new consumer demographic. Seater introduction of the revamped nutritious franchise focused on Jet with all new skin care products and launched exclusively with Ulta Beauty realized strong initial uptake.\nLooking at makeup in the United States, M·A·C, Clinique and Tofas fueled excellent performance with targeting initiatives to serve various consumer demographics across freestanding stores, specialty-multi and department stores. For clinic, it is a case study in successfully leveraging viral success of a product. In each case, almost lipstick in Black Honey to drive organic sales growth in many subcategories.\nAcross regions, emerging markets showed their promise as a long-term growth engine as our in-market team executed with excellence to meet the local needs of consumers. The double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets this quarter extends our fiscal year-to-date momentum with strong contribution from India and Brazil.\nGlobally, our diverse portfolio of brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth, M·A·C, Tom for Beauty, the ordinary and Le Labo each contributed strong organic sales growth and demonstrated the gains to be had across our large scaling and developing brands. M·A·C with its global reach, Esperta service-oriented freestanding stores continue to realize the evolution of the makeup renaissance as markets progress in recovery from the pandemic. Furthermore, the brand leverage its market-leading EMV ranking with high impact activation and product launches in makeup.\nConsumers also embrace M·A·C new hyper-real franchise in skin care, which should represent an incremental growth engine for the brand over time. Importantly, it real is another example in our portfolio of exciting East to West innovation as it was born in Asia Pacific and launched globally.\nTom Ford Beauty delivered double-digit organic sales growth, excelling across fragrance and makeup. In fragrance, the new private blend share recollection was an instant hit while the brand extension of Tom Ford Noreste, Otepaa into perform Cartiva consumers seeking intensity and the highest quality.\nWe are thrilled to have enriched our brand portfolio last week when we acquired Tom Ford, a power player in luxury with promising growth opportunities ahead. The deal is a wonderful outcome of our successful journey with the brand, which began when we collaborated to create Tom Ford Beauty over 15 years ago.\nThe ordinary ingredient-focused product prospered in its heritage markets as well as in new markets evidenced by the brand very successfully February launch in the Middle East. While Le Labo continued to evolve from strength to strength globally, rising 60% organically.\nIn closing, while we are lowering our outlook for fiscal year 2023 to reflect the deeper pressure in Asia travel retail given its standard recovery and related retail inventory tightening. We are encouraged by the strong momentum in the rest of our business.\nLooking ahead, we are focused on a strong acceleration, balanced organic sales growth across regions, categories and channels and progressively rebuilding margin. Indeed, consumer demand is robust for our diverse portfolio of brands in developed and emerging markets globally, evidenced in both organic sales growth and retail sales trends. This drives our confidence in the future.\nTo our employees, I extend my deepest gratitude for your exceptional dedication to our company and each other amid a difficult external environment. You have demonstrated an unwavering passion to exceed consumer desires around the world with our beautiful portfolio of brands.\nI will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales declined 8% and earnings per share decreased 75% to $0.47. As Fabrizio mentioned, despite continued challenges in our Asia travel retail business, we experienced accelerated growth across our markets globally with nearly every market expanding as they progress through various stages of recovery from the pandemic.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Asia/Pacific region rose 7%, with nearly all markets contributing led by Hong Kong, which doubled in size, partially due to the return of Chinese travelers while Australia grew nearly 50% and Japan rose double digits.\nMainland China also returned to growth this quarter, showing positive signs of recovery in February and March after the pressure from the increase in COVID cases and slower retail traffic in January. Throughout the region, markets continued to progress in recovery with fewer COVID restrictions compared to last year, leading to growth in all product categories with the return of brick-and-mortar traffic. Strong double-digit growth from the region's emerging markets contributed 1 point to Asia Pacific's growth.\nOrganic net sales in the Americas rose 6%, led by the United States. In North America, organic net sales grew mid-single digits, reflecting growth in skin care, makeup and fragrance. The Ordinary, M·A·C and Le Labo excelled each rising double digits in the quarter. Specialty multi-growth including distribution expansion, drove the increase in brick-and-mortar along with contributions from freestanding stores and department stores.\nIn Latin America, organic net sales grew double digits, benefiting from growth in every country and in all product categories with particular strength in makeup and fragrance. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region fell 24%, driven entirely by the travel retail business. Our global travel retail sales continued to be pressured by our Asia travel retail business, which Fabrizio described. Outside of Asia, we experienced double-digit sales growth in travel retail as international travel increased throughout Europe and the Americas.\nThe overall performance in travel retail more than offset the organic net sales growth from the rest of the EMEA region, where we drove strong performance in all product categories and from nearly all channels of distribution. Organic net sales rose across both developed and emerging markets, led by the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Turkey as the progression to recovery continued and tourism resumed.\nFrom a category standpoint, fragrance continued its momentum as organic net sales rose 14%. Strong demand for our products and high-touch services as well as innovation fuel growth across every geographic region. Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and Estée Lauder each grew double digits in the quarter.\nOrganic net sales in hair care grew 3% and sales were virtually flat in makeup. Makeup growth in the Americas, Asia Pacific and the markets in EMEA, excluding travel retail, was offset by the pressures in Asia travel retail. M·A·C and Clinique continued to drive makeup recovery and double-digit growth from Tom Ford Beauty and Too Faced also contributed. Nearly every market in Asia Pacific realized strong growth in the category, partially offset by softness in Mainland China.\nOrganic net sales in skin care fell 17% due to the pressures affecting Asia travel retail. The declines from La Mer and Estée Lauder were partially offset by standout performance from The Ordinary and M·A·C. The Ordinary benefited from strong growth in specialty-multi channels, particularly in the U.S. as well as from geographic expansion into India and the Middle East this year as well as the success of new product innovation.\nThe launch of M·A·C's hyper-real product franchise expanded its offerings in the category and contributed to growth. Our gross margin declined 750 basis points compared to last year largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes obsolescence charges, higher promotional costs and gift sets to drive increased consumption, excess overhead absorption in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year given higher inventory levels and less favorable brand and category mix.\nOperating expenses increased 570 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. We continued our investments to support recovery markets in areas such as advertising, promotional activities and innovation, which collectively increased 230 basis points compared to last year.\nOperating income declined 66% to $316 million, and our operating margin contracted 1,320 basis points to 8.4% in the quarter. Despite the volatility that has significantly impacted net sales, we have sustained certain of our strategic investments to support recovery in select markets and the strengthening of our multiple engines of growth. We've continued to invest in areas imperative to long-term profitable growth, including innovation, advertising, the growth of our emerging markets, the geographic expansion of some of our brands, production capacity and consumer engagement.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 43.1% compared to 21.3% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to the expected further reduction in earnings related to our travel retail business for fiscal 2023.\nDiluted EPS of $0.47 decreased 75% compared to last year. This was at the high end of our outlook despite the significantly higher than normal tax rate.\nThe impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS by 1% and 3%, respectively. For the 9 months, we generated $1 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $652 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $945 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases.\nOn April 28, we were pleased to complete the acquisition of the Tom Ford brand. The amounts paid at closing of approximately $2.25 billion were funded through a combination of cash, including the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and $250 million received from one of the licensees of the brand, Markalin. An additional aggregate amount of $300 million in deferred payments and 5% interest per annum to the sellers become due from the company beginning in July 2025. We estimate an EPS dilution to the full year of approximately $0.03 to $0.04.\nAnd now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. Clearly, this fiscal year has proven to be a perfect storm of higher-than-anticipated volatility from both global external headwinds and uncertainties surrounding the timing and pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in China and Asia travel retail.\nIn August, we expected a gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as markets and international travel began to recover from the impacts of COVID restrictions. However, the actual impacts to our business in Asia travel retail and China, to a lesser extent, have been far greater than we anticipated given the prolonged challenges from the pandemic including a slower-than-expected recovery of traffic and sales conversion in prestige beauty in these markets.\nFurther compounding this pressure is the tightening of inventory by retailers in Hainan. We now expect that a far more gradual return to normal sales growth in Asia travel retail is likely to persist into the first half of fiscal 2024. In addition, higher inflation and currency volatility as well as promotions in certain markets to alleviate high stock levels more than offset our price increases and further pressured our business margins.\nIn spite of the volatility in Asia travel retail that delayed the recovery relative to what we had expected as well as the macro pressures from inflation and currency, we have been encouraged by the faster-than-anticipated improvements across many of our markets globally as they progress through various stages of recovery from the pandemic.\nWhile we are lowering our full year outlook to reflect continued decline in net sales in Asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain retailers, we plan to invest in markets where traffic and consumption are returning and expect to return to overall net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This reflects double-digit sales growth in the Asia Pacific region, including Mainland China, as well as in EMEA, excluding Asia travel retail.\nThe Americas is planned to grow single digit. Currency also continues to pressure margins relative to prior year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are certainly not satisfied with our results this fiscal year and will address plans to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business beyond this fiscal year from the current year's level.\nWhen full recovery does occur from the pandemic, we do expect the return to healthy growth of our Asia travel retail business and in our related skin care category, supported by a more normalized level of investment in selling, advertising and promotional activities, reflective of the increased brick-and-mortar traffic.\nWith these assumptions as our backdrop and using March 31 spot rates of $1.09 for the euro, $1.239 for the pound, $6.872 for the Chinese yuan and $12.97 for the Korean won. We now forecast organic net sales for the full year to decline 7% to 5%. The Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points and we anticipate an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point.\nFull year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 11.1%, an 860 basis point contraction from the prior year period primarily due to the disruptions from COVID restrictions that not only impacted sales in Asia travel retail in Mainland China, but also resulted in increased obsolescence charges, discounts and promotional expenses.\nForeign currency impacts and the strategic investments I mentioned previously are also expected to pressure margin. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27% reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings for the balance of the year.\nDiluted EPS is expected to range between $3.29 and $3.39 before restructuring and other charges and includes the expected impact of the Tom Ford acquisition I mentioned previously. This includes approximately $0.26 of dilution from currency translation.\nIn constant currency, we expect EPS to decline approximately 51%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 4 percentage points. While this has been a challenging and disappointing year, navigating through many uncertainties, the strength we are seeing in many of our recovery markets gives us tremendous optimism for the future.\nOur long-term fundamentals and strategy remain intact as does our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our brands with the investments we've made to sustain long-term profitable growth.\nOn behalf of Fabrizio and the Estée Lauder Company's leadership team, we want to extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world. We recognize that this has been an incredibly challenging year for you, and we want to thank you for your extraordinary efforts, your dedication and commitment to the company and your resilience as we continue together on our path to recovery.\nAnd that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Thanks for being with us today. I'm Giorgio Iannella from the IR team. I'm pleased to introduce our speakers Francesco Milleri, Chairman and CEO; Paul du Saillant, Deputy CEO; and Stefano Grassi, CFO of the group. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I hand over to Francesco Milleri.\n\nFrancesco Milleri\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nGood morning, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining us. Today, I am pleased to present to you EssilorLuxottica [ sound ] Financial Result of the first semester as well as its new strategic initiative in the hearing aid market. Let me start from the H1 results that we are proud of with respect to both revenue growth and margin trend. Revenue at constant exchange rates grew by 8% in the second quarter and 8.2% in the first 6 months, close to EUR 13 billion. All regions and segments were positive and contributed to growth. We just saw some softness in the U.S. market, but less material than expected as it was limited only to the sun category. So far this year, the group top line has performed well above the mid-single-digit long-term target. Thanks to its open business model, positive integration journey and higher diversification in terms of products, services, geographies, channels and segments. The adjusted operating profit delivered a robust performance in the first 6 months of the year, growing faster than sales at constant exchange rates to 18.5 margin, 10 basis points higher than last year, which is a remarkable achievement considering the impact of the cost inflation in the period.\nWhile working on the efficiency and synergies, we continue to invest in our new business model with a focus on advanced solutions in lenses like Varilux XR, disruptive technology and design like Ray-Ban Reverse, teleoptometry system and digital learning platform, [ Leonard ]. At the same time, in order to protect our profitability, we are now taking selective measures of price increase across products and countries. Today, we are proud to announce a groundbreaking strategic initiative that we gave some clues about at our last Capital Market Day. When we spoke about super audio. EssilorLuxottica is expanding into the hearing aid market with the launch of a completely new type of product Based on proprietary hardware and software. We'll combine innovative hearing aid solution and prescription glasses into one single brand-new disruptive product. This will serve more than 1 billion mild-to-moderate hearing impaired people worldwide in a completely different way, allowing them to see and hear better the world around them. See more, here more, be more. Following the recent acquisition of Nuance, the Israeli company specialized in advanced audio software technology as EssilorLuxottica has established the new division Nuance Audio.\nAt this stage, we have already built and tested prototypes with strongly supportive results. The product will be available on the market in the second half of the next year. From stigma to style, that's our journey in hearing solution. with the launch of this new category at the intersection of site and sound. We want to grow and elevate the entire hearing aid industry. like we are doing with the eye care and eyewear sector. Both business have great potential in terms of growing demand driven by population aging. As well as growing penetration of the category currently much lower in hearing aids than prescription eyeglasses. To make the most of this opportunity, we'll work in close synergy with doctors, our geologists and all industry players. To make sure we offer solutions based on the patient's needs. We also leverage the capability in advanced miniaturization, electronic components, weight reduction and wearing comfort that we have built along our journey in smart glasses. In terms of the distribution strategy, we'll serve both hearing aid and optical wholesale markets as well as our own retail network.\nA few words to conclude on our carbon road map to confirm that we are on track with the target of neutrality in Europe on scope 1 and 2 by the end of this year. This gives you the sense of the priority we assigned to our sustainability program as reflected also by our recent commitment to the size-based target initiative. With that, I hand over to Paul, who will keep talking about product and innovation in different fields.\n\nPaul du Saillant\n\nDeputy CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Francesco, and to all of you for being here with us today. As you can imagine, we are quite proud of our first half achievements. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes to share with you some key factors to keep in mind when looking at our performance in the first 6 months of 2023 and beyond. Our company is at the core of an industry that is rich of untapped opportunities and centered around basic right: The need for good vision. Leveraging our well-balanced setup in terms of geographical reach, contribution channels, product categories and brand portfolio. We can size and bring the opportunities to life where and when appropriate. We have the unique ability to deliver a resilient growth. Embedded at the heart of our organization are our people. In the past months, we strongly invested in our teams in order to retain and continue to develop our pool of talents. At an average age of 37, our employees are a young and dynamic force bringing together a vast range of competencies, blending, deep expertise with fresh ideas. The enthusiasm for our mission is a common feature. While the ever-growing number of employee shareholders representing today 72,000 colleagues is a testament to the strong sentiment of belonging inside the organization. The setup of our supply chain is catered to fulfill the diverse needs of our customers at best.\nSubstantial investment have been made this year to bring our manufacturing and logistics footprint to the next level. In the coming months, two new global integrated facilities in Mexico and Thailand will start their operation, adding extra capacity to sustain our future growth. The optimization of our lab network is underway combining the cost advantage of the industrial labs with a premium service of the proximity labs. Since the beginning of the year, the biggest industrial labs have continued their journey to operational excellence to match and exceed customer expectation, while the network of proximity labs is being strengthened. Now let's talk about innovation, which is always on top of our mind. For us, innovation is based on the holistic approach, as you know. First, embracing our active portfolio of products and brands. The powerful engine is at work to continue to refine our current product range and keep enhancing the value we bring to our customers and consumers. We regularly dropped novelties into our frame collection and deploy new lens generations such as [indiscernible] and the transition extractive. Our latest newness was presented at the EssilorLuxotticades in Milan this month and received excellent traction.\nIn connection with this, our R&D teams are also unlocking new disruptive technologies and design to be incorporated in our products, pushing the boundaries of the industry standards. Let's take a couple of great illustration with the recent launch of two new groundbreaking technologies. First, the new Varilux XR series. It is the first high responsive progressive lens powered by artificial intelligence. The best overall progressive lens on the market. Thanks fusion of the digital twin, we are able to predict the visual behavioral profile of each consumer and provide a lens that respect the natural movements of the eye. The product has already been introduced in a number of key markets and to support the launch, we have conducted more than 30 events and roadshows in EMEA, U.S. and Brazil, reaching 18,000 customers and receiving exceptional feedback from both consumer and opticians. Second, Ray-Ban Reverse, which defines convention with an inverted lens design. The switch from a convex to a concave lens shape is a revolution and an audacious move not only from an optical but from a fashion perspective. Successfully overcoming the optical challenges which come along with the new design, the lens delivers the sharpest and most accurate vision experience. It can be fitted with 4 iconic Ray-Ban styles. Aviator, wafer, Caravan and Boyfriend and is made for the ones that love to be at the forefront of the new trend and express their uniqueness in every detail.\nThe product has been launched starting from May. On top of that, we are selectively adding new names to our frame brand portfolio, keeping it contemporary and attractive in the customers' eyes. On this, we are proud to share that we have just presented our first swarovski collection, which can be found on the shelves starting from the fall. During the first half of the year, we also announced the collaboration between Roger Federer and our Oliver Peoples brand and signed the new Jimmy Choo license. Our ambition is to create also brand new categories to address yet unmet consumer needs. Two new categories, which the group has embarked on our myopia management and wearables. myopia management, we have now unveiled our fourth year clinical trial results for states showing sustained myopia control efficiency. Children saved more than 1.25 director of myopia on average over the period, a huge contribution to their well-being. On wearables, the experience of our first-generation Ray-Ban stories has took us important element about the consumer relationship vis-a-vis the new functionalities. Based on these valuable insights, our R&D team are preparing the feature of the next-generation to come. As you can see, the breadth of our products, brand and categories is underpinned by deep innovation and a robust end-to-end organization, which is at the heart of the growth of our company and the development of our industry. With this, I am handing it over to Stefano. Thank you.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to our first half 2023 earnings release. As usual, let's start our journey looking a bit closer to our top line first. And then take a closer look to our profit and loss and financial position. Our second quarter revenue were up 8% at constant currency, while on a current exchange rate, you're looking at top line up 4.9%. I remind you that the 8% growth comes on top of a 7% sales growth that we recorded in the second quarter of last year. So we continue to grow our top line above the mid-single-digit guidance even against a tougher comparison base. From a currency standpoint, after 7 consecutive quarters of currency tailwinds, we're now experiencing some headwinds in our results. And those headwinds are quantifying about 3 percentage points as the difference between constant and current change results for the second quarter. The main driver for that is the U.S. dollar, but I would also add the Turkish lira and the Chinese renminbi. If currency stays at those level, we do expect those headwinds to carry on during the remainder part of 2023. For the first 6 months of the year, as you can see in the slide, we're looking at 8.2% growth at constant currency and 7.1 our growth at current exchange rate. But now let's start our journey across the different geographies. And as usual, let's begin from the biggest one, North America. North America posted a top line up 2.3% at constant currency during the course of the second quarter. With the first half results overall at 4.5% still at constant currency.\nBoth professional solution and Direct to Consumer progressed at an even pace throughout the second quarter. If we look at our professional solution, our price/mix was very strong on both frames as well as lenses. If we look at our lens business, we posted solid growth in Q2, very much driven by our EC channel. And this is obviously very promising as we are now approaching the launch of Varilux XR in the U.S. during the course of the third quarter. On the French side, after a good first quarter, we've seen clients a bit more cautious on the reordering side and that caused a bit of a deceleration during the quarter. But we had the Ray-Ban brand that was still strong in Q2 and the luxury that delivered double-digit growth during the course of the quarter. If we now switch gear and move to the Direct to Consumer. On the Direct to Consumer, we posted solid growth in Q2 with our optical retail banner with LensCrafters per vision target optical, they all posted solid comp sales during the course of the second quarter. Conversely, our Sunglass Hut banner in North America had negative comps during the course of the quarter, with a deceleration that was a bit stronger on the Sunglass Hut location that were not exposed to the touristic traffic.\nLet's move now to EMEA. That is a story of sequential acceleration. During the first quarter, EMEA recorded a top line up 8.9% at constant currency, while in the second quarter, we're now delivering 10.6% at constant currency. Professional Solutions posted a high single-digit growth, while our Direct to Consumer segment was actually up on the double-digit pace. When we look at our professional solution, we posted double-digit growth in Italy, in Spain, as well as in Turkey and a high single-digit growth in France and in Middle East. From a channel mix standpoint, the large account, the buying groups, the ECP, they all posted solid growth during the course of the second quarter. Our branded lens portfolio is solid with a high single-digit growth, and I believe it will be even stronger with the progressive rollout of Varilux XR throughout the region. So far, we have very promising results. We engaged more than 18,000 ECPs across the region that participated to several roadshows in Europe. 19 countries have been activated, and we already see a strong penetration of Varilux XR within the Varilux product offering.\nWe now move for a second to Direct to Consumer. Just a couple of data here. 10% comp sales in Optical Retail EMEA and 15% comps in our Sun retail business. In the optical part of the business, we delivered double-digit growth in Vision Express in U.K., in Samara, Vigano in Italy and proudly so in our optical banner in Ukraine. On the Sun retail banner, we are very pleased with the 15% comp because they come on top of 80-plus percent that we recorded in the second quarter of 2022. Although some markets were very positive in the region, and the main driver of the growth was the large retail stores that we have across Europe, the one that are located in the prime location, in particular in department stores and premium shopping malls and that do represent about 1/4 of the overall revenue base in Sunglass Hut in Europe. And now let's move east to Asia Pacific, another story of sequential improvement in the performance. You remember First quarter in Asia Pacific, we delivered 12% at constant currency. In the second quarter now, we are approximately 24% at constant currency. On our Professional Solutions side, we were double-digit in China, in India as well as in Korea. In China, we experienced a further boost on the B2B channel with both lenses and frames that delivered double-digit growth. With our starless lens, our Myopia solution, the group on the triple-digit territory for the second quarter, marching, I would say, at a higher pace, higher than expected to hit the 1 million pairs to be sold by the end of 2023 globally.\nSwitching to Direct to Consumer, both optical and some banners delivered double-digit comps primarily driven by the strong rebound that we experienced in China. Last region in the pipe, it's Latin America. Latin America that delivered 9.3% top line growth at constant currency. We had a mid-single-digit growth in our professional solution with Mexico that delivered double-digit pace as the main growth driver in the region. The lands category was very much the primary category in terms of growth, and that was very much thanks to a strong price mix with Eisen, Varilux, Kodak that all delivered double-digit pace. While when we look at our France side of our business, we were double-digit in Brazil, and we were double digit actually in both optical as well as Sun with all our main brands, Ray-Ban, Oakley and our luxury portfolio that will deliver double-digit pace. If we move now to our Direct to Consumer. Our 1,600 optical stores in the region they grew on a double-digit comp sales, very much led by GMO and the former GrandVision banner. While if we look at our some part of the business, our retail chain delivered a mid-single-digit comp sales during the course of the second quarter. But now we have concluded our journey across the 4 different regions.\nAnd now let's take a closer look into our profit and loss results. When we look a bit closely our profit and loss, I would say that we're pretty happy with the profitability results that we deliver for the first half of 2023 despite a quite severe inflationary headwinds that impacted our profit and loss. I would quantify those headwinds in about 250 basis points impacting our H1 2023. And if we now look at a bit closer to our P&L, our gross margin show approximately 20 basis points dilution. I would say that we have two things. On one side, the main driver of that margin dilution is the higher claim costs that we experienced during the first half of the year on our managed vision care assets. And that dilution was largely offset by strong price mix as well as manufacturing efficiencies. When we look at our operating expenses, their incidents on revenue decreased approximately 30 basis points, very much stands to a strong and diligent management of our cost base. So overall, when you look at our profit and loss, you have an operating profit that on an adjusted basis showed 10 basis points of margin expansion at constant currency. While if you look at our results at current exchange rate, you're looking at 10 basis point dilution at 18.3% as a percentage of revenue.\nNow the bottom of the P&L is our group net profit. And here, you have 10 basis points margin accretion to a 13% net profit as a percentage of revenue. While when you look at our result, at current exchange rate, our margin is flat versus the first quarter of last year. Now the last chapter is our financial position. You can see on the picture on the headlines over there, EUR 954 million free cash flow generation. That represents approximately 50 million more than the free cash flow that was generated last year and is the second larger free cash flow generation in Essilorluxottica history for the first semester. Let's touch on net debt to EBITDA. We continue our journey of deleveraging. We're well below 2, more precisely a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6. With that, we completed our journey today. Let me hand it back to the operator for the Q&A session. Thank you."

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSVP of IR, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nHello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nTo facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nAs a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\n\nFabrizio Freda\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased complexity, we delivered organic sales down 5%, in line with our outlook, and adjusted diluted EPS higher than expected.\nEven in these conditions, our multiple engines of growth strategy empower us to seize prevailing growth opportunities. Indeed, we realized outstanding performance in many developed and emerging markets around the world to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia travel retail and domestic China as well as tighter inventory management by some retailers in the U.S.\nTo reflect these prolonged and heightened external pressure, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year 2023, most notably for the second quarter. While Tracey will discuss our revised outlook in detail, there are 3 primary drivers. The first is the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restriction in Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan.\nThe restrictions are leading to a slower return of tourism versus what retailers had anticipated, resulting in tightening of inventories. While it is significant, this near-term temporary pause does not diminish our deep conviction in Hainan for the long term as it is among the best brand-building destination for new consumers acquisition.\nThe second driver is the tightening of inventory by some retailers in the U.S., and the third is the far stronger U.S. dollar. Encouragingly, beyond these headwinds, consumer demand is robust in markets which are emerging from the pandemic, evidenced in the underlying fundamentals of our first quarter results and retail sales growth.\nOur optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty is intact. During fiscal year 2023, we plan to continue investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to grow profitable prestige beauty share.\nWe expect a gradual sequential improvement to low double-digit organic sales growth and high teens adjusted EPS growth on a reported basis in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As these pressures begin to abate, the momentum in other areas of our business builds and our ongoing investments drive growth.\nLet me now share some insights from our first quarter. As while we had headwinds, we also had many bright spots that give us confidence in the second half and beyond. We realized double-digit organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Japan and the U.K. grew strongly, alongside Brazil, India, the Middle East and Thailand, to name just a few.\nBrick-and-mortar prospered in these markets as we welcome consumers with high-touch services, engaging activations and newness. Domestic China delivered sequentially improving organic sales trends of down single digits driven by excellent growth online, a better performance in brick-and-mortar.\nOur luxury brands, La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty, contributed to online growth, as did Aveda and Bobbi Brown, among others. We are very encouraged by the terrific results of our expanded consumer reach on JD and Douyin. From a retail sales perspective in the online channel, we grew nearly twice as fast as prestige beauty in China to gain share.\nIn the U.S., our freestanding store excelled, benefiting from both enhanced omnichannel capabilities and greater demand for our high-touch services, be it artistry at M·A·C or personalization at Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Specialty-multi also performed especially well, powered by traditional stores and enhanced by the partnership of Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's. Clinique, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown led growth. Given excellent results in Ulta Beauty over the last year, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown are further expanding their presence.\nWe continue to see promise in the U.S., evidenced in its overall retail sales growth in prestige beauty despite the recession risk and the strong performance our brands delivered in freestanding stores and specialty-multi. We remain committed to investing in innovation, advertising and granular consumer acquisition strategies as we aim to best capture the market growth opportunities.\nLooking at brands globally. 13 brands rose organically, collectively increasing high single digit to represent over half of our organic sales. Among the 13, M·A·C excelled in makeup, La Mer in luxury skin care, Jo Malone London in fragrance and Aveda in hair care. While The Ordinary, our newest brand, appeal to consumers with its authenticity and innovative approach to ingredient transparency.\nFragrance sales rose an outstanding 18% organically and expanded in every region. Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle all contributed, driven by sought-after innovation and heroes as our luxury and artisanal portfolio evolves from strength to strength.\nFor example, Jo Malone London's momentum continue with gains balanced across the regions. Innovation served as a catalyst for growth. In China, the new Night Collection resonated beautifully as did the limited edition Brit Collection. Globally, the brand brilliantly leveraged its hero strategy, creatively reimagining the power of English pear and freesia, in a campaign to recruit new consumers.\nDemand for fragrance was even stronger as ongoing supply issues of glass and componentry constrains this still excellent sales growth. Profitability for fragrance improved despite the significant currency headwinds, further evidence of the benefits derived from our strategic pivot to the higher end of the category.\nHair care double-digit organic sales growth was fueled by increasingly diverse growth engines. We were thrilled to launch Aveda in Mainland China, marking our entry in prestige hair care in the market. In the U.S., Bumble and bumble realized gains from strong results in Ulta Beauty at Target and expansions into Macy's.\nIn skin care, while the Estée Lauder, Dr. Jart and Origins brands were most pressured by reduced retail traffic and travel in China, several brands still prospered. La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary grew organically driven by coveted heroes and newness to showcase the gains to be had from entry prestige through luxury.\nInnovation also resonated strongly in skin care, which bodes well for the future when these transitory pressures abate. In China, Estée Lauder luxury oriented Re-Nutriv was highly sought-after, and the launch of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum boosted overall demand for the franchise.\nClinique Smart Clinical Repair gained momentum in China and also in the U.S. as its new moisturizer complemented the regimen's popular serum and eye cream, which launched last year. The Clinique Smart franchise benefit its 360-degree marketing campaign of these 3 products, featuring powerful scientific credentials and claims.\nMakeup renaissance was evident as markets both reopened and evolved in recovery. The category growth in emerging market was especially striking a broad base from Latin America to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia, while makeup also grew in most developed markets in Western Europe, along with Japan and Korea.\nM·A·C had a remarkable quarter, fueling passion for makeup around the world, growing high single digits organically. Consumer embraced its unparalleled artistry, and the brand innovation proved captivating, especially Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick for the lipstick finish and elevated packaging as well as M·A·CStack mascara.\nM·A·C's creative marketing activations further contributed to growth. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, the brand's TikTok challenges realized standout results, driving significant new consumer acquisition on Lazada's Super Brand Day, a strong double-digit volume growth across Latin America as over 400 content creators contributed to the campaign.\nBefore I close, I'm also pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2022 social input and sustainability report. It features exciting progress, made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. The report also details new goals for electric vehicles, water reduction and responsible sourcing. Finally, on the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we were taking to make more progress in our commitment to racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are also reflected in the report.\nIn conclusion, the current external pressures are many. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our focus on advancing our long-term growth strategy, further balancing and diversifying our multiple engines and fully leveraging the long-term promise of prestige beauty. We aim for fiscal year 2023 to be another year of progress on our strategy despite the headwinds.\nIn the first quarter alone, we set the stage to expand our luxury portfolio, having announced a deal to create BALMAIN BEAUTY with the couture fashion house. We extended our consumer reach in productive distribution in high-growth channels to match success across regions and continue to strategically expand brands into new countries with Aveda launch in domestic China. We also welcome colleagues into our new China innovation labs in Shanghai, amplifying our ability to best create for the Chinese consumer. And we began limited production for skin care in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo.\nI would like to close with my deepest thanks to our employees for their exceptional commitment amid the complexity of the environment. Your creativity, wisdom and passion are beyond compare. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5%, and earnings per share was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations, and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter. While sales overall met expectations, our mix of sales was different than we expected.\nIn August, our outlook anticipated that first quarter sales would be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan, with gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as the restrictions lifted.\nHowever, the impact on our first quarter sales was greater than we anticipated in Hainan as stores were closed for most of the quarter. And as they reopened, traffic remained quite modest, which resulted in lower shipments due to the anticipation of a slower pace of recovery.\nOur outlook also reflected the comparison to the prior year in the U.S. when certain of our retailers secured shipments earlier for holiday due to supply chains and concerns, in stark contrast to the tightening of inventory by retailers this year due to concerns about slower traffic.\nOur actual results for the quarter reflect even tighter-than-expected inventory management with certain retailers in the U.S. These additional headwinds were somewhat offset by a faster pace of recovery in other parts of Asia/Pacific and in EMEA as well as the benefit of strategic pricing actions we took in July and August.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%, reflecting the timing of shipments in the prior year as well as the tightening of inventory this year. The timing of shipments in the U.S. contributed 6 percentage points to the overall region's prior year growth.\nIn Latin America, nearly all markets grew double digits, fueled primarily by the strong recovery of makeup. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales declined 5%, primarily due to continued challenges in travel retail and APAC, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%.\nOur global travel retail business declined as the ongoing COVID restrictions in China curtailed travel to Hainan. Stores there were closed for most of the quarter, and traffic has been slow to return, resulting in lower shipments as we support stricter inventory management with certain retailers. Conversely, travel retail sales in European markets and in the Americas rose triple and double digits, respectively, boosted by increasing resumption of professional and personal travel.\nNet sales in the United Kingdom increased with double-digit growth from The Ordinary. Elsewhere in EMEA, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the return of tourism in the region drove growth in many markets led by India, the Middle East and Turkey, and resulted in double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar.\nOrganic net sales in our Asia/Pacific region fell 7% due to the ongoing COVID restrictions impacting brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and travel retail in Korea. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr. Jart's travel retail business. The rest of the region delivered strong net sales growth led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Many markets in the region continue to recover as restrictions lifted and traffic returned to stores.\nFrom a category perspective, fragrance led growth, with organic net sales rising 18%. Strong consumer demand for our brands and innovation drove growth. Our luxury and artisanal brands continue to thrive, led by Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Net sales from Clinique rose strong double digits, winning across all regions with the Clinique Happy product franchise.\nOur hair care net sales rose 11% organically. Aveda led category growth, driven by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from hero products and strong innovation, including the launch of the Color Control product line.\nOrganic net sales in makeup declined 6% driven by the COVID restrictions in China as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of shipments for holiday in the U.S. Net sales rose strong double digits in Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets of EMEA due to strong performance from M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Estée Lauder.\nM·A·C continues to be an overall top performer, driven by the success of both hero products and strong innovation across the foundation, lip and eye subcategories. Organic net sales in skin care declined 11%. This category has been the most impacted by the COVID restrictions in Hainan, where skin care accounts for a majority of our business.\nOur gross margin declined 190 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and inflationary pressures in our supply chain. Operating expenses increased 250 basis points as a percent of sales driven by the reduction in sales. Operating income declined 29% to $668 million, and our operating margin contracted 440 basis points to 17% in the quarter.\nDiluted EPS of $1.37 decreased 28% compared to the prior year, slightly better than expected as a result of effective cost management. The impacts from foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations and the exit of certain designer licenses negatively impacted diluted EPS by 4% and 3%, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, we utilized $650 million in net cash flows from operating activities, reflecting increased working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels as well as lower net income.\nWe invested $152 million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements, online capabilities and distribution expansion. We returned $325 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and additionally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. So again, we delivered our overall quarter 1 results as we anticipated.\nNow let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. While we believe the headwinds that impacted our first quarter results are largely temporary, it is also apparent that both the timing and speed of the stabilization of inflation and recovery from both the pandemic and currency challenges are uncertain.\nAs retailers in Hainan were prepared for a faster recovery of traffic to the island with their inventory levels of our products, we have further modified our shipments to be more in line with the slower retail environment. And although we expect the adjustment to inventory by certain of our retailers, corresponding with potentially lower traffic, to continue into the second quarter, particularly in Hainan, we believe this adjustment will subside in the second half as COVID restrictions ease and consumers begin to travel with less safety restrictions in China. Until that happens, ongoing restrictions are expected to result in lower net sales in these areas.\nWe also anticipate the tighter inventory management in the U.S. to abate in the second half given the still strong demand for our products at retail. We expect the remainder of our first half performance to be pressured as we navigate through these uncertainties. Despite the headwinds to net sales, we remain confident in the strength of our business strategy and expect to sustain our investments to drive long-term profitable growth.\nWe plan to continue to invest in the areas of advertising, innovation, production capacity, consumer engagement as well as new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands.\nFor the second half, we anticipate trends to improve sequentially as restrictions are lifted, travel throughout Greater China, including Hainan, progressively resumes and the tightening of inventory subsides in Asia travel retail and in the U.S. We expect continued recovery in various markets in EMEA and Asia/Pacific for the balance of the year.\nCurrency is also projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in the second quarter and for the full year as the U.S. dollar has continued to rapidly strengthen against key currencies. As we entered fiscal 2023, we took strategic pricing to mitigate higher-than-normal inflation. Both the magnitude and speed of currency movements experienced thus far, combined with inflation, have further suppressed our expectations for the balance of the year.\nSpecifically, based on mid-October spot rates of 0.978 for the euro, 1.122 for the pound, 7.29 for the Chinese yuan and 14.36 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to continue to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the second quarter and for the full year.\nWe expect organic sales for our second quarter to fall 11% to 9%, primarily reflecting the continued risk of disruption in Hainan, leading to further tightening of inventory and continued tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the U.S. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 7 points, with an additional 2 points due to the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations.\nThe impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 to $1.29 for a decline between 60% to 57%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.20 such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 54% and 50%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of approximately 7 percentage points.\nFor the full year, we expect organic sales growth to range from flat to up 2%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 6 percentage points, and we expect an additional 2 points of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.\nThe impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities and sales from certain designer license exits are each expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 16.1%, a 360 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, foreign currency impacts and the strategic investments I previously mentioned.\nWe now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings and less benefit from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.25 and $5.40 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.44 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 21% to 19%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 10 percentage points.\nIn closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our multiple engines of growth strategy. Despite the temporary external challenges, we plan to continue to invest selectively in strategic priority areas to support the ongoing growth of our amazing brands now and into the future and to gain profitable share globally.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSVP of IR, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nHello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSince many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nTo facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency, and all organic net sales growth excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation.\nYou can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\n\nFabrizio Freda\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. I'm grateful to be with you today to reflect on our record results for fiscal year 2022 and discuss the drivers of our outlook for fiscal year 2023.\nWe leveraged our strengths amid the prolonged pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine and the onset of higher inflation. Our multiple NGO growth strategy, flexible financial model and exceptional talent enabled us to deliver record performance. At the same time, we invested for long-term growth, reflecting our confidence in the vibrancy of prestige beauty now and in the future.\nWe achieved better-than-expected results in our fourth quarter, leading to above guidance organic sales growth of 8% for fiscal year 2022. Reported sales rose 9% despite heightened foreign exchange pressure to end the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to an all-time high of 19.7%. We realized this greater profitability even as our growth engines diversified beyond our highest margin categories.\nFragrance, makeup and hair care delivered double-digit sales growth on a reported basis to complement our robust skin care business. Impressively, 9 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth for the year despite the significant pressure from COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter. La Mer, Jo Malone London and Le Labo showcased the strength of our portfolio across our large, scaling and developing brands, respectively. M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique powered makeup emerging renaissance, with double-digit gains in the category as Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty elevated fragrance to new heights with striking growth.\nOur geographic diversity has been a distinct benefit during the pandemic, allowing us to create and capture growth where opportunities presented themselves around the world. Asia Pacific led growth in fiscal '20 and '21 as markets in the West were more negatively impacted by COVID-19, while the Americas and EMEA drove growth in 2022 as the East confronted renewed pressure from the virus.\nToday, our $17.7 billion in annual reported revenues tops prepandemic levels by 19% fueled by organic sales growth and enhanced by our acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points over the 3 years. Our trusted brands with the hero products and sought-after innovation have thrived, while our increasingly flexible cost structure has served us well.\nOur focus on hero product had been a winning strategy. This high repeat loyalty-inducing products have grown significantly as a mix of our business since fiscal year 2019. Throughout, we have continued to innovate to propel our hero strategy for the years ahead. Innovation served as a powerful catalyst for growth this year, representing over 25% of sales once again.\nOur [newness] exceeded consumer desires due to our exceptional data analytics, R&D and creative capabilities. La Mer's Hydrating Infused Emulsion, Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv diamond serum and MACStack mascara are among our breakthrough launches this year, driving favorable earned media value and strong new consumer acquisition.\nTurning to category performance. Fragrance grew a stunning 32% organically for the year. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle each rose strong double digits and expanded in every region, including excellent results in travel retail in EMEA. Estée Lauder brand launched the luxury collection, and AERIN contributed double-digit gains. The outstanding performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this accretive segment of the category.\nConsumers' behaviors during the [market] pandemic reinforced fragrance as part of self-care and solidified online as the destination for the category to explore, learn and purchase. Our brands stepped up to create and leverage these new dynamics. We capitalized on the recovery in brick-and-mortar in many markets, realizing high levels of engagement in freestanding stores, while online continue to prosper for the category.\nMakeup remitted a powerful growth engine in fiscal year 2022. Strong double-digit organic sales gains in the Americas and EMEA more than offset a double-digit decline in Asia Pacific. As markets in the West reopened, leading to more social and professional use educations, the makeup renaissance emerge.\nOur brand excelled, with innovative artists as well as new products, which focused on performance, ingredient narratives and skinifications of makeup. We leveraged increased traffic in brick-and-mortar, which allowed us to reestablish our well-loved services in store to realize terrific growth in services.\nHair care proved to be a valuable growth engine, contributing double-digit organic sales growth. The unique value proposition and go-to-market strategy for each of Aveda and Bumble and bumble resonated with consumers who increasingly expect the benefits of quality products and performance-based ingredients.\nThe skin care category was the most impacted from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific in the second half of the fiscal year as the restriction reduced traffic in brick-and-mortar as well as travel retail and also temporarily curtailed our distribution capacity in Mainland China. In this context, we delivered solid results as excellent performance from La Mer, Clinique, Bobbi Brown offset pressure from other brands.\nLa Mer had a remarkable year. Consumers around the world gravitated to its [iconic and robust] innovations, embracing newness like The Hydrating Infused Emulsion and the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion to expand their regimens. Genaissance de la Mer lifted sales further as consumers traded up to the brand ultra-luxury franchise for its artisanal quality, unparalleled efficacy and high-curated experiences.\nClinique and Bobbi Brown's success in skin care demonstrated the execution of our sophisticated hero strategy to drive strong repeat and consumer loyalty. Clinique heroes across categories from makeup remover to serum to moisturizer provided it with a winning formula, while Bobbi Brown's global and regional hero philosophy is driving its mix of business in skin care much higher.\nLooking now at channels. Both brick-and-mortar and online served as growth engines for the year as we pushed exciting initiatives to amplify our omnichannel capability. Let me share a few of the highlights. Brick-and-mortar rebounded strongly in the America and EMEA as specialty multi, freestanding stores and department store all contributed. Our Post-COVID Business Acceleration program enabled us to improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building, experiential brick-and-mortar footprint as intended.\nOnline grew mid-single digits organically led by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific. This in high online penetration boosted reported sales growth in the channel to double digits. Our online channel encompassing brand.com, third-party platforms, pure-play retailers and retail.com is now far more than twice as big prepandemic fiscal '19. China and the U.S., which already high online penetration, have expanded further, while markets in EMEA have seen a surge in online penetration that are now able to realize the benefits of scale.\nDuring the year, we diversified in high-growth channels globally to expand our consumer reach. Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins initially launched on JD in China, and given the insight gain as well as new consumer acquisition trends, we introduced more brands on JD. Jo Malone London and La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia, and many brands participated in the emerging Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora and Kohl's partnership in the U.S., both in store and online.\nWe continue to innovate across the online ecosystem to generate trial and repeat. In Latin America, which has historically been a strong market for direct selling, we leverage WhatsApp and drove social selling to represent 30% of online sales in the region. Around the world, our beauty advisers and makeup artists became content creators for always-on creation across social media platforms like TikTok. This showcases the powerful evolution of the reach and scale of our expert advice, which now stands well beyond brick-and-mortar.\nWe also advanced our omnichannel strategy meaningfully this year. In North America, most of our freestanding stores are now equipped with fulfillment capability. We also began to stand up these features in EMEA and Asia Pacific. These new capabilities are driving higher average order values and convincing upsell trends.\nAt the same time, we extended the reach of our loyalty programs globally, introducing programs in Japan, Italy and Mexico, and expanding offering in other markets across EMEA and Asia Pacific. Here, too, the results are compelling. We are realizing greater purchase frequency, higher level of retention from consumer engaged in loyalty programs.\nDuring the fiscal year, we also progressed our ESG goals and commitments. We continue to make strides on our climate action strategy, including the expansion of our renewable energy portfolio across our direct operations globally, and we're recognized by a leading NGO for our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity. In packaging, we set a more ambitious goal to increase the post-consumer recycled content of our packaging to 25% or more by the end of 2025 and set a new goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum packaging to 50% or less by the end of 2030.\nWe expanded employee resource groups, a great source of community and unity. Our network of Black leaders and executives launched in Brazil while wELCome, our group of LGBTQIA+ employees, launched in EMEA. We created a group for our ageless employees and continue to scale our reverse mentoring program globally, pairing more junior talent with senior leaders to share insights and perspectives on trends to drive better business decisions and foster career development.\nWe brought our unique signature women leadership program, Open Doors, to our international markets, with continued great success in promoting our next generation of women leaders. We realized important progress with the From Every Chair leadership development program. Its inaugural class has already achieved high level of career mobility in the forms of promotions and new roles for Black employees. We are encouraged by these initial results and look forward to continued success from this sponsorship program, which we created for equitable advancement and professional development of our Black talent.\nBefore I talk about the year ahead, let me conclude on fiscal year 2022 by speaking about DECIEM, which complemented our organic sales growth. The Ordinary, DECIEM's ingredient-based brand, diversified in exciting ways over the last few months. The brand launched in India and Malaysia, expanded its hair care offering, and also introduced Multi-Peptide Lash and Brow Serum to extend its authorities in treatment. From each innovation exceeding expectation to outstanding initial results in Nykaa in India, The Ordinary enters fiscal year 2023 with promising opportunities.\nNow for the future. We refreshed our 10-year compass to help steer our ambitions and investment for the next decade. The compass reinforced our confidence showcasing the abundant growth opportunities ahead. The drivers are many, led by growing middle class globally and most especially in emerging markets; expanding usage across consumer segments, including ageless and men; and online expansion, fostering consumer access and reach.\nFrom the compass, we distilled our 3-year strategy. As we look across the next 3 years, we expect to deliver more balanced growth across categories and regions. Near term, the pandemic and macro factors will likely lead to more valuable growth by category and regions.\nWe are very confident in the strength of our company and in the vibrancy of prestige beauty. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth fueled by our diversified growth engines and enticing innovation, and to take the opportunity in a volatile year to continue investing for our exciting future to build global share.\nWhile the external challenges are many, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and currency headwinds, the enduring desirability of our brands with the hero products and high repeat rates is powerful. Additionally, our more effective cost structure, pricing power and strong cash generation should afford us the flexibility to successfully navigate the ongoing complex environment.\nInnovation is poised to be a catalyst for growth, and we began the year with exciting news. Let me share insights about 2 skin care launches. Estée Lauder upgraded Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme addresses the signs of eye agings and reflects consumer modern lifestyles of long screen times and environmental stressors. Offering notable incremental benefits from the original product, this launch demonstrates the pricing power of innovation.\nClinique Smart Clinical Repair line extended its fiscal 2022 innovation [strength] with the launch of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. The moisturizer is coupled with the powerful new claims for Smart Clinical Repair Serum to drive gains in this hero franchise.\nThis year, we expect to reignite growth engines in Asia Pacific as the pressure of COVID-19 abates. We anticipate in-store traffic levels to gradually improve in Mainland China, allowing brick-and-mortar to return to growth to complement ongoing strength online and for tourism trends to Hainan to ultimately accelerate from the most recent post, which began last week.\nWe are confident in the long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, evidenced by our expansion into almost 100 new doors and 3 additional cities in fiscal year 2022 as well as our introduction of Aveda last month. We are thrilled to enter the hair care category with Aveda, which is vegan and Leaping Bunny-approved, as the brand launched on Tmall and opened its first freestanding store in the market.\nFiscal 2023 is set to be a monumental year for us as of our Shanghai innovation lab opens, advancing our ambition to best create for the Chinese consumers, and we begin limited production in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is our first ever in Asia Pacific. With these 2 strategic initiatives, we expect to benefit over the next few years from increased speed-to-market and by further expanding our momentum with outstanding locally relevant innovation in this vibrant region.\nFor the Americas and EMEA, we anticipate ongoing strength from our growth engines across categories and channels as well as across developed and emerging markets given the broad-based gains of fiscal year 2022. For makeup, which is a vital category in both regions, the emergence of the makeup renaissance give us great confidence going into fiscal year 2023. In North America in particular, our focus turns to granular consumer growth opportunity as we have refined our distribution.\nTo close, we delivered excellent performance in fiscal year 2022, achieving record results while advancing initiatives for consumer acquisition, engagement and high-touch services and experiences to drive trial and repeat levels even higher. Today, our business is not only far bigger and more profitable than the prepandemic fiscal year 2019, but our growth drivers are more diversified, our R&D and innovation capabilities are more robust, and our cost structure is more flexible.\nWhile the year ahead most certainly has its external challenges, our company is poised for a bright future as the best diversified pure player in prestige beauty with the most talented and passionate employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude.\nI will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023.\nOur fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan, as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region.\nReported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points.\nFrom a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically, led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. Consumers continued their return to brick-and-mortar, leading to strong growth in freestanding retail and specialty multi-stores. We grew sales in nearly every market in the region, with particular strength in Canada and across Latin America.\nNet sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 9% organically driven almost entirely by the disruptions in travel retail in China and the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine. Of the remaining markets in the region, 10 rose double digit as tourists returned to the region, and consumer traffic and brick-and-mortar retail thrived. The makeup, fragrance and hair care categories rose strong double digits in EMEA, while the decline in skin care reflected the soft travel retail sales in Asia.\nGlobal travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, declined in Asia due to the COVID restrictions in China. Hainan, in particular, was impacted as stores were closed a portion of the quarter, travel was curtailed to the island and courier services for online deliveries were disrupted. However, travel retail in European markets and in the Americas rose triple digits as airport traffic returned and doors in the channel reopened.\nNet sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 19% organically. Greater China and Korea net sales were the most impacted by the COVID restriction. Hardest hit was Shanghai, where the city-wide lockdown lasted 2 months, impacting our distribution capacity serving all of China through the end of May. Overall, our brands performed well for the important 6.18 holiday festival and maintained top rankings across the beauty space on both Tmall and JD. Elsewhere in Asia, there were some other bright spots. Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam continued to recover and have begun to reopen to tourism.\nLooking now at net sales by product category. Fragrance led organic growth, with net sales rising 22% versus prior year. The fragrance category grew double digits across all regions. Luxury fragrances continue to resonate with consumers looking for indulgence, and our brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo were once again star performers.\nNet sales in makeup rose 8% organically driven by the continued recovery and increased usage occasions in Western markets where makeup is generally the largest category. M·A·C and Clinique were top brand performers driven by hero products like M·A·C Studio Fix and the newly launched MACStack mascara as well as Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Continued success and expansion in specialty multi-doors is also aiding category growth.\nHair care net sales grew 5% organically. Excellent performance from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi contributed to growth. The launch of Aveda's vegan hair color in EMEA and a successful activation around the brand's hero and body franchise in Korea also aided category growth.\nNet sales in skin care were the most impacted by the COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting Greater China, Asian travel retail and Korea. Skin care continues to represent approximately 2/3 of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales fell 21% in the quarter due to the disruption of the Shanghai distribution center, with the greatest impact felt by Estée Lauder and La Mer brands. Skin care growth benefited from the addition of DECIEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points.\nOur gross margin declined 370 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by factors affecting our supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and higher costs for both ocean and air transport have increasingly pressured our cost of goods. Unfavorable category mix from softer skin care sales also contributed to the decline.\nOperating expenses decreased 9%, driven by the curtailment of spending this quarter as COVID restrictions sharply reduced store traffic in China, including Hainan. We delivered operating income of $207 million for the quarter compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 included $0.03 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM.\nShifting now to our full year results. Given the volatility experienced throughout the year, the results reflect the benefit derived from the diversification of our top line growth as well as the incredible agility of our teams and their ability to effectively manage costs while also simultaneously investing selectively for future growth.\nNet sales rose 8% organically, with double-digit gains in 3 out of 4 product categories and 2 out of 3 regions. Sales of our products online continued to thrive even as brick-and-mortar recovered, rising 11% for the year and representing 28% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, most channels grew double digit, while department stores ended the year down slightly as pressure from COVID restrictions in Asia offset growth in other regions. And our business in travel retail also grew, ending fiscal 2022 at 27% of sales.\nOur gross margin fell 60 basis points to 75.8%. Favorable pricing and currency were more than offset by higher supply chain costs, which were more pronounced in the back half of the year; the impact of the acquisition of DECIEM; and higher costs for new products and sets. Operating expenses declined 150 basis points to 56% of sales.\nDisciplined expense management and general and administrative costs was the largest contributor to the decline. The changes in our channel mix continue to reduce selling costs, and additionally, we continue to drive more effective resource allocation in our advertising and promotional mix. These favorable trends were partially offset by increased shipping costs.\nDuring the year, we continue to create more flexibility in our cost structure to absorb inflation in wages, media and logistics. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including the Post-COVID Business Acceleration program. This has enabled us to realize greater expense leverage while also reinvesting in areas that support profitable growth, resulting in an overall improvement in our operating margin.\nOur full year operating margin was 19.7%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over last year. This improvement includes the absorption of 60 basis points of dilution from DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.3%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by a lower current year tax benefit associated with share-based compensation and the prior year favorable impact of the U.S. government issuance of final GILTI tax regulations that provided for a retroactive high-tax exception.\nNet earnings rose 11% to $2.6 billion, and diluted EPS increased 12% to $7.24. Earnings per share includes $0.04 accretion from currency translation and $0.05 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration program is wrapping up, with final estimated restructuring charges of $500 million to $515 million, at the top end of our original projections. We are pleased with the progress we achieved from this program.\nWe realigned our brand portfolio by exiting 4 designer fragrance brands as well as the BECCA and RODIN brands, and we are streamlining our market distribution for Smashbox and GLAMGLOW to improve their long-term viability. We optimized our brick-and-mortar distribution network. We have been and will continue to close underproductive freestanding retail stores as we rebalance our distribution network. By the end of fiscal 2023, we expect to have closed nearly 250 freestanding retail stores under the program.\nWe've also rationalized department store counters and other retail locations, improving our ability to focus our efforts on driving more profitable omnichannel opportunities in our remaining distribution. We also approved initiatives to optimize our organization across regions and throughout global functions to reduce complexity, leverage our scale and enhance our go-to-market capabilities.\nWhen we are finished executing the program, we expect a net reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 positions globally. We expect to execute the remaining projects to achieve estimated annualized gross savings of between $390 million and $410 million before taxes beginning in fiscal 2024. A portion of these savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in capabilities that sustain our long-term growth, including data analytics, online and advertising.\nTurning now to our cash flow. We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior year period. The primary driver was higher working capital due to the end of year disruptions related to the pandemic the past few years as well as inventory to support future growth and to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have faced in certain raw material and componentry areas.\nWe utilized $1 billion for capital improvements, an increase of approximately $400 million over last year. We continue to invest in capacity and other supply chain improvements. We increased consumer-facing investments to support in-store experiences and recovery markets. We renovated office space, and we continue to invest in information technology.\nWe also returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace this year as the need for more stringent cash conservation subsided with the progression of the recovery. During the year, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.3 billion, and we paid $840 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase in our dividend rate that became effective in our fiscal second quarter.\nAll in all, we delivered a strong year despite significant disruptions, including continued outbreaks of COVID, higher inflation, supply chain constraints and the invasion in Ukraine, and we also continue to invest in foundational capabilities for the future, including new production capacity and innovation to support growth.\nNow looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we believe that the prestige beauty category has ample opportunities for continued strong growth. Global prestige beauty is expected to grow mid- to high single digits driven by the continued recovery and the gradual reopening of the remaining markets impacted by COVID restrictions. Additionally, we look forward to the continued resumption of international travel, especially in Hainan and the rest of Asia.\nWe are concerned, however, that the recovery this fiscal year will once again not be a smooth one. Record inflation and the threat of recession or slowdown in many markets could temporarily dampen consumer enthusiasm and is causing some retailers to be more cautious regarding inventories. The strengthening dollar is putting pressure on our international earnings. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions could prove to be disruptive.\nWith that backdrop in mind, for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 9%. We discontinued 4 designer fragrance licenses at the end of fiscal 2022. These brands generated $250 million in sales in fiscal 2022. In fiscal '23, we will sell some remaining inventory to the new licensees, primarily in the first half. Sales from both years will be excluded from our organic growth figures.\nAt current levels, currency is projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in fiscal '23 as the U.S. dollar strengthens against key currencies. Based on July 31 spot rates at 1.018 for the euro, 1.215 for the pound, 6.746 for the Chinese yuan and 13.03 for the Korean won, we expect currency translation to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 3 percentage points as well as an additional 1 point due to the impacts of foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets.\nThere are a few other items impacting our sales growth in fiscal 2023. Our list price increases are expected to add approximately 5.5 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary cost pressures. We take most of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. New distribution, including new doors in existing markets, new markets for certain brands and expansion on new online platforms, could add another 2 points.\nConversely, the loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine are expected to trim about 1 percentage point from sales growth. We plan to continue to drive margin expansion through operational efficiencies and cost savings while fueling additional advertising investment where appropriate.\nOur full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.39 and $7.54 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 5% to 7%. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is also expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 6 percentage points.\nAt this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to fall 4% to 6%. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point, and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 3 points. Our first quarter sales are expected to be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan.\nAs you may recall, last year, we mentioned that some of our retailers in North America secured holiday shipments earlier due to supply chain concern, contributing 1.5 points to our growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This year, retailers in the U.S. have been tightening their inventories, causing our net sales to trail retail sale.\nWe expect China and travel retail in APAC to gradually improve throughout the first half of the fiscal year as COVID restrictions lift, and comparisons should ease in the back half of the year as we lap the invasion of Ukraine and the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China.\nWe expect first quarter EPS of $1.22 to $1.32. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 5 percentage points.\nIn closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our strategy to outpace industry growth. Our multiple engines of growth delivered in fiscal 2022, and we anticipate this more diversified growth can continue in the coming year. And importantly, we continue to reinforce the fundamental drivers of our business that both enable and contribute to continued strong future sales and EPS growth.\nI would like to close by extending our heartfelt gratitude to our employees around the globe for continuing to deliver our results during this challenging macro environment.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\n\nLaraine A. Mancini\n\nSVP of IR, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nHello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSince many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nTo facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency, and all organic net sales growth excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nAs a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\n\nFabrizio Freda\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. I want to begin by expressing the great sadness where for our colleagues and all the people impacted by the envision of Ukraine who are experiencing a devastating humanitarian crisis. We continue to focus on our employee safety, and our dearest hope is for peace to prevail.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we delivered organic sales growth of 9%, in line with our guidance despite the acceleration of temporary COVID-19 restriction in China in March. We exercised cost discipline as volatility increased, and our adjusted operating margin expanded, leading to stronger-than-expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 17%.\nOur multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to amplify the engines of the moment amid intensified macro environment, with sales rising organically across both brick-and-mortar and online. Every category grew organically, led by fragrances' outstanding performance. 11 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth and further demonstrated our diversified drivers. Consumer demand remains robust even in this inflationary environment.\nOur largest brands provided highly sought-after, M·A·C, Estée Lauder and Clinique each delivered double-digit growth in makeup, fueling the category renaissance while La Mer thrived in skin care. Four of our scaling brands resonated strongly with consumers as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Aveda and Bobbi Brown each rose double digits. Among our developing brands, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Bumble and bumble each achieved outsized growth and showcased their promise.\nOur sales rose double digit organically in the Americas and EMEA. We capitalize on reopening to translate improving brick-and-mortar traffic trends into outstanding sales growth, owing to our high-touch services, breakthrough innovation, hero franchises and operational excellence.\nOur freestanding stores delivered exceptional performance benefiting from fleet optimization and expanded omnichannel capabilities and complement the strengths in specialty-multi. We are managing the ongoing complexities from the invasion of Ukraine as well as the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, which impacted performance in Asia Pacific in the quarter.\nIn Mainland China, organic sales fell mid-single-digit as 25% growth online was offset by a steep decline in brick-and-mortar. After a strong February, in Mainland China, traffic slowed more sharply in March to pressure brick-and-mortar sales. Additionally, for us, the distribution centers for our Mainland China business are in Shanghai and operated with limited capacity. Tourism to Hainan Island was also curtailed in March after a vibrant start of the quarter. There is no doubt that these current limitations in China will prove to be transitory, although there will be a far greater impact on our results in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter, as Tracey will discuss. Looking ahead, we are confident in the resilience of the Chinese consumers and the untapped opportunity driving our investments in the market. We expect a reacceleration of growth when this moment of COVID abates.\nLet me share the progress we made during the third quarter to drive these strong results and advance our long-term ambitions for our multiple engine of growth strategy. Innovation excelled to reach nearly 30% of sales. We continue to elevate our ability to leverage data analytics with our best-in-class creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends. The breadth of our innovation wins was far-reaching and benefited every category. In skin care, La Mer upgraded The Treatment Lotion sort as the brand doubled down on this coveted East to West product, increasing the skin recharging Miracle Broth and transitioning to a recyclable luxurious glass bottle that contains 20% post-consumer recycled content.\nIn Asia Pacific, consumer gravitated to the new serum strengths and anti-aging benefits, while in the Americas, educating on the benefits of hydration and energy proved impactful with consumers, demonstrating our expertise in serving multiple needs with one product and communicating with the appropriate local relevance.\nFor makeup, M.A.C sought to grow its mascara base, especially across Gen Z, younger millennial and multi-ethnic consumers and created MACStack Mascara. With breakthrough technology that stacks and builds the last look. MACStack went viral on TikTok, having now amassed over 153 million views, and its sales far exceeded our expectations in the quarter.\nTom Ford Beauty new private blend rose fragrances, feature locally relevant nodes, where Rose De Chine feature Chinese golden peony and Rose D’Amalfi includes Italian bergamot. This launch drove exceptional results globally, including China, where the brand had a very successful Valentine's Day.\nLastly, in hair care, Aveda launched botanical retail strengthening overnight serum, disrupting the category by creating our first overnight serum that builds new hair bonds while you sleep. The products sold key consumer pain points with quick-absorbing technology by leveraging a serum-based formula. Encouragingly, the product quickly rose to being the top-selling product in freestanding store and sold out on brand.com.\nWe are excited to build upon this momentum with our new innovation center in Shanghai opens later this calendar year. This important investment in China will significantly increase our ability to serve the Chinese and Asian consumers with locally relevant and inspired innovation. Also, the new center will further enable our East to West innovation mindset, supporting the creation of more successes like La Mer's The Treatment Lotion.\nLooking at our growth engines by category, the strategic decision to pivot our fragrance portfolio to luxury and artisanal is benefit both top line growth and profitability. Fragrances performance in the third quarter was super with sales increasing 31% organically. Impressively, sales exceeded the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal year 2019 by nearly 50% on a reported basis. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, each delivered double-digit sales growth, and Estée Lauder brand complemented these strengths with its well-received new luxury collection. As consumers around the world increasingly express their individuality with scent, these brands are delivering outstanding results, with strong double-digit growth fiscal year-to-date in every region, driven by demand across channels from brick-and-mortar to online and travel retail. There freestanding doors are driving omnichannel experiences, while their online businesses have been transformed during the pandemic.\nAnd this fragrance brands are also contributing to our sustainability goals, with refillable packaging being a compelling element of the value proposition for Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS. We are also thrilled to announce that during the third quarter, Le Labo became B Corp certified, making it the first major fragrance brand and first within our company to receive this certification, indicating a high level of commitment to sustainability and impact.\nTurning to makeup. It was on this call a year ago that we introduced our expectation for makeup renaissance, anticipating it would gradually evolve market by market as social and professional use educations began to resume. We envisioned the category would experience a recovery driven by both restocking as well as a renaissance rooted in a renewed passion for the joy and creativity of makeup after a difficult time.\nEven with the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants, the makeup renaissance has delivered very favorable trends and offers great promise for the future. As usual location expanded in certain markets upon reopening in the third quarter, makeup once again delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the Americas and EMEA. M.A.C and Clinique's makeup sales growth accelerated sequentially, while Estée Lauder and La Mer businesses in the category are already ahead of pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile brands have been meticulous in executing their merchandising and innovation strategy for the renaissance, we invested to create the omni artist with meeting the consumers in innovative ways across brick-and-mortar and online to educate inspire new looks and offer the best in personalized high-touch services.\nM.A.C has been superb in this regard. So, too, has Bobbi Brown with events like live streams from the largest mall in Manchester, England to as per group classes to [domain] in China to one-to-one Zoom sessions in the U.S.\nMoving to hair care, Aveda, Bumble and bumble have reignited growth engines to contribute to the diversified category growth than we expected for fiscal year 2022. Impressively, even as these brands grew sales strong double digits in brick-and-mortar or reopening during the third quarter, they also achieved mid-single-digit online growth.\nLastly, while skin care was pressured by COVID restrictions in the East, the bright spots were still many. In the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies across many long-term growth drivers from luxury to prestige. La Mer performance was extraordinary, with sales rising strong double digits. As I discussed, it upgrades The Treatment Lotion sort creating a high effect on the still new hydrate infused emotion, while its heroes were highly sought after. With desirable innovation and coveted icons, La Mer is welcoming new consumers, earning their trust and traded them up as its ultra Genaissance de la Mer franchise is booming. While our high-end prestige skin care thrives with La Mer and Estée Lauder Re-Nutriv, Bobbi Brown is prospering in the heart of the category, thanks to its strategic focus on treasured heroes like vitamin-enriched face base.\nWe are also laser focused on entry-level prestige to reach new consumers, notably with DECIEM The Ordinary as the brand amplifies its heroes to drive repeat with its ingredient-led regiment-based approach. After the quarter closed, DECIEM announced it will be refining its brand portfolio to focus resources on the compelling opportunity we foresee for The Ordinary and NIOD.\nDuring the quarter, we also improved upon the fundamentals of consumer acquisitions, engagement and high-touch services, positioning us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. Our partnership with TikTok expanded, and we are piloting new innovations on the platform to be at the forefront of social commerce innovations. In the U.S., several of our brands launched storefronts on TikTok, similarly linking to brand.com. Brands also expanded their capabilities with Instagram Shopping and launched category powered lenses on Snapchat similarly linked to brand.com. Clinique realized favorable engagement trends on TikTok and Instagram, and it featured its back in stock coveted Black Honey lipstick and strong recruitment growth with new advertising for Moisture Surgood evening 100 hour featuring the need for social phase of adventure campaign.\nThe Estée Lauder brand entered the metaverse as connecting with our consumer wherever they are is paramount, and we are excited to be testing and learning in this new ecosystem. Estée Lauder was the exclusive beauty brand partner of Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week, the first ever large virtual fashion week in an unchanged metaverse.\nAround the world, our brands are increasingly leveraging new campaign management tools to tailor communication and drive repeat to both reengage with consumers and foster relationships with new consumers. We are realizing increased reactivation and repeat purchase rate from the U.K. to France, Australia and beyond.\nIn closing, we delivered very strong performance amid the accelerating headwinds during the third quarter. We also made excellent progress advancing the long-term drivers of our multiple engine of growth strategy. These results in this progress are due to the tremendous accomplishments of our employees around the world to whom I extend my deepest thanks as they continue to manage complex situation with grace and ingenuity.\nMoreover, I'm incredibly inspired by our employees' compassion for each other. Last week marked the 2-year anniversary of the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund. The fund was created in response to employee increasing desire to support one another in times of need. Since inception, over $10 million has been distributed to employees globally from donations and company matches.\nLooking ahead, while we are lowering our expectation for the fourth quarter, given the impact of the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, we expect to deliver another record year in fiscal year 2022. We remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our business. This quarter proved the vibrancy of prestige beauty, its resiliency even in a difficult macro environment and the strength of our trusted brands and product innovations as markets sequentially recover from the prolonged pandemic.\nI will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter net sales grew 9% organically despite the increased complexity and volatility caused by the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was broad-based across categories and markets as most regions across the world continue to recover and grow, albeit at different rates.\nSales in specialty-multi and freestanding retail stores led growth and online sales rose mid-single-digits. The inclusion of sales from the late May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 2 points to reported net sales growth, and currency was a headwind of approximately 1 point.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18%. Growth was realized across most markets, channels and brands. Market growth was led by both the recovery in the largest Western markets as well as in key emerging markets like Turkey and India. All brick-and-mortar channels grew, led by double-digit growth in department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi stores. Organic sales online declined when compared to the prior year quarter where online sales benefited both from the pandemic-driven store closures and reduced store traffic. All product categories and most brands grew in the region, led by La Mer, Jo Malone London and M.A.C.\nOur global travel retail business again grew double digits despite the challenges that arose during the quarter. Asia is the largest region for our travel retail business, and sales in the key markets of China and Korea were very robust at retail for most of the quarter. However, there was a precipitous decline in Chinese travel in March as restrictions to contain COVID were increased in China. We continue to see a sharp increase in travel retail sales outside of Asia as traffic increased throughout Europe and the Americas.\nNet sales in the Americas rose 11% organically, with all markets contributing to growth. All product categories grew with particular strength in makeup and hair care. The 2 largest prestige makeup brands in the U.S., M.A.C and Clinique, outpaced overall category growth to gain share. Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford Beauty also gained share helping to further drive the makeup renaissance as more consumers continued their return to the workplace and resumed more social occasions.\nOur sales in specialty-multi and in freestanding retail stores strongly outperformed this quarter as consumers return to stores for shopping and services. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth, and favorable currency movement contributed 1 point to sales growth in the region.\nIn our Asia Pacific region, organic net sales fell 4%, driven entirely by Greater China. For the quarter, net sales in Mainland China declined mid-single-digits. Following a strong Lunar New Year in February, sales declined in March as additional COVID restrictions impacted many cities, most notably Shanghai, where our distribution centers serving the entire country are located. The restriction sharply curtailed productivity at these facilities, affecting our ability to both receive product being shipped into the country and to fulfill demand across all channels of distribution. However, shipments should begin to normalize as restrictions ease.\nNet sales in Hong Kong also declined throughout the quarter as the city took increasing measures to contain the virus. Partially offsetting these decreases with strong net sales growth in most other markets, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Online sales in Asia Pacific grew strong double digits as we continue to expand our brand reach across new platforms.\nOur gross margin improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic price increases of approximately 4% combined with favorable currency and reduced obsolescence contributed to the increase in gross margin as well as the favorable impact of anniversary last year's under absorption of manufacturing overhead. This more than offset the impact of increased inflationary pressures in our supply chain, mainly in logistics and materials and increasing start-up costs for our new plant in Japan.\nOperating expenses decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of general and administrative expense was partially offset by increased shipping costs related to higher freight rates and more air shipments on increased sales volume. Additionally, as cities throughout China began tightening restrictions and traffic to Hainan slowed, we reduced certain expenses to correspond with slower retail traffic.\nOperating income rose 15% to $917 million, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.6% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.90 increased 17% compared to the prior year.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded $216 million of impairment to goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to Dr. Jart+, reflecting forecast for slower-than-expected growth in China and travel retail. We continue to believe in the growth potential of the brand, which has been impacted by the temporary COVID disruptions in Asia given its strong growth prior to the start of the pandemic as well as the growth seen in recovering markets.\nFor the 9 months, we generated $1.97 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2.78 billion last year, which reflects investments in working capital to both support growth and mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruptions as well as higher cash paid for taxes. This was partially offset by higher net income. We significantly increased our capital investment to $658 million to support the ongoing construction of our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. Investments in our innovation center in Shanghai as well as investments in online and technology enhancements. And we returned $2.62 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nTurning now to our outlook. As you have heard and are aware, there have been 2 significant headwinds that have emerged since we last gave guidance in early February, increased COVID-related restrictions in China also impacting Hainan and the invasion of Ukraine. Our current guidance for the balance of this year reflects continued momentum in the Americas and EMEA excluding travel retail as well as the continuation of lockdowns and corresponding distribution constraints in China through at least the first half of our fourth quarter. While we expect continued growth at retail in both Mainland China and Hainan, the severity of the distribution constraints we are experiencing are expected to result in a meaningful decline in net sales for these areas for the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to fulfill the majority of our orders in time for our planned 6.18 activities. The elimination of sales in Russia and Ukraine has reduced expected fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 120 basis points.\nAt the same time, we delivered outstanding results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, with greater diversification of our growth drivers. Our geographic diversity is a tremendous asset, and we expect our multiple engines of growth to continue, including the ongoing recovery of the Americas, Western Europe and most markets in Asia. We expect to also deliver strong margin improvement for the year. The benefit of our strategic pricing actions this year, along with agility and our cost management are helping to offset the initial effects of increasing inflation throughout this fiscal year. We plan to continue to invest in the recovery, support innovation and assuming current disruptions abate, fuel upcoming key shopping moments in the quarter, like 6.18 in China and Mother's Day.\nWith these assumptions as our backdrop for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are now forecasted to grow 5% to 7%. This range excludes approximately 2 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.05 and $7.15 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. These expectations imply margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points, including dilution of 40 basis points from DECIEM this year.\nIn closing, we managed extremely well through an increasingly complex environment in our third quarter, and these complexities are expected to meaningfully impact our fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to expect to deliver a very strong year with above-average organic top line growth, excellent margin expansion and solid EPS growth. We are confident that we can continue to manage through the present temporary headwinds and be well prepared for accelerated momentum when the pandemic effects ease.\nAnd that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

    "content": "Q1 2022 EssilorLuxottica SA Corporate Sales Call\n\nQ1 2022 EssilorLuxottica SA Corporate Sales Call\n\nELPARISAPR 22, 4:30 AM\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the EssilorLuxottica Q1 revenue 2022.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI now hand the call over to Stefano Grassi, CFO.\n\nStefano Grassi\n\nCo-CFO, EssilorLuxottica Société anonyme\n\nGood morning and welcome to our first quarter trading update.\nWe are very pleased with the way we started 2022 despite some headwinds, like the COVID outbreak that hit several parts of the world and also the dramatic events related to the war in Ukraine, but Q1 has been a quarter of strong growth for the group, a quarter where our top line was up 38% on a reported basis, while on a pro forma basis, we're looking at the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with sales up 11.5% at constant currency and 15.7% at current exchange rate.\nThe key assets of the EssilorLuxottica group are in healthy shape. All the region posted solid growth in Q1, with EMEA and Latin America at double-digit pace, while North America was up 8% on top of a 6% in 2021 versus 2019 on a pro forma basis. Our key eyewear brand, Oakley and Ray-Ban, they both posted double-digit growth in Q1. Our vision care assets that represent more than 75% of our revenue base grew in excess of 9% at constant currency, thanks to a demand that continues to be strong pretty much in all the regions around the world. Last but not least, our sun business is back again with double-digit growth very much led by our luxury portfolio, but before we start the journey around the different geographies, let me give you just a quick flavor on how we did perform in our 2 operating segments.\nThe Professional Solutions division posted top line slightly south of double-digit pace at 9.6% at constant currency, in acceleration versus the fourth quarter trend at 6.8%, with North America on a high single-digit territory and both EMEA and Latin America at double-digit pace. Our Direct to Consumer segment continued its outstanding performance, posting the fourth consecutive quarter on a pro forma basis a double-digit pace at 13.5% versus Q1 2021. Our brick-and-mortar comps were up double digit. Our e-commerce business was up 9% versus 2021 and up over 80% versus 2019 level, proving once again that our multichannel-oriented strategy is definitely going into the right direction, but now let's start our journey around the different geography. And on Page 12, as usual, let's start with North America.\nNorth America posted a growth in top line at about 8% at constant currency. The demand in the market is still there, probably a bit softer in the month of January due to the spread of COVID cases around North America. In the Professional Solutions side, the overall growth in the quarter was on the high single-digit territory for the frame business with double-digit pace in key accounts, double digit in e-commerce partner, double digit in the sport channel, with a strong support from the sun business that was up, again, double digit, thanks to a luxury brand portfolio support. On the lens side of the business, our branded portfolio reported solid growth in Q1 also supported by the new transition XTRActive and by Varilux that during Q1 posted a top line up on the mid-single-digit territory.\nMoving on to retail. The overall comps were at the low single digit, with Sunglass Hut that performed in mid-single-digit territory led by our international store location as the U.S. border reopened to international tourists during the latter part of the fourth quarter, while LensCrafters were actually on the low single-digit territory with a soft start in January due to the Omicron cases and a tougher comparison base during the last 2 to 3 weeks of March as we anniversaried the stimulus pack in the U.S. and a strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign in Q1 2021. And let's touch on e-commerce: Our e-commerce business was south of double digit with our 3 key branded eyewear website, Oakley.com, SunglassHut.com and Ray-Ban.com, that all posted double-digit growth during the course of Q1, but now let's move to EMEA.\nEMEA posted a remarkable acceleration in the top line. On a pro forma basis, EMEA posted a first half of 2021 negative 1%. In the second half of the year last year, we were up 8.5% versus 2019. And now in the first quarter 2021 (sic) [2022], our top line grew 18%, with both Professional Solutions and Direct to Consumer at a double-digit pace. On the Professional Solutions side, Spain, Germany, U.K., Eastern Europe and Turkey, they all delivered double-digit growth also helped by a favorable comparable base, while Italy and France were, respectively, flat and a low single digit during the course of Q1.\nOur branded lens portfolio grew at mid-single digits driven by price/mix, with Eyezen, Varilux and transition very much leading the way in Q1. On the frames side, we posted double-digit growth led by a strengthened business even in Europe and by a strong delivery of both our Ray-Ban and our Oakley brand.\nIf we now move to retail for a second. Comps were in excess of 25% compared to the first quarter 2021. Clearly the COVID restrictions that you remember applied last year in Europe created some easy base of comparison that more than offset, I would say, the headwinds deriving from the uncertainty of the war in Ukraine. In Europe, all our main banners Générale d'Optique, GrandOptical, Apollo, Salmoiraghi & Viganò and Sunglass Hut, they all posted double-digit growth mainly driven by volume, with price/mix as a nice add-on.\nMoving to Asia Pac now, top line up 3% at constant currency. In Asia, we posted the best performance during the last 5 quarters on a pro forma basis. Southeast Asia and Japan, they were all double digits, while our performance in Greater China was flat, with professional solution in mid-single digits with strong delivery of the Stellest lenses that, during the course of the first quarter, sold more than half of the Stellest lenses that we sold in the entire 2021 in China. And this remarkable delivery happened despite the severe consequences of COVID-related restrictions that impacted Hong Kong as well as Mainland China. And just to give you an idea: In Hong Kong, over 95% of our store base in the month of March were impacted by either closure or severe traffic decline due to local restriction for COVID. That number, it's 75% in Mainland China, so materially impact in our -- disruption, I would say, due to the COVID restriction in China.\nIn Australian retail, we had a strong rebound in Sunglass Hut, thanks to a reopen up to tourists with Australians that now can move around the different states, while our OPSM business, our optical retail business in Australia, decelerated in a negative territory due to a soft January due to the COVID cases buildup in the month of March that was impacted by severe floods, but we have confidence that during the course of the second quarter things will progressively improve.\nThe last region for today is Latin America. And it's actually the best performer of all the region, 21% in top line growth at constant currency. Both Professional Solutions and Direct to Consumer posted double-digit growth, with Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, all of them, at double-digit pace. In Brazil that, as you well know, is our largest country, we grew close to 20% in our B2B channel with lenses that were up on a high single digit with our branded lens portfolio that posted a double-digit growth and our frame business that was up in excess of 30% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Now let's touch on retail, where our comp sales were double digits on both optical and sun retail chain with double digit in GMO and the growth that for all the main GrandVision chain in the region were double digits, but now we finish our journey around the different geography.\nAnd let's move to our Q&A session."

Today, we are proud to share with you EssilorLuxottica's results for 2021, an extraordinary year in which we achieved a lot. We succeeded not only from a financial perspective, but we also completed some of the most strategic projects over the last few years that will shape the future of the company and all the industry for the years to come.\nDespite a still challenging environment, EssilorLuxottica embarked on a remarkable recovery journey in 2021. We growing sales and profits compared to pre-pandemic levels. The company met the guidance on sales and bit is twice upgraded targets on the operating margin. North America was the key driver, thanks to our excellent execution in both professional solution and the direct-to-consumer segment.\nOn top of that, all the other regions accelerated in the fourth quarter, closing the year on a positive note. Our ability to translate the business growth into operating margin expansion drove up our profit and generate an all-time record amount of cash flow. Stefano will further elaborate on all these trends later.\nIf we look beyond the pure financial results, 2021 was also an outstanding year in terms of transformation. With the interim period now behind us, we kicked off the next stage of integration, company structure were merged leaders for each of the business segment worldwide were appointed. This has given way to an experienced and talented top management team able to fulfill and execute our vision.

We are now a EUR 21.5 billion company, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.1% and net profit of EUR 2.3 billion. A dream has come through.\nOn the product side, we brought to the market yet another groundbreaking innovation. Ray-Ban Stories, the next generation of smart glasses, in partnership with (inaudible) and roll it out to new markets, Stellest, our lens innovation that slow the progression of myopia.\nThe group is at the start of the new year.

Why we continue to compete in our market, we also keep building a network connecting to many other players to share with all the best we have and accomplish our mission of promoting good vision everywhere.\nAt the same time, we delivered strong results to our shareholders and stakeholders.

The improved ECG ranking of the group reflects all the hard work done so far. And Paul will tell you more about our initiatives as a key pillar of our identity.\nLast, we are updating our long-term guidance for the next 5 years until 2026 we are targeting to achieve mid-single-digit annual revenue growth and adjusted operating margin in the range of 19% to 20% at the end of the period.\nAnd with that, I leave the floor to Stefano and Paul.\n\nAriel Bauer\n\nCo-Head of IR, EssilorLuxottica Société anonyme\n\nThank you, Francesco and good morning, everybody. As you remarked, 2021 has been an outstanding year for EssilorLuxottica, and the results on this page very much confirm that.\nOn the upper part of the slide, you have a summary of our 2021 results, including the impact of GrandVision. While at the bottom of the page, you have the results reported, excluding the impact of GrandVision.\nOn a full year basis, our top line grew on a high single-digit territory at constant currency with a strong acceleration in the fourth quarter, where our top line accelerated in a double-digit pace 11% on a pro forma basis, including GrandVision; 11.8%, excluding the impact of GrandVision -- actually, Q4 has been the best quarter for the group with and without the impact of GrandVision.\nLast comment on our operating profit, where you can see that we accounted for a marginal dilution of approximately 90 basis points by including GrandVision into the EssilorLuxottica results.\nAnd therefore, on a pro forma basis, we're looking at an adjusted operating profit at 16.1% for the full year 2021.\nBut now let's look at our results for 2021 comparing those results with the target provided at the beginning of the year in March and upgraded twice throughout the year.\nOn a full year basis, we guided for a top line growth, mid- to high single digits and we actually delivered 8% growth rate for the full year 2021. From a profitability standpoint. We actually guided for an adjusted operating profit versus 2019 as a percentage of revenue, that would improve up to 100 basis points. We actually delivered 130 basis points of margin improvement compared to 2019. Therefore, our 2 KPIs were either fully met or exceeded for our target with respect to 2021.\nBut now let's leave behind 2021, and let's look at future and a bright future for EssilorLuxottica and share with you and revised long-term outlook for the group. An outlook that is a story of top line growth as well as margin expansion.\nAnd you can see here that our top line growth expectation for the period 2022 to 2026 is to grow our sales in a mid-single-digit territory. From a profitability standpoint, we have an expectation of an adjusted operating profit to land at between 19% to 20% by year 2026. And just to qualify a little bit more our outlook for the period, I want to share with you that the figures provided today are at constant currency. We included bolt-on acquisition as part of our top line growth and from a profitability standpoint, our operating profit is fully loaded with synergies as well as investment activities that the group will undertake during the next 5 years.\nBut now let's start looking at a little bit closely, our 2 different segments before we start our journey across the 4 regions.\nIn the Page 8 of the presentation, you have the fourth quarter results for Professional Solutions and Direct-to-consumer You can clearly see the Professional Solutions segment reported a top line growth of approximately 7% at constant currency, with EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific, around mid-single-digit territory, while Latin America posted a double-digit growth during Q4.\nFrom a channel mix standpoint, our growth was very much driven by key accounts, online partners and by a tighter relationship with our ECPs around the world, thanks to specific programs like EL 360. We are now deploying in different parts of the world. On the direct-to-consumer side, very pleased to see our brick-and-mortar division on a double-digit pace while our e-commerce grew in excess of 60% during the course of the fourth quarter with all the 4 regions at double-digit pace. But now let's start our journey across the different region, beginning as usual and Page 11 for the biggest one, North America.\nIn North America, we posted another outstanding quarter in top line growth. 14% was our growth, very much in line with what we've seen during the course of the third quarter. with both Professional Solution in mid-single digit; and our Direct-to-consumer at the double-digit pace.\nIf we look at closely at our Professional Solutions performance during the course of the fourth quarter, we're very pleased to report the Ray-Ban and the Oakley brand,delivered double-digit growth, while our branded lens portfolio grew on a mid-single-digit territory with Transition, (inaudible) and (inaudible) all delivered positive growth during Q4.\nIf we now move to the direct-to-consumer segment, our brick-and-mortar part was up double digit. LensCrafters and Target Optica were high single, very much supported by a strong lens mix. We are pleased to report that Sunglass Hut posted the third consecutive quarter at double-digit comps finally supported by international location as the U.S. board reopened to the international tourist.\nLast touch on e-commerce. E-commerce was up 75% versus 2019 after a strong holiday season with Oakley, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, EyeBuyDirect that all doubled the size of the business during the course of the fourth quarter.\nBut now let's move to Europe and very, very happy with the 8% top line growth on the fourth quarter, again, another performance in continuation with the delivery that we've seen in Q3.\nIn the Professional Solutions side of Europe, Italy, Scandinavia, Turkey, Eastern Europe, they were all up double digits. United Kingdom was up on the mid-single-digit territory at France, that was slightly negative, very much due to a deceleration that we experienced in our frame business. While our Lens business was actually up on the high single-digit territory for Q4.\nFrom a channel mix standpoint, our growth was strongly driven by key accounts, buying group, ECP, while our Travel Retail business was in a negative territory due to the restriction that we still experience due to the COVID.\nMoving to our retail brick-and-mortar now. Very pleased to see top line accelerating close to the double-digit pace after the first 9 months of the year, we were flat on a pro forma basis. Salmoiraghi & Viganò, our optical retail chain in Italy, performed on a double-digit pace with October, November and December, all on the double-digit territory.\nThe U.K. business of GrandVision posted a top line growth, up 20% during Q4.\nAnd finally, Sunglass Hut delivered comp in the positive territory for the last quarter of the year.\nBut now let's turn to move East. Let's touch on Asia Pacific, where we're very pleased to see our top line on a positive territory on constant currency after 2 consecutive quarters of sales decline. Our growth in the region was very much driven by the Professional Solutions segment, where our Direct-to-consumer segment was slightly negative.\nIn Professional Solutions, our 2 key countries India and China delivered both double-digit growth. In particular, in China, we sold approximately 350,000 pairs of standard lenses, and standard lenses today represent approximately 50% of of the revenue growth in our lens business.\nIn the fourth quarter, we also experienced strong delivery of our frame business, also thanks to a strong double-digit pace of our Bolon brand in China.\nIf we now move to direct to consumer, I want to begin from the Australian retail business. You remember that Australia softer a stronger lockdown and restriction during Q3 and the earliest part of the fourth quarter. And as we exited from the fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter from the restriction, we actually experienced an acceleration and restart at a strong pace of our business. Oakley (inaudible), our leading retail chain in Australia, delivered a double-digit comps in Q4 and very much reassuring the demand in the market is still there.\nWhile conversely, if we look at China, we're still in a negative territory due to localized lockdowns that impact the Mainland China as well as Hong Kong.\nAnd now let's complete our journey around the different geographies with the last one in line, Latin America We see and observe in Latin America, a very different pave between the first half of the year, where our top line was up 1.6% versus 2019, still on a pro forma basis in the second half of the year where we delivered plus 18% top line growth with the fourth quarter in further acceleration at plus 25%, with both segments, Direct-to-consumer and Professional Solutions on a double-digit pace.\nOn the Professional Solutions side in Brazil, the biggest country, we posted a strong growth on the prescription business, both lenses and frames, with our ECP, which accounts for about 50% of our business that very much led the growth in the country.\nIn Brazil, we also experienced a successful pilot of the EL 360 program, where we had at the end of 2021, about 1,000 doors were rolled into the program, and there will be more in 2022 as we're going to go on a larger scale in Brazil with this initiative.\nWith respect to the other geography, Mexico was up on the high single digit, thanks to independent channel as well as department stores. Argentina was up triple digit, thanks to a strong price mix, but also supported by volume.\nIf we move now to the Direct-to-Consumer segment. Our GMO was up double digit, thanks to a strong lens mix and volume growth. And last but not least, our Sunglass Hut business in the region that posted double-digit comps in (inaudible) as well as in Mexico and high single-digit growth rate in the Brazilian Sunglass Hut business.\nBut now let me close our chapter on financials, and let me close with cash. In 2021, the group delivered EUR 2.8 billion of free cash flow generation approximately EUR 1 billion more than the free cash flow that we generated in 2018 a and in 2020. And that, despite the currency headwinds that we experienced in 2021 and that despite the higher capital investment profile that we had this year with a CapEx they were slightly over EUR 1 billion for the full year.\nExcluding the impact of (inaudible), our free cash flow generation will be approximately EUR 800 million higher than the 1 they recorded in the last 2 years. So very pleased to get into 2022 with a very strong balance sheet position.\nBut now let me hand it over to Paul who will walk us through our support to the EssilorLuxottica mission.\n\nPaul du Saillant\n\nDeputy CEO & Director, EssilorLuxottica Société anonyme\n\nthank you, Stefano, and good morning to you all. You have just heard from Francesco and Stefano about all the great things we have accomplished and the strength of our performance in 2021. I believe it was made possible, thanks to 3 things: first, the incredible passion and engagement of our 180,000 people around the world; second, continued trust of our customers and consumers. And third, our commitment to our mission and sustainability, which are strongly intertwine with our business strategy at Essilor Luxottica.\nSustainability has always been deeply rooted in both funding companies. So one of the first things we did in the construction of EssilorLuxottica as one company but to embed sustainability at the core through our eyes on the planet program.\nSince launching it in July last year, we have made good progress in each of the 5 key pillars. On the first pillar, as on carbon, we announced today that we have become carbon neutral across our direct operation in France and Italy, our 2 historic home countries. This is an important milestone on our journey to reducing and neutralizing the carbon footprint of our direct operation worldwide by 2025. Starting with Europe from 2023. We did this through a constant monitoring of our energy consumption and investments in renewable energy with a focus on safe production close to our facilities.\nResidual emissions are compensated by 2 important reforestation projects, 1 in Italy near our site in Agordo; and the other one in the rural region of Lyon in China.\nIn addition to protecting and restoring natural ecosystem, this project supports the well-being of local community.\nThe second pillar is on circularity, aims to reduce our impact on the planet through the 4 R approach: Research, reduce, reuse, recycle.\nIn particular, we are stepping up our investments to create circular products from the very start of the innovation process using EcoDesign principle. A great example in the -- is the collaboration with (inaudible) with the joint production of more sustainable asset date to be used in the production of frames.\nFocusing on waste by directing our effort on reducing waste generation and valorizing it with circular closed groups.\nAnother initiative is the recent partnership with the SEC Business School, outside of Paris, joining L'Oreal and Bouygues to launch the first international chair devoted to the secular economy.\nAs we build a sustainable future for all, last year, we made a lot of progress on our journey towards eliminating provisions by 2050 in line with our mission. This is what the third pillar, eyes on World site is about.\nDespite the ongoing challenges linked to COVID, we provided 50 million people in developing communities with access to Vision Care, thanks to our inclusive business and financial efforts.\nIn total, we created 7 million new (inaudible) in 2021. We also trained more than 1,600 new Vision Care entrepreneur in that year, providing them with a lively route.\nIn addition, at tier site, successfully opened 18 vision centers in China, Liberia and Zambia.\nAs we are building one company, we are also working on consolidating all our philanthropic and advocacy actions globally. The fourth pillar is on ethics is at the heart of everything we do. Our vertically integrated model makes us quite unique as it gives us full visibility for our whole business from raw materials to end consumer.\nAs a result, a greater control of our standards. For instance, in 2021, we continue to leverage, unified and extend our suppliers sustainability standards and initiative, ensuring the (inaudible) our commitments in the area of FX, labor, health, safety and environment.\nAnd finally, eye on inclusion, the fifth pillar. EssilorLuxottica is a diverse and inclusive company by nature as we are the combination of Essilor, Luxottica and now GrandVision. We want to provide our community of over 180,000 talented people of every nationality, gender, age an ability with an environment in which everyone can thrive, feel valued and respected and constantly learn. This commitment extends to the communities in which we operate, eye care professionals, customers and suppliers, a tangible, practical advancement in this respect has been the launch of Leonardo, our innovative learning platform open to employees, but also to the Vision Care industry as a whole. offering a wide selection of state-of-the-art content in or already 15 languages.\nIn recognition, our efforts around diversity and inclusion in recent years. We recently earned the spot on the Financial Times Diversity Leaders list. We are determined to continue to develop in this area. Our International Women's Day, like any day of the we honor and celebrate the strength, intelligence, arts and tenacity of our women colleagues and all women around the world, even more so in the difficult moments we are living. We are honored to have some great women leaders at the helm of some key geographies and function, like, for example, Crystal Barranger leading wholesale in EMEA, one of the 2 largest regions of the group.\nLast but not least, our employee shareholding is another key way for us to promote inclusion as it fosters a sense of belonging and ownership among employees. It has been present in our culture for decades.\nFollowing the success of our latest employee shareholding plan in 2021, 67,000 of the group's employees in 85 countries now hold a financial stake in the company. You can see sustainability is at the heart of the construction of EssilorLuxottica, part of our new culture and fully embraced by our teams.\nI hope that what we have shared with you this morning gives you a sense of the momentum that is carrying us forward.\nAnd with that, I would like to hand over to the operator for the Q&A. Thank you very much."

It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engines of growth strategy showcased the benefit of its diversification. Every category, region and major channel expanded. We size the favorable dynamics of skin care, fragrance developed markets in the West, brick-and-mortar, and continue to prosper in the East with Chinese consumer as well as in global travel retail and global online.\nThe flexibility we built into our business model over the last decade enable us to both allocate resources to attractive growth opportunities and effectively manage the impacts by increasing inflationary environment. Our advanced planning for the key shopping moments of 11.11 and holidays allowed us to overcome supply chain obstacles.\nFor our second quarter, reported net sales grew 14%. Organic net sales rose 11%. Adjusted operating margin expanded, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15%. Today's results are all the more impressive compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when we delivered record organic sales growth in our seasonally largest quarter.\nDespite the ensuing challenges of COVID-19, which escalated during the quarter with Omicron, we far exceeded the exceptional results of 2 years ago. Reported sales are 20% higher, driven by organic sales growth and with every region now larger, and we are much more profitable. Our gains during the last 2 years reinforced our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. Moreover, our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow remains incredibly strong, owing to the timeless desirability of our brands and our commitment during the pandemic to invest for the near and the long term.\nOur brand portfolio of large, scaling and developing brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth as consumer reward the quality of our trusted brand and hero products. In the second quarter, 11 brands achieved double-digit organic sales growth versus the prior year period. This broad-based trend is similar to the contribution in the first quarter despite a far tougher comparison.\nThe momentum in our largest brands, Clinique, Estée Lauder, La Mer and M·A·C, continues as the hero franchises capitalize on innovation in product engagement and high-touch experiences and services to drive trial and repeat.

The brand excelled in every region and across major channels, cheered by its loyal consumer and embraced by new cohort of consumers, including more men.\nClinique's skin care portfolio with its desirable innovation and hero franchises performed strongly.

Clinique Take The Day Off makeup remover saw a dramatic uptick in sales, evidence of makeup's emerging renaissance and the staying power of this crowd-favorite skin care product, which is recruiting a new generation of consumers.\nFor makeup, the Estée Lauder brand is a driving force in the category emerging renaissance, with makeup sales for the brand already larger than 2 years ago. Estée Lauder Double Wear hero franchise delivered remarkable performance, while its Futurist foundation, which is an East to West product born of skinification of makeup trend, was very strong.\nOur fragrance portfolio continued to go from strength to strength, owing to the enduring sand-based ritual created in the pandemic and enhanced by innovation, better online storytelling and expanded reach as consumers in the East embrace this category.

The center is designed to enable end-to-end innovation from concept, from product packaging through development, scale-up and commercialization.\nI am pleased to share that the build-out of our state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo is also progressing very well, which is a testament to the amazing work of our global supply chain team amid the pandemic. Its first phase is complete, and we are on track to start limited production by the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nOur growth engines further diversified by channel as both online and brick-and-mortar prospered.

Indeed, in North America, La Mer generated the most sales from a live stream to date in the quarter.\nOur brands are innovating in social commerce on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and WeChat, among others.

And Tom Ford Beauty creatively debuted its new flagship site on WeChat's mini program in China. Embedded with these outstanding results across categories, regions and channels is the progress we are making in social impact and sustainability.\nSince we spoke with you in November, we are pleased to have received several external recognition of our ESG efforts.

And for the fifth year in a row, we were named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.

This approach can be adopted, built upon and scaled by others across our industry to further advance sustainability.\nEstée Lauder is launching an all-new Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer created with innovations in formula and ingredients in a new recyclable glass jar. Smashbox is introducing Photo Finish Silkscreen Primer collection featuring vegan formulas with a skin-defending complex and instant makeup benefits. Lastly, DECIEM vegan brands, The Ordinary, is welcoming back Salicylic Acid 2% Solution, boosting a win list of over 400,000 for the new formula.\nIn closing, we delivered outstanding performance amid the accelerated volatility and variability as well as supply chain challenges of the pandemic. This demonstrates that we have the competency to navigate complexity well. Our commitment to invest for the long term is of great importance in this moment as we benefit from the advancement we have made over the last few years in data analytics, technology, R&D and supply chain. These announced capabilities, combined with our strong portfolio of desirable brands, exceptional talent and more flexible resource allocation, are enabling us to realize the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy even in a difficult external environment.\nThe grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employee in this still-challenging moment knows no bounds. They are the embodiment of our company's strong culture. And to them, I extend my deepest gratitude.\nI will now turn the call over to Tracey.\n\nTracey Thomas Travis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\n\nThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As you just heard, our momentum continued in our second quarter, with net sales growing 11% organically and 14% in total, led by a continued overall progression and recovery despite the volatility inherent across markets with a prolonged pandemic. We had a solid holiday performance across all of our regions. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 3 points to reported net sales growth, and the currency impact was neutral.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas rose 19% as holiday shoppers return to brick-and-mortar retail where we had an exciting array of gifting products and holiday activations in store. And even with more consumer shopping in stores, organic sales online also grew solidly in the Americas, with online representing more than 1/3 of sales in the region. Every market in the region contributed to sales growth this quarter, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 5 points to the total reported sales growth in the region.\nIn our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 13%. Growth was diverse and broad-based, with global travel retail as well as every market contributing. All channels grew, led by double-digit growth across brick-and-mortar as recovery continued in both developed and emerging markets in the region.\nDespite a strong performance during key shopping moments, organic sales online declined slightly, primarily driven by the U.K. due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which was more severely impacted by brick-and-mortar lockdowns. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 3 points to total reported sales growth in the region.\nOur global travel retail business grew low double digits. Travel restrictions have eased globally, and international passenger traffic continued to progressively improve, resulting in some stores reopening during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Travel retail continues to be led by Asia/Pacific where demand from Chinese consumers remain strong.\nIn our Asia/Pacific region, organic net sales rose 5%. Most of the markets in the region grew, led by Mainland China and Australia, although we continue to see variability in COVID restrictions and retail traffic across markets. Sales grew across most major channels in the region, especially online, which benefited from the recent launch of 3 brands on JD.com. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 1 point to total reported sales growth in the region.\nFrom a category standpoint, organic net sales of fragrances grew 30% with double-digit increases across all regions. Exceptional double-digit increases from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS reflected strong performances from hero products, new product launches and the continued growth of the Bath & Body and Home subcategories.\nOrganic net sales in makeup rose 12% as consumers in the Americas and Europe responded to social media activations, holiday assortments and trends. Estée Lauder foundations continue to resonate very strongly with consumers, especially those in the Double Wear and Futurist franchises. M·A·C continued to drive the makeup renaissance with engaging, interactive campaigns throughout the quarter, like the special M·A·C trend Halloween report and solid holiday collections. Too Faced, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in the category this quarter.\nOrganic net sales in skin care grew 7%, reflecting double-digit increases from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 4 percentage points to reported growth. Our organic net sales in hair care rose 18% as traffic in salons and stores improved, primarily in the Americas. Aveda's growth came mostly from holiday gifts and hero franchises and in online and freestanding stores, while Bumble and bumble focused on recruiting new consumers in the specialty-multi channel.\nOur gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to last year. The benefits of strategic price increases and favorable currency more than offset the impact of higher makeup mix and lower gross margin on DECIEM products. Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter.\nOperating expenses decreased 140 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of selling expense and general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases in advertising and shipping costs, the latter due to both inflation and our direct-to-consumer online growth.\nOperating income rose 22% to $1.44 billion, and our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 25.9% in the quarter. Our tax rate at 21.4% continued at a more normal level this year versus the prior year, which was impacted by a onetime benefit associated with GILTI.\nDiluted EPS of $3.01 increased 15% compared to the prior year. For the 6 months, we generated $1.85 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.98 billion last year, which reflects both a return to more normalized working capital needs as well as increased inventory to mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruption given the ongoing global macro challenges.\nWe significantly increased our capital investment to $459 million to support the construction of our new production facility near Tokyo as well as investments in our online business and other technology enhancements. And we returned $1.84 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, with an increase in our dividend rate occurring in the second quarter.\nSo turning now to our outlook. We delivered an exceptional first half characterized by strong and diversified double-digit organic sales growth and disciplined cost management in the context of intermittent COVID disruptions, including the rise of the Omicron variant, high inflation and volatility. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance to reflect our expectation for a strong year despite the potential further spread of Omicron, supply chain challenges and increased inflationary pressures.\nInflation and transportation and procurement is expected to impact our cost of goods in the second half. However, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts for the fiscal year. At this time, we expect pricing to add approximately 3.5 points of growth with the inclusion of the additional pricing actions we are taking during our second half.\nWe are planning to support the continuation of the recovery with increased point-of-sale staffing as retail traffic continues to gradually improve. We are also planning to support key hero franchise launches in our third quarter from Estée Lauder, La Mer and Origins with increased marketing and advertising support. This investment will increase cost towards the latter part of the third quarter with more of the benefit to be realized in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 10% to 13%. Based on rates of 1.146 for the euro, 1.357 for the pound and 6.399 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.43 and $7.58 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.07 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 of accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 17%.\nWe expect organic sales for our third quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be negative by about 1 point. We expect third quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be $0.01 accretive to EPS, and the inclusion of DECIEM is not expected to be material.\nIn closing, our results thus far clearly demonstrate the power of our diversified portfolio. Temporary softness in our Eastern markets driven by the pandemic was again offset by renewed growth in our Western markets. A resulting slight slowing of growth in skin care was offset by remarkable growth in fragrances.\nWe continue to be choiceful about where we invest, and the flexibility we have built into our cost structure is helping us to mitigate some of the COVID-related disruptions and inflation while allowing us to continue to invest appropriately in our future growth. This agility, along with the resilience of our remarkable teams worldwide, gives us confidence that we can continue to manage through the temporary complexities caused by the prolonged pandemic by focusing clearly on our long-term strategy and executing against it with excellence.\nAnd that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time."

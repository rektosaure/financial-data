Creedon\n\nEVP of U.S. Stores, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With the closing of the Family Dollar sale, the second quarter represents an important milestone in the evolution of the Dollar Tree story. In addition to closing the sale, I'm proud to say we delivered another strong quarter with results exceeding the high end of our expectations and reflecting a high level of execution across the board. The timing of the impacts of tariffs and our mitigation activities played out differently than we originally anticipated, with some of the net positive benefits of our mitigation initiatives coming earlier in Q2 and the tariff impact shifting to later in the year. Having said that, we are pleased with our momentum and our team's ability to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape.\nThe second quarter unfolded against a volatile backdrop for both the consumer and retail industry, as the economy continued to adjust to elevated tariffs, persistent cost pressures and a static labor market. In today's environment, customers are seeking value and convenience more than ever, and Dollar Tree is uniquely positioned to deliver both. Whether it's a mom stretching her grocery budget, a college student outfitting a dorm room or a higher income shopper attracted to an expanded assortment of everyday essentials. Our stores are increasingly the destination of choice. This context is important because our Q2 performance was not just about exceeding a set of earnings expectations. It was about gaining share, expanding our relevance to a broader base of customers and proving once again that Dollar Tree thrives when customers focus on value.\nSo let's walk through the Q2 highlights. Net sales increased 12.3% to $4.6 billion, driven by a 6.5% comp sales growth, which is a solid result in a quarter without major traffic driving events or holidays. Importantly, comp growth was nicely balanced between traffic and ticket and between consumables and discretionary. In fact, it's been 2 years since we've achieved a discretionary comp this high. Additionally, unit growth was positive, even with the limited pricing actions we took in the quarter. The bottom line was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.77 coming in ahead of our outlook. Stewart will walk you through the details of how Q2 benefited from some timing issues and how those should flow through the balance of the year.\nThis positive momentum and consistency of execution demonstrates our growing appeal as a value retailer in periods of increased volatility. More importantly, we believe the customer gains we've made are sustainable, a belief underscored by our growing understanding of the dynamics driving these gains.\nOur dollar and unit share gains accelerated in Q2, providing additional evidence that our value proposition is resonating with customers. Our strong performance was led by seasonal items, party, balloons and personal items as customers find more items through our expanded assortment to help them live and celebrate their lives.\nAs of the end of Q2, we have added 2.4 million new customers on a last 12 months basis, consistent with our pace in recent quarters. And nearly 2/3 of those new customers came from households earning $100,000 or more. Underscoring growing engagement, the number of shoppers visiting 3 or more times a month increased by 11% in Q2, a sequential improvement from the 9% growth we saw last quarter.\nWhile sales growth was strong across all income cohorts, we continue to see especially strong performance from middle and higher income customers, with households earning over $100,000 per year, providing a meaningful portion of our Q2 growth. The strength of these results reflects how our value, convenience and discovery proposition is resonating with more and more customers and leading to increased trade-in activity. The increasing relevance of our expanded assortment is helping us attract and more importantly, retain a broader range of shoppers.\nTo support the rollout of our expanded assortment, we completed 3,600 3.0 format store conversions through the end of Q2 and remain on track to reach our target of approximately 5,000 stores by year-end. Recall that last quarter, we said the distinctions amongst our various multi-price and non multi-price store formats [ were ] beginning to blur as we roll out certain aspects of the expanded assortment across all store formats. And since the flexibility of multiprice is increasingly embedded across all our stores, the relative performance among the various formats is less meaningful.\nAs you could see from our aggregate comp this quarter, the business is doing exceptionally well, and we continue to be pleased with positive contribution from our expanded assortment. Expanding our assortment to include items at a variety of price points is fast becoming the standard Dollar Tree model. It enhances our flexibility, whether through larger pack sizes, better quality items or entirely new categories. The ability to shop for $1.25 snacks and $3 to $5 home decor items in the same trip makes Dollar Tree more compelling than ever. Our expanded assortment makes us more relevant, broadens our customer base, and increases our flexibility in responding to tariffs and other cost pressures.\nTariffs remain a source of ongoing volatility and operating in an environment where rates change frequently remains one of our largest challenges. A quarter ago, we told you we were forecasting the balance of the year based on our expectation that China tariffs would be 30% and the rest of the world would be closer to 10%. Today, tariff guidelines for China have yet to be finalized and currently remain at 30%, but countries like Vietnam, India and Bangladesh are meaningfully higher than they were in June when we provided our last outlook. We are adapting to this volatility and have several strategies in place across the business to address multiple cost pressures, including tariffs.\nOver the past few quarters, we've detailed what we call our 5 levers to mitigate these cost pressures. To review, these levers include negotiating with our suppliers, [ respecting ] products, shifting country of origin, dropping noneconomic SKUs and finally, and as a last resort, pricing. As we demonstrated in Q2 and expect will be true over the balance of the year, these levers are effective mitigation techniques. Using all 5 levers helps us to achieve the lowest landed cost possible and keep delivering compelling value to our customers.\nAs many of you saw in our stores, our price initiatives started in late Q2 and will continue rolling out across the balance of the year. Following the selective pricing actions that we've taken so far, we are pleased with the understanding and resilience of our customers and the effect on unit volume has been less than we initially expected. This again demonstrates the power of our value proposition and validates multi-price as a structural advantage as we navigate a challenging tariff landscape. In a few minutes, Stewart will share more details on our tariff mitigation efforts in Q2 and for the rest of the year.\nBeyond the P&L, execution was strong across the business. Our inventory levels are healthy heading into the fall and holiday seasons. Supply chain performance remains solid with strong in-stocks, favorable freight compared to last year and efficiency gains from DC realignment projects in Odessa and Ocala. In real estate, we have opened 254 new stores so far this year, including 42 former Party City locations and are on track to hit our full year target of approximately 400 stores. Additionally, we have converted 26 former Family Dollar combo stores to full Dollar Trees and expect to convert the remaining 31 stores by year-end. We remain pleased with the outperformance of our new stores, particularly the $0.99 only conversions.\nElsewhere in real estate, the renovation of legacy Dollar Tree locations continues to enhance store conditions and improve the overall productivity of our fleet. Additionally, our expanded preventative maintenance program is reducing downtime and lost business, including a 15% year-over-year reduction in store closed days due to maintenance issues. That is on top of a 50% improvement last year.\nOn August 28, we announced a new partnership with Uber Eats. I'm very excited about this partnership, as it represents the next logical step in meeting our customers where they are and helping them shop the way they want to shop. Importantly, this agreement gives us access to Uber Eats' 25 million customers, which is a newer and younger demographic that Dollar Tree has yet to fully tap into. While it's still early days, we are encouraged by the initial response to the launch.\nIn short, we are executing on growth, productivity and cost control simultaneously. Dollar Tree has always thrived in tough times. From our founding in 1986 to today, our formula has been remarkably consistent, deliver value, convenience and discovery for our customers. With our newly expanded assortment, we can now offer more compelling products and be more agile in navigating tariffs and other cost pressures, all while offering our customers more discovery at still affordable prices. Our ability to adapt not only positions us to withstand volatility, it positions us to gain share in the face of it. Dollar Tree is built to win in these conditions, offering prices that customers value, pack sizes that help them manage tight budgets and a range of products from everyday essentials to the joy of the perfect Treasure Hunt find.\nTaken together, our ability to drive traffic, ticket, comp and market share in a volatile environment highlights the resilience of our model and the ever-increasing agility of our organization.\nBefore I turn things over to Stewart for more detail on our financial results and outlook, I'd like to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of our associates in every store, every distribution center, every support function, our people are the reason Dollar Tree continues to perform at such a high level and in a challenging and unpredictable environment. I'd like to give a special shout out for all the hard work that went into the Family Dollar sales process. This was a massive effort that involved nearly every aspect of the business, and I'm especially grateful for the efforts of everyone involved. The Dollar Tree team's dedication to serving customers and executing our initiatives with urgency, delivers great outcomes and will drive our success for many years to come. Stewart?\n\nStewart F. Glendinning\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Q2 comp sales increased 6.5% and adjusted EPS was $0.77. We recognize that this was substantially better than the outlook we provided last quarter, when we said we expected Q2 comp sales to be towards the higher end of our full year range of 3% to 5% and that adjusted EPS could be down by as much as half compared to the prior year.\nWith respect to compound performance, our initial outlook took into account the relative lack of events and holidays in Q2. But as the quarter unfolded, we saw that the increasing relevance of our expanded assortment to a wider range of customers overpowered the lack of events and Q2 comps came in stronger than we expected.\nWith respect to the EPS outperformance, our sales were higher than anticipated. Our pricing actions started earlier, the timing of how our mitigation efforts impacted COGS differed from our initial expectations, and we were able to leverage our payroll costs in SG&A. The COGS timing difference reflected tariff headwinds shifting from Q2 into Q3 and Q4 and the benefits of our mark on being higher than expected. While all of these factors will impact the cadence of our EPS in the back half of the year, on a full year basis, our outlook remains intact.\nWith that, let's go through the details of our second quarter financial performance. For the quarter, net sales increased 12.3% to $4.6 billion. Comparable store sales increased 6.5%. Growth was balanced with increases of 3% in traffic and 3.4% in ticket. Meanwhile, the sales contribution from noncomp stores also exceeded our expectations based on strong results from new store openings and our $0.99 only conversions. Positive performance was broad-based across categories, with comp up 6.7% for consumables and 6.1% for discretionary, which is particularly impressive, given the seasonal lull we normally see in Q2. Strength in electronics, hardware and lawn and garden drove the healthy mix in the quarter.\nTurning to margins. Q2 gross margin increased 20 basis points to 34.4%. Several factors contributed to this, including lower merchandise costs driven by higher inventory mark-on and lower freight as well as favorable pricing that helped us offset higher tariffs. We also benefited as our mix shifted away from some lower-margin consumable categories. The strong sales comp also helped us leverage occupancy costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher markdown reserves on aged inventory, higher distribution costs and elevated shrink.\nWhile tariffs were a meaningful headwind as expected, we were able to use our 5 mitigation levers to counteract much of the impact. At the Dollar Tree segment level, our Q2 adjusted SG&A rate increased 50 basis points to 26.3% driven by higher store payroll related to stickering activity, wage increases, depreciation, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. These were partially offset by lower general liability expenses and sales leverage. While general liability expense was lower than last year, it was higher than we contemplated in our June outlook. As many companies have noted recently, the cost of claims continues to rise across the industry.\nAt the corporate level, adjusted SG&A expense was higher driven by incentive comp and IT project expense. On a year-over-year basis, prior to TSA income, our corporate SG&A rate held steady at 3.1%. Subsequent to the sale of Family Dollar, we received $8 million of TSA income net during the second quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7.4% to $236 million and operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 5.2%. This was significantly better than our outlook, reflecting the sales outperformance, expense control and timing benefits.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Total inventory increased $112 million or 4.4%, reflecting store growth, our expanded assortment and inventory mark-on related to our pricing initiatives. We ended the quarter with $666 million in cash and cash equivalents. On the Q2 cash flow statement, we generated $261 million in cash from operating activities and had capital expenditure of $245 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $16 million, which was a $131 million positive swing year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $145 million of free cash flow.\nAdditionally, in Q2, we received $668 million of cash proceeds from the sale of Family Dollar. On top of that, we expect approximately $425 million of cash tax benefits from the sale and approximately $100 million of accelerated cash tax benefits as a result of the recently enacted tax bill. Also, during the quarter, we paid off our $1 billion May 2025, 4% senior notes using a combination of commercial paper and available cash on hand. In the near term, we will continue to leverage commercial paper and available cash.\nIn Q2, we repurchased 5 million shares of $501 million, including excise tax. Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 0.6 million shares for $71 million. Year-to-date, we've completed $1 billion in share purchases or approximately 11.6 million shares at an average price of $86 per share.\nWe ended the quarter with healthy liquidity, a more flexible balance sheet and ample capacity to fund growth while returning capital to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent and include investing growth for new stores, multi-price conversions and supply chain efficiency, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, return capital to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases.\nNow let me provide an update on our full year 2025 outlook. We now expect comparable sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS of $5.32 to $5.72, assuming current tariff rates. Gross margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points driven by pricing, freight and partially offset by higher tariffs. For Dollar Tree segment adjusted SG&A, we anticipate approximately 120 basis points of year-over-year deleveraging driven by a modestly higher outlook for labor and general liability costs.\nFor corporate SG&A, prior to any TSA reimbursement, we expect costs to increase approximately 11% to 12% on a year-over-year basis. TSA proceeds of approximately $55 million to $60 million, subject to final adjustments. On a net basis, our outlook for adjusted corporate SG&A net of TSA proceeds remains essentially unchanged.\nFinishing the P&L, we expect net interest expense of approximately $100 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. We still expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including approximately 400 new Dollar Tree store openings.\nWe remain committed to offsetting cost pressures, including tariffs through our 5 levers while sustaining investment in growth initiatives and store expansion. Throughout the balance of 2025, we will be focused on consistent execution, disciplined cost control and delivering value to customers in what remains a challenging macro environment. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael C. Creedon\n\nEVP of U.S. Stores, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stewart. Our second quarter results reinforce the unique position Dollar Tree holds in today's retail landscape. We delivered strong sales growth, margin outperformance and market share gains, all while navigating cost pressures in a dynamic consumer environment. With the Family Dollar divestiture complete, Dollar Tree is now a fully focused business. Every ounce of our leadership attention, capital investment and operating resources is now directed towards strengthening the core Dollar Tree brand. This sharper focus is already showing up in the pace of conversions, new openings, and faster decision-making on pricing, assortment and sourcing.\nLooking ahead, our strategic priorities remain clear: one, continue the rollout of our expanded assortment, which is driving higher traffic, ticket and discretionary penetration; two, manage costs with agility, use our 5 mitigation levers to protect margins while maintaining customer value; three, invest in the customer experience with compelling assortments, clean stores and well stocked shelves; and four, drive disciplined growth and returns, supported by a strong balance sheet, free cash flow and the proceeds from Family Dollar.\nWe entered the back half of the year with strong momentum, healthy inventory, a clear strategy and the resources to execute. That gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to deliver for our customers, associates and shareholders, not just in the near term, but for the long run.\nFinally, as we mentioned last quarter, we'll be hosting an Investor Day in New York on October 15 to share a refreshed long-term strategy and financial outlook for the stand-alone Dollar Tree business. This will be an important opportunity to show you how we intend to build on the momentum we've established and how we see the company evolving over time. Importantly, we will share more details about our updated strategic road map and financial framework. We look forward to showcasing the growth runway ahead, the earnings power of our expanded assortment and the operational improvements we are embedding across the business. And with that, we're ready to take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Dollar Tree. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nRobert Andrew LaFleur\n\nHead of IR, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 results. With me today are Dollar Tree's CEO, Mike Creedon; and CFO, Stewart Glendinning.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the remarks that we will make today about the company's expectations, plans and future prospects are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 are against the same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, Mike and Stewart will take your questions. Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Creedon\n\nEVP of U.S. Stores, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let me begin my comments by thanking our associates and leadership team for their efforts in delivering a strong first quarter result. In Q1, we delivered upside across every key metric and results exceeded the outlook we provided. Our expanded assortment strategy is having the intended impact of driving incremental traffic, ticket and comp.\nWe also continue to grow the Dollar Tree footprint, recently celebrating the opening of our 9,000th store located in Plano, Texas. As excited as we are to reach this milestone, we're just as excited about the growth runway ahead of us.\nTurning now to our Q1 results. We are pleased with our performance. Amid increasing volatility, we remain focused on the things that are within our control and our results demonstrate just how much progress our teams have made in areas like rolling out our expanded assortment, improving store conditions and achieving strong sell-through of seasonal merchandise.\nQ1 comps and net sales both exceeded the high end of our outlook range, driven by a strong Valentine's Day and Easter. Additionally, the revenue contribution from noncomp stores was up nearly 90% year-over-year, led by ongoing strength in the former $0.99 only portfolio. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations came in $0.01 above our outlook range at $1.26, reflecting strong sales and ongoing focus in expense management.\nDollar Tree's 5.4% cap was nicely balanced with traffic up 2.5% and ticket up 2.8%. And category performance was strong across the board with consumables comp up 6.4% and discretionary comp up 4.6%, our highest discretionary comp since Q4 of 2022.\nWe always start with our customer. And today, our customers need us now more than ever. Each week, more shoppers across a diverse range of economic and demographic backgrounds are responding to the appeal of Dollar Tree's unique value, convenience and discovery proposition. Our gains in dollar and unit market share accelerated in Q1. In fact, we gained twice as much unit share in Q1 as we did in Q4. These gains are driven by strong trends in immediate consumption purchases like candy, snacks and beverages as well as key discretionary categories.\nNew customers and increasing trip frequency are both driving share gains. We added 2.6 million new customers in Q1, and the number of customers who visit a Dollar Tree store 3 times a month or more increased by 9%.\nTrade and trends remain strong as we attract customers from other retail channels. In recent quarters, higher income customers have been a meaningful growth driver for us. In Q1, we had measurable sales improvement across all income levels with the most growth coming from our higher income customers. In particular, we saw a meaningful traffic increase from customers with household incomes of more than $100,000, demonstrating Dollar Tree's broad appeal.\nDollar Tree is resonating with its customers. In the current environment, our low prices and smaller pack sizes are perfect for families trying to manage a tight household budget. And our expanded assortment is attractive to all customers across every income level. We believe that value, convenience and discovery is exactly the right formula for all of our customers.\nQ1 marked the 1-year anniversary of our Multi-Price 3.0 launch, demonstrating the broader appeal of our expanded assortment, the 3.0 portfolio continues to outperform our other store formats by providing a nice boost to traffic, ticket, comp and discretionary mix. During the quarter, we completed approximately 500 3.0 conversions, and we are still on track to have about half the store base converted by year-end.\nNow let me shift to tariffs. As I detailed for you last quarter, our merchant and operations teams have spent the past several years developing contingency plans to address a wide range of potential disruptions to global trade, including tariffs. As a result of these efforts, we have multiple tools in place to address any challenges. As a reminder, the 5 levers we have available to address cost inflation, including tariffs are negotiating with our suppliers, reinspecting products, moving country of origin, dropping noneconomic items and leveraging our expanded multi-price capabilities. Today, we are actively engaged on multiple fronts to mitigate the impact of inflationary cost pressures, including tariffs.\nAs we discussed last quarter, our teams effectively use these levers to offset 90% of the first round of tariffs, the initial 10% announced in February. And we are continuing to employ these levers to address the latest round. But the tariff landscape is highly fluid and changing week to week. So we are focused on agility and on improving that agility. As always, our goal is to use our significant scale, combined with the uniqueness and flexibility of our assortment to secure the lowest landed cost on the products we source and provide our customers with compelling products at a great relative value.\nSince our founding, we have been committed to delivering great value at low prices, and that mission is just as central to our business today as it was when Macon Brock, Doug Perry and Ray Compton opened the first Dollar Only store back in 1986. To put things in perspective, the average unit retail or AUR in our first Dollar Store was $1. Today, almost 40 years later, our AUR is around $1.35, and 85% of the items in the store are still priced under $2. No other retailer has been able to sustain a value proposition like that for as long as we have.\nWhat has made us successful over the years is our ability to remain agile in how we deliver value. We are constantly adapting to the evolving needs of our customers, not just by what we offer, but by how we offer it.\nThe evolution of our business model towards multi-price has added a new dimension to our agility. Multi price allows us to expand our product assortment to give customers access to a wider variety of items at a wider variety of value-centered price points. This way, our offerings remain attractive and relevant under a wide range of macro inflationary and tariff scenarios. And as the success of our 3.0 stores suggest, our customers are responding positively.\nAs we build on the ability to meet our customers' needs and deliver great value, we will continue to scale this model. This enables us to respond to our customers' needs, strengthen our value proposition and support profitable growth over the long term.\nGiven the volatility of today's operating environment, it is challenging to predict with precision the near-term performance of the business in Q2, especially regarding tariff and other cost mitigation efforts. Stepping back and taking a full year view, we believe that by successfully deploying our 5 levers, we will be able to mitigate most, if not all, of the potential earnings impact from higher tariffs, assuming the current levels remain in place.\nTo this end, we are updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook range to $5. 15 to $5.65, which is essentially the outlook we provided last quarter, adjusted for our year-to-date share repurchases. Stewart will share more details on our outlook shortly.\nBefore I close, I wanted to update you on the Family Dollar sale. We have received U.S. regulatory approval for the transaction, and we remain on track for an early summer close. As we work through the final logistics of separating the 2 companies, our leadership team remains focused on growing and strengthening the core Dollar Tree business. As I detailed last quarter, selling Family Dollar sharpens our operational focus, strengthens our balance sheet and is highly cash flow accretive.\nIn closing, we're proud of what we accomplished this quarter, and we're even more excited about what lies ahead. Our strong performance in Q1 underscores the progress we've made against our strategic priorities. And it is a clear signal that our customers are responding positively to that progress. From store operations to merchandising, from sourcing to in-store execution, every part of our business is becoming more agile, better aligned and more resilient. The Dollar Tree model is uniquely positioned to succeed in times like these. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of our teams, I'm confident in our ability to navigate whatever near-term challenges we may face. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart. Stewart?\n\nStewart F. Glendinning\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As Mike mentioned, our latest results reflect continued top line momentum and strong margin performance. Solid execution of our multi-price strategy and expense management combined to deliver upside relative to our internal expectations and the Q1 outlook that we previously provided. Unless otherwise noted, I'll focus my prepared comments on Dollar Tree's continuing operations.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.26, which exceeded the high end of our outlook range of $1.10 to $1.25. Turning to results from continuing operations as compared to the same period of last year, our revenue increased by 11.3%, driven by a 5.4% comparable store sales growth and a 7.4% increase in square footage from last year.\nAdjusted operating income was $388 million, a 1.4% increase from last year. Adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points, driven by a 20 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 100 basis point increase in the adjusted SG&A rate.\nThe gross margin improvement came from lower freight costs, improved mark-on and lower occupancy due to sales leverage from the strong comps. Our SG&A rate was negatively impacted by higher depreciation related to investments in our stores, wage-related payroll increases, general liability claims and utility costs partially offset by lower stock compensation expense and less temporary labor related to our 3.0 conversions. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1%, compared to 24.6%, reflecting increased tax expense for share-based payment awards. Adjusted net income was $270 million, compared to $268 million.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Total inventory increased $247 million or 10% to $2.7 billion on higher mark on and inventory receipts as we expanded our multi-price assortment. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. On the cash flow statement for continuing operations for the quarter, generated $379 million in cash from operating activities, had capital expenditures of $249 million and delivered $130 million of free cash flow.\nWe ended the quarter with no borrowings under our revolvers, no commercial paper outstanding and bank-defined leverage below 2.5x. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we paid off our $1 billion May 2025 senior notes using a combination of commercial paper and available cash on hand. Recall that on last quarter's call, we announced a new $1 billion 364-day revolver to address this maturity in addition to extending our pre-existing 5-year $1.5 billion credit facility to 2030. As a result, we continue to have ample liquidity between cash on hand and availability under these credit facilities to meet the ongoing capital needs of the business.\nAs Mike mentioned, the proceeds from the Family Dollar sale will put us in an even stronger cash position. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $437 million, including excise tax. Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased an additional 780,000 shares for approximately $68 million. Year-to-date, we have completed over $500 million of share repurchases.\nThe pending sale of Family Dollar remains on track, and we expect the transaction to close during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we are in the process of establishing transition service agreements, or TSAs, for shared services. These agreements will allow us to provide ongoing support and services to the new buyers and to ensure business continuity for Family Dollar after the separation is complete. Recall that because Family Dollar is being treated as discontinued operations from an accounting perspective, Dollar Tree will be burdened by a full year of corporate SG&A, but we will not receive any TSA-related income to offset these expenses until after the deal closes. This timing mismatch will negatively impact our first half and full year profitability.\nOur current outlook for TSA-related income for fiscal 2025 is approximately $85 million to $90 million subject to final adjustment at the time of deal close. This figure is based on internal and third-party estimates and will begin meaningfully running through the P&L in the third and fourth quarters.\nNow let me provide our updated perspective on fiscal 2025. First, we are reiterating the full year comp and revenue outlook that we provided last quarter, namely net sales in the range of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion and comparable same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. We are updating our outlook for full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to $5.15 to $5.65, which is essentially the same net income range implied by our previous outlook, adjusted to reflect our year-to-date share repurchases.\nOver the balance of this year, assuming tariffs remain at their current levels, we believe we can address the tariff and other cost pressures we face using the 5 levers that Mike discussed earlier. In the near term, we do expect to see some volatility relating to timing issues as the various inputs and outputs work their way through our P&L. While we delayed some shipments in early April when the tariff adjustments were first announced, some products did arrive in the United States that were subject to the highest tariffs and some of those items will work their way through our system before the full breadth of our mitigation efforts are deployed. As such, we expect our second quarter profits to be meaningfully lower than last year in light of higher tariff and other costs, including some costs we absorbed during the 145% window on China tariffs.\nFrom a timing perspective, that is approximately $70 million more of a COGS impact in the second quarter than what was contemplated in our original [indiscernible] is also fluid. We now expect the initial round of labor and other cost investments associated with these efforts in the second quarter to be approximately $40 million higher. We expect the benefits of these efforts will be largely realized on a go-forward basis in the second half of the year. So on a net basis, we're expecting a transitory impact on our near-term profitability as elevated costs run through our P&L in Q2, while the benefits and profit recovery from our mitigation efforts should materialize later in the year. As such, our Q2 adjusted EPS from continuing operations could be down as much as 45% to 50% year-over-year before reaccelerating in Q3 and Q4 to get us back on track to reach our full year target.\nWe expect to recover these costs in the back half of the year given the lower tariff rates that are currently in effect and as we ramp up our commercial efforts and build on the strong business trends we saw in Q1. It's worth noting that on a gross unmitigated basis, all the higher tariff rates announced this year amount to a year-over-year cost increase of approximately $200 million across the balance of this fiscal year. To put this in context of the line item, this is less than our expected payroll inflation for the full year. So we're well equipped to deal with the tariffs as we address other cost increases as well.\nFrom a top line perspective, given trends to date and our outlook for the balance of the quarter, we believe Q2 comps will be towards the higher end of our full year outlook range of 3% to 5%. On full year basis, assuming tariff rates remain at their current levels, we believe we can offset the negative earnings impact of inflationary costs, including tariffs and deliver $5.15 to $5.65 of adjusted EPS. With that, for the full year on a continuing operation basis, we expect gross margin improvement of approximately 50 to 75 basis points.\nFor Dollar Tree segment SG&A, we anticipate approximately 100 to 110 basis points of year-over-year deleveraging. For corporate SG&A, prior to any TSA reimbursement, we expect costs to increase approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis. We expect TSA proceeds of approximately $85 million to $90 million subject to final adjustments.\nFinishing the P&L, we expect net interest and other income of approximately $95 million and an effective tax rate of 25%. We still expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including approximately 400 new Dollar Tree store openings and approximately $110 million as we start reconstruction of our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma. Here, I would also add that 2025 should be the peak in our multiyear investment cycle. So we would expect CapEx to be lower in 2026 and 2027.\nWith respect to cash, we ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. We expect approximately $800 million of net proceeds from the Family Dollar sale and $350 million of cash tax benefits from the transaction. Our capital allocation priorities remain investing in the growth of the business and then returning cash to shareholders. Our preferred vehicle remains share repurchase.\nWhile 2025 is shaping up to be a more complicated year than we initially anticipated, we are encouraged by our strong sales trends driven by our attractive value proposition of multiprice efforts, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate our way through the current environment and still achieve our profitability goals for the year. We're looking forward to the closing of the Family Dollar sale, and we feel great about our cash position and the future growth prospects of our business. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Creedon\n\nEVP of U.S. Stores, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stewart. History has shown that we have the resilience to emerge stronger from periods of economic uncertainty, and that strength comes from the dedication and adaptability of our associates. In today's rapidly evolving environment, we see a meaningful opportunity to build on that foundation by enhancing our merchandising efforts and further elevating the value we deliver to our customers. .\nThanks to the hard work and commitment of our teams, I'm confident in our ability to meet customers' needs with our exceptional value proposition, including multi-price and to navigate whatever near-term challenges we may face.\nFinally, with the sale of Family Dollar set to close here shortly and Dollar Tree setting off on its new journey as a stand-alone business, we think it's appropriate to provide the Street with a refreshed view of our long-term strategy and financial outlook. So we're planning to host an Investor Day in New York on October 15. We'll provide all the invitation details a little closer to the event. And with that, we're ready to take your questions.",

Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. It's great to be with you again. When we recently gathered in New York for Investor Day, I said this was the start of a new era for Dollar Tree: one company, one brand, one focus. Our energy is now directed towards strengthening and growing the Dollar Tree business. We delivered a high-quality quarter accompanied by mid-single-digit comps, above-outlook earnings, and strong end-of-quarter momentum heading into the holidays. These results speak to our disciplined execution and focused strategy. Let me start by framing the quarter at a high level, and then Stewart will take you through the financial details. First, I'd like to highlight the strength of our discretionary business, which showed its first positive year-over-year mix shift since Q1 of 2022.\nWe believe this strength illustrates how our exceptional value proposition, including our growing multi-price assortment, is resonating with our shoppers by helping them meet their needs and desires in the budget-constrained environment that many consumers find themselves today. The three pillars that define Dollar Tree are value, convenience, and discovery. Those are not slogans; they're how we win. They describe a brand that offers customers compelling values across a variety of price points that help them do more with less in stores that are easy to shop and full of surprises worth discovering. While the consumer landscape remains uneven, the underlying story remains consistent: all consumers are seeking value. Marrying that value-seeking behavior with convenience and discovery is the intersection where Dollar Tree thrives. The evidence is clear.\nDollar Tree continues to gain share and attract new shoppers while continuing to serve its large and loyal base of core customers. Today, we serve an increasingly broad spectrum of shoppers, from core value-focused households to middle and higher-income shoppers who are making deliberate choices about how and where they spend. We had 3 million more households shop with us in Q3 this year compared to Q3 last year. Approximately 60% of these incremental shoppers came from higher-income households, those earning over $100,000, 30% from middle-income households, those earning between $60,000-$100,000, with the rest from lower-income households, those earning under $60,000. Importantly, Q3 spending growth was broad-based across all income sub-cohorts, including households earning below $20,000. To us, this demonstrates that Dollar Tree isn't just for tough times or for those with limited resources.\nDollar Tree is for smart shoppers across all income brackets where value, convenience, and discovery matter. At the same time, higher-income households are trading into Dollar Tree. Lower-income households are depending on us more than ever. For example, the average spend for lower-income households grew more than twice as fast in the third quarter as the average spend for higher-income households. While part of this reflects the fact that higher-income households are typically earlier in their customer lifecycle with us, the data clearly shows that our core customer remains loyal and deeply engaged. She's balancing her household budget carefully and continues to count on Dollar Tree for essentials and, increasingly, for the seasonal and discretionary items that bring joy to her and her family. Over time, our goal is to inspire the same level of loyalty in our newer, higher-income customers that we see in our core customers.\nWhile the average per household spend for our higher-income customers is currently lower, even given their higher income, larger average basket size, and ability to spend more, this is a simple function of trip frequency. Because many of our higher-income customers are still early in their relationship with Dollar Tree, their purchase frequency has significant room to grow. Over time, we believe that growing trip frequency among these higher-income customers, given their propensity to build bigger baskets, will be a powerful growth driver for Dollar Tree. This is why our brand promise matters so much right now. We make it easier for customers to do more with less without trading down on quality or experience. That is what keeps our traffic and baskets healthy in a cautious consumer environment. With that, let's take a look at some of our Q3 highlights.\nComparable sales increased 4.2%, a nice acceleration from the quarter-to-date trend of 3.8% we shared in mid-October. As the results suggest, October finished strong, driven by momentum in our multi-price assortment and a great Halloween. Our Q3 comp was all ticket-driven as traffic was slightly negative. Discretionary mix improved 40 basis points to 50.5%. Comp increased 4.8% in discretionary and 3.5% in consumables. Gross margin performance exceeded expectations, reflecting strong operational execution and cost discipline. Adjusted EPS of $1.21 was nicely above our outlook, and Stewart will go through the drivers behind this upside in his remarks. We believe these results reflect our sharper focus and more disciplined execution. Multi-price was a key driver of our Q3 momentum. As a reminder, multi-price is a deliberate, long-term, data-driven strategy that began back in 2019 to make Dollar Tree more relevant, flexible, and profitable.\nMulti-price is about evolving our assortment over time to include new, more relevant, and attractively valued items that we could not offer at a fixed price point of $1 or $1.25. Multi-price is one of the most important strategic shifts in Dollar Tree's modern history, and it's working. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, the roughly 5.5% annual comp we've averaged since breaking the dollar in 2022 is among the very best in all of retail. Those of you who attended our Investor Day may recall a slide from Stewart's presentation where he demonstrated how expanded multi-price penetration in categories like electronics, hardware, and Easter had a meaningfully positive impact on sales and per-unit profitability. We've reproduced a similar analysis on our multi-price Halloween assortment this year, which we've included in our supplemental presentation available on our Investor Relations website.\nOur Halloween performance this year is another clear example of the power of multi-price. This year, our Halloween assortment generated over $200 million in sales, an all-time record. But to see the full impact of multi-price, let's go back to Halloween 2022, when multi-price was still in its infancy. That year, multi-price represented about 3% of units sold, 10% of sales, and 7% of merchandise gross margin across our full Halloween assortment. Fast forward to 2025, on a 25% larger base of sales, where multi-price accounted for roughly a quater of our total Halloween sales and merchandise gross margin, but only 8% of Halloween units sold. We are continually engineering incremental value and profitability drivers into our multi-price assortment. Across Halloween this year, each multi-price item that we sold generated 3.5x more profit than each non-multi-price item we sold.\nThis is a full turn higher than Halloween 2022. By combining this increased per-unit profitability with a higher multi-price mix, we were able to generate approximately 25% more margin dollars from our Halloween assortment this year compared to 2022, while selling approximately 10% fewer units. This is just the positive impact on merchandise margin. It doesn't take into consideration any labor or distribution cost savings that come from handling fewer units. Looking at it this way, multi-price is a powerful growth and profitability driver. It broadens our value proposition and relevance to our customers, allows us to compete more effectively, helps drive cost leverage, and sets the business up for long-term success. More importantly, we are just getting started. Multi-price is not a one-and-done proposition. We expect these dynamics to play out across every holiday and special occasion and strengthen as our multi-price penetration expands.\nOver time, our customers will let us know what the right multi-price mix ultimately is, but we're confident that it's meaningfully higher than where we are today. So let's take a look at some broader merchandising highlights from the quarter. Discretionary categories accelerated through the quarter with standout performances in party and home decor. Consumables were steady, led by household cleaning, personal care, snacks, and cookies. Seasonal performance was strong, particularly towards the end of the quarter. We planned the inventory carefully, had strong in-store execution, and are pleased with our sell-through. Those wins are proof points for our merchandising strategy and ever-changing, more relevant assortment that drives trip completion and, more importantly, enhances profitability and margin performance. Today, with a wider assortment of multi-price merchandise and restickering largely complete, 85% of the items in our store are still priced at $2 or below.\nOffering a broad range of price points while staying firmly grounded in value preserves the integrity of the Dollar Tree brand. We believe time, convenience, pack size, and quality are all part of our customer's value calculation, and so is an expanded range of products that address a wide range of shopping occasions. When a customer can fill a basket with snacks, cleaning supplies, home decor items, and seasonal products all at a great value, that's when the Dollar Tree magic is on full display. Q3 results were also powered by strong execution in our stores, supply chain, and support functions. At Investor Day, Jocy Conrad spoke about our commitment to simplify work, elevate standards, and empower our people. In Q3, we saw measurable improvement in these key areas. On store standards, we've rolled out new tools and training that simplify store routines and improve accountability.\nThe results are visible with cleaner aisles, stock shelves, and faster checkouts, with more to come. On associate engagement, our Race to Gold initiative continues to gain traction. As we've increased our investment in training and career progression, we've seen continued improvement in turnover. In supply chain, the network is performing at a very high level. Service levels and in-stocks coming out of this year's peak season are among the highest we've seen, and our planned increases in distribution capacity over the next several years should allow us to unlock even greater operating efficiencies and distribution cost savings. In technology, we continue to modernize our back-office systems and upgrade store infrastructure. These investments are simplifying work and enabling smarter decision-making in merchandising and replenishment. All of this comes down to one thing: making it easier for our teams to deliver a consistently great experience for our customers.\nWith the Family Dollar sale behind us, we are already seeing measurable improvements in our culture and performance. We are fully aligned behind one brand, one set of priorities, and one mission, with leadership and investment focus concentrated on growing Dollar Tree. Every decision across product, stores, technology, supply chain, and people is aligned to strengthening one business. That alignment brings speed and accountability. Teams test, learn, and scale faster, and we now measure progress across a single set of metrics directly tied to creating shareholder value. We are moving forward with purpose, clarity, and conviction, guided by the five strategic priorities we laid out at our Investor Day. Surprise and delight our customer with an expanded, more relevant assortment. Manage expenses with agility by controlling the cost of the goods we sell and managing our SG&A with discipline to drive operating leverage and profitability.\nCreate a strong connection with our customers with cost-effective, quick-return, data-driven marketing. Open more stores and improve the condition of our fleet. And finally, improve the in-store experience for our customers by raising the bar on our store standards. At the foundation of these priorities are a fast, flexible, and efficient supply chain and disciplined financial management that focuses on high-return investments and smart capital allocation. And at the forefront of our success is our people, the more than 150,000 associates who show up every day to serve our customers, support their colleagues, and strengthen the communities where we operate. They are the reason we do what we do and the driving force behind every decision we make. As you heard me emphasize at Investor Day, we manage this business with a focus on what I call the say-do ratio, making clear commitments and delivering on those commitments.\nThis mindset builds trust and accountability across the organization, and we believe that maintaining alignment between what we say and what we do is how we deliver consistent performance over time. In summary, we are pleased with our Q3 results. We're building a stronger foundation for the future, and we're confident about the direction we're heading. With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Q3 comp sales increased 4.2%, and adjusted EPS was $1.21. Both our comp performance and our adjusted EPS were ahead of the expectations we shared in mid-October. The 40 basis points of Q3 comp acceleration between the middle and end of October was driven by a late but strong performance in Halloween sales on the back of a deeper multi-price assortment and excellent execution across our stores. Dollar Tree's seasonal assortment and value resonated strongly with shoppers.\nOur EPS improvement versus expectations was largely driven by freight, higher discretionary sales mix, and SG&A. With that, let's go over the details of our third-quarter results. Q3 net sales increased 9.4% to $4.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, Q3 comp growth was primarily ticket-driven as traffic was slightly negative. Average ticket growth was supported by increased multi-price penetration, particularly across our Halloween assortment and the pricing actions we began rolling out last quarter. Importantly, strong execution around merchandise cost, tariff mitigation, freight, and operating expenses helped drive profitability. Q3 gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 35.8%. These results reflect the strength of our assortment and the agility of our merchandising, supply chain, and store operations teams.\nThe key drivers of this improvement were merchandise margin, successful execution of our five merchant levers, renegotiation, re-engineering, shifting country of origin, discontinuing, and targeted price changes, all contributed to our ability to manage increased costs from tariffs. Freight, import, and inbound freight rates were favorable versus prior year, with lower spot market utilization and better container flow-through at our DCs. Domestic transportation costs were also favorable. Mix, discretionary and seasonal categories, particularly Halloween, were stronger than expected, increasing the realized mark-on. Markdowns, as part of the ongoing strategic initiative to increase shelf productivity that we outlined at Investor Day, we identified and wrote off various slow-turning SKUs. This will create room for more productive items and help optimize storage space utilization in our stores and DCs. The total impact to Q3 earnings was approximately $56 million, or approximately $0.21 of EPS.\nWe believe we will see increased sales and profits per store going forward as we bring in new items or reallocate shelf space to existing but faster-turning products. Shrink, overall, Shrink was higher than last year, but in line with our expectations. These drivers, taken together, drove the Q3 gross margin performance. At the Dollar Tree segment level, our Q3 adjusted SG&A rate increased 160 basis points to 26.2%, driven by higher store payroll related to wage increases and restickering, general liability claims costs, and DNA from elevated store investments. These were partially offset by sales leverage. As a reminder, we do not expect costs related to restickering and other price-related activities to be repeated next year. Also, the wage-related payroll increases this year were expected and planned. Looking forward to next year, we expect wage growth to moderate.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, on a go-forward basis, our goal is to grow Dollar Tree segment SG&A per store below the rate of inflation while reinvesting selectively in high-return initiatives that enhance the customer experience and the long-term profitability of our store base. We believe this will result in future SG&A cost leverage. Adjusted corporate SG&A should be considered net of TSA income because of the costs we carry in order to service the Family Dollar transition. Using this lens, our adjusted corporate SG&A rate, net of the $24 million of TSA income, leveraged 80 basis points to 2.4%, a positive step toward our goal of reducing corporate SG&A to 2% of sales by fiscal 2028. Adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $345 million.\nOur operating margin contracted by 30 basis points to 7.3%, reflecting the offset between the gross margin expansion and SG&A deleveraging, partially driven by cost headwinds such as restickering that will not repeat in 2026. Keep in mind our comments with respect to anticipated SG&A leverage next year at both the Dollar Tree segment and the corporate level. Net interest expense and our adjusted tax rate were broadly in line with expectations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 12% to $1.21. Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory was down $143 million, or 5% versus prior year, while sales increased by 9.4%. Our store count increased by 4.5%, and we ramped up our DCs in Ocala and Odessa. This reduction reflects our focused efforts to increase inventory turns and improve shelf productivity.\nWe ended the quarter with $620 million of commercial paper notes outstanding and $595 million in cash and cash equivalents. On the Q3 cash flow statement, we generated $319 million in cash from operating activities and had capital expenditures of $376 million. This resulted in negative free cash flow in the quarter of $57 million. Year-to-date, we've generated $88 million of free cash flow. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is our highest cash-generating quarter because of normally high levels of sales and because our capital expenditures skew towards the first three quarters of the year. In Q3, we purchased 4.1 million shares for $399 million, including excise tax. Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $176 million. Year to date, we've completed $1.5 billion of share repurchases, or approximately 16.7 million shares at an average price of $90 per share.\nThis represents approximately 8% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year. Our liquidity remains healthy, our balance sheet remains flexible, and we have ample capacity to fund our growth and return significant capital to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Number one, invest in growth. Number two, maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. And number three, return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect Q4 comps will come in between 4% and 6%, which should support net sales of $5.4 to $5.5 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.40-$2.60. On a full-year basis, this would raise our comp outlook to between 5% and 5.5% and our adjusted EPS outlook to $5.60-$5.80.\nThe underlying assumptions incorporated into our full-year outlook are as follows: net sales of approximately $19.35-$19.45 billion, gross margin expansion of approximately 50-60 basis points, reflecting sustained favorability in merchandise margin, freight, and occupancy leverage, with some offset from markdown and Shrink. Dollar Tree segment SG&A deleverage of approximately 120 basis points, primarily driven by higher store payroll related to wage increases and restickering and, to a lesser extent, facilities costs and DNA. Corporate SG&A costs we expect corporate SG&A net of $55 million of TSA income to decrease by approximately 3% year-over-year. Net interest expense of approximately $85 million-$90 million, which is about $10 million-$15 million below our prior outlook. An effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Shares outstanding of approximately 206.4 million, reflecting our share repurchase activity through December 2nd.\nWe remain on track to meet our full-year CapEx target of $1.2 billion-$1.3 billion. We understand that at this point, many of you are shifting your attention to next year. As is customary, we intend to give a detailed outlook for 2026 on our next earnings call in March. With that said, I will remind you of the directional outlook we provided at our Investor Day, where we outlined an algorithm for adjusted EPS to grow at a 12%-15% CAGR through 2028, supported by underlying EPS growth of 8%-10%, with the balance being driven by the unwind of certain discrete items, mostly affecting 2026, with some residual carryover into 2027. To review the underlying details of the algorithm, I direct you to our Investor Day presentation, which is archived on our IR site, and we will give you more specifics and any updates next quarter.\nTo wrap up, we're executing well against the roadmap we shared with you in mid-October. Each day, we continue to see tangible proof that the fundamental appeal of this business, value, convenience, and discovery is resonating with customers and translating into strong financial results. With that, I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nThanks, Stewart. Let me wrap up by putting Q3 in the broader context of where we are and where we're going. When we shared our roadmap at Investor Day, we said this transformation was about focus, consistency, and accountability. We believe Q3 was a strong proof point that our strategy is working. We delivered above-market comps, expanded gross margin, and continued to make meaningful cultural progress across the organization. Today, Dollar Tree is a pure-play value retailer with the scale and focus to compete at the highest level.\nPost Family Dollar, we have clarity of purpose, and our teams are responding with renewed intensity. As we look to Q4, the setup is solid. Halloween was great, and our Thanksgiving and Christmas assortments are resonating with our customers as we remain focused on consistently delivering unbeatable wow value and the thrill of the hunt experience. As 2025 winds down, let me wrap up by saying first to our associates, thank you. Your dedication, creativity, and pride in the work you do are what makes Dollar Tree special. To our customers, thank you for your trust and loyalty, for choosing us for the moments, big and small, that matter the most in your daily lives. And to our shareholders, thank you for your continued confidence and partnership. With that, Stewart and I are happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue.

One moment, please, for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMatt Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, and congrats on another nice quarter. So maybe two parts. Mike, could you elaborate on drivers of the same-store sales acceleration that you saw in October, speak to comp trends that you've seen in November that support the four to six fourth-quarter comp guide?\nAnd then, Stewart, could you just help break down Gross Margin expansion opportunities in the fourth quarter and how best to think about Gross Margin puts and takes maybe at a high level for next year?\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, sure, Matt. As we looked at how the quarter unfolded, Halloween was just a great finish to the quarter. It did come, as we see in times like this, people buying for need and a little closer to need. So it came a little later, but it came incredibly powerfully, and it came with a record number. If you go back, Easter performed that way. A great Easter, a great Halloween. And our setup for Thanksgiving and Christmas is just fantastic. So we really look at what we've done with multi-price and how the assortment's gotten better.\nOur customer across all incomes is really resonating with that and providing just fantastic sales for us. So we feel really good about our guide on the four to six.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nMatt, let me pick up on the gross margin for the fourth quarter and then just talk a little bit about next year. So first of all, as we think about the fourth quarter, the same kind of levers that you saw in the third quarter, we detailed some of that in our supplementary materials as well as in my prepared remarks, are going to be drivers in the fourth quarter. You will see a very powerful fourth quarter on the back of those drivers. If you look to next year and just think about next year, freight is a benefit; certainly in that fourth quarter it came through in the third quarter.\nAs you look to next year, both freight and markdowns are the areas that we'll be watching. If you think about how we operate our business, we buy to a margin. So when we set up our goal for next year, we shared with you that we said we would be equivalent to this year's margin ±50 basis points, and that's the place that we're targeting. There may be continued benefit in freight as we move into next year. There is some belief that perhaps on the freight side, we'll see a tightening of capacity later in the year, and we are watching the potential shortage of drivers. But understand that the reason I bring up the targeted gross margin is because we use those five merchant levers to achieve that margin. So I think the margin you can take to the bank for next year.\nThe second piece is to refer back to the Investor Day materials that we had. In our recent Investor Day, we shared with you an algorithm that said we would achieve high teens improvement next year. That's on the basis of that same gross margin achievement and based on some of the discrete items that we're expecting to see in the coming year. So we're set up well for next year, and I think that probably gives you the main drivers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lassar with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. It's on traffic, and obviously, this was the first decline in traffic that Dollar Tree has experienced in a while.\nTo what degree is that as a result of some of the legacy households pushing back on the price increases that have been taken in the last couple of quarters? And if that's the case, does that give you any pause on your ability to achieve this high teens EPS growth next year in light of the prospect that you might have to make some investments in order to recapture those households that are just dissatisfied with the pricing changes? Thank you so much.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, Michael, we really see traffic as a mix between some internal activity, namely the restickering, and some broader retail trends. We don't see it as a pushback from our customer. And if you look at our performance in the quarter, we had great growth across all income cohorts, and our core customer really had our highest comp.\nSo we look at it and say we saw the traffic decelerate in that August, September timeframe. That was the peak of our restickering, those red stickers. That was the peak distraction for us. And then it was good to see traffic strengthen towards the end of the quarter, really on the backs of that Halloween and that great strength in Halloween. So we believe there was some broad-based retail traffic decel around back to school, some of the sticker shock around back to school. But as we got into the real core of what Dollar Tree does and does, we think, better than anyone, we saw the strength in our Halloween, and we're very excited about what Thanksgiving, Christmas, and all the seasons can do for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Heinbockel\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nAnd Mike, two quick ones. When you think about traffic or divergence between traffic and units, so sort of the idea traffic will be strong, units maybe to a lesser degree because you're basically trading people into higher price point items. Talk about that divergence in your mind. And then secondly, if the units are going to grow at a slower pace, how do you think about space allocation and replanogramming the stores over maybe the intermediate to longer term?\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nFirst of all, thanks, John. We'll always follow our customer on that. We believe that the customer is resonating incredibly well with multi-price. We're hearing that in the surveys we're doing. We're seeing it in how our customers are performing in the store and that real strength in the comp of that core customer.\nSo yes, when we look at the store, when we take multi-price, we'll take away sections of $1.25. And so your units will naturally decline there as you take that space and make that space more productive. So we do see some of that. But we believe the proof point we have from Break the Dollar was that you took up the price of the whole store. There were elements of the store that just didn't work, and our merchant team took the next buying cycles to really recover that.\nWhat we've seen here in this multi-price evolution and some of the restickering we did based on the inflationary cost environment is that the units have performed better, the traffic has performed better, and we're confident that we can continue to drive that value in our product across these price points and continue to give the customer exactly what they need. So we see that coming together very well for us, and we'll respond to the customer and their trends with how we set up the store.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the mix of multi-price as you think about next year. Just looking out, it does seem like you'll have more conversions.\nI would imagine you're still doing more merchandising around improving the multiprice mix. So how do you think the stores look from the standpoint of the multiprice offering as we think about next year? And then how does that play into the way that you are thinking about driving comp next year in terms of traffic versus ticket? Thank you.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, thanks, Ed. I mean, I really want to start with saying 85% of the store is still $2 or less. So we're still early in this multiprice game. And when you look at what the seasons have done, we're going to continue to benefit in those seasons from the multiprice assortment and we're really looking at everyday essentials and where we can benefit in the assortment there and the shift towards multiprice.\nWhere it ultimately goes, our customers will respond to us, and we'll respond to them in terms of building it out. But I know it's higher than where we are today, and it's something that we believe sets up a multi-year run where we're able to respond to our customers, wow them with new discovery, and not just at the seasons, but new discovery every day because multiprice contains something on a wow table for us or on an end cap that shows them something they couldn't believe they could get at that price, even though it's a price higher than $2. So we're delivering the everyday value with the majority of the store still at that $2 or less, and we're wowing the customer in what we bring into the multiprice assortment.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.\nPlease proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Curious if you could talk about Thanksgiving weekend and what you saw from a traffic versus ticket perspective. It sounded like you saw a pickup in traffic around the Halloween period. Curious what you saw Thanksgiving week and weekend. Then that 85% number, I think you're talking in terms of units, in terms of the percent of the store that's still $2 and below. What percent of sales should we think about being above that $2 level? And how does it split between discretionary and consumables? Thanks.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, Paul, let me clear up the first one. So first of all, it's sales dollars that are at the 85% of the store is $2 and less. That is on sales dollars. As we look at how the quarter has started, I said in my prepared remarks, we're really pleased.\nWe look at the strength of the seasons, the Thanksgiving, the setup for Christmas, what we've seen so far in Christmas. So we feel really good about the guide for the fourth quarter. We've got one period in, and we're feeling really good about where we sit.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking a question. I also have a two-part one. So just on the elasticity front, just curious on the categories you took pricing related to tariff risk and price increases. Just curious how that played out. And then if we do get tariff relief, how do you guys approach that, whether passing on those savings or letting it flow to the bottom line? Thank you.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, thanks, Rupesh. I mean, the elasticity has really come in as we've modeled it.\nIt's very manageable. It's really offset by the mix we see in the multi-price. But most importantly, the value perception is intact. Our customers responding across all income cohorts, core customers, new customers, the 60% of the new three million that have come in making more than $100,000. So we believe that the elasticity is very manageable. And then I do think it's important to go back to that Break the Dollar moment. What we saw there, it's a proof point. You can go back and look, see what happened with traffic. And now our performance, we believe, and what we're seeing in our numbers is better than that and gives us the confidence in the path we're on on this. As for the tariffs, I know it's been a lot in the news. We have, I think, one of the very best global sourcing teams in the business.\nThey are all over this. They've got great partners watching this. We'll see how it unfolds with the Supreme Court, and we'll take action from there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutmann with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Plyam\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, this is Zach Fadem on for Simeon. Thanks for taking your questions. Just a couple from our end. Back to the traffic question, is there a way you could compare your frequent and most loyal customers to those who are more episodic? And would you say there's a similar deceleration in traffic trends between both of those groups, or is there a gap in the trend?\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, when we break it down, we really look at more our sales across all those income cohorts.\nIt's really important to us to make sure that as we know multi-price skews and attracts more towards higher income, that we are committed to the base of our business, which is that core customer, that customer that makes around $60,000 a year. We were particularly pleased with how our comps performed at that core customer. They had our highest comps in that customer. So we think that our customer, whether you're new to Dollar Tree or you shop us several times a month, that you're finding what you need as you seek out affordability, you're finding exactly what you need at Dollar Tree.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I think we all understand that there was some internal disruption as you restickered product.\nBut with the negative traffic this quarter and the expectation to keep expanding MPP, should we just expect Q4 and next year to have a similar mix of traffic and ticket that we saw in Q3? In other words, all of the comp is primarily driven by ticket. Thanks.\nYeah, Scot, it's hard to say. We can go back, and we know what we saw in Break the Dollar. You saw the multiple quarters and how the traffic performed there. We believe this time around we were much more strategic. Back then, the only choice was raising everything to $1.25. And as I've mentioned, you had a healthy percentage of the store that just didn't work at that new level. And the merchant team had to go over several buying cycles and re-engineer product, renegotiate, and get product that did work and you saw what happened with traffic recovery.\nThis time, we were much more strategic in how we took that. We really feel that we have found the right value places to take price. And our customers responded. If you look at the value we took in Halloween or in Christmas, I mean, our customers responded incredibly well to that move. So I look at it and say, I think we were more strategic this time, or we at least had a more strategic opportunity available to us this time. And we'll see how the traffic plays out.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, and maybe one other thing, just to supplement, I think if you go back to the investment materials we laid out, I mean, that entire strategy is set up to drive higher sales in stores via productivity on the shelves, via the way we intend to market to customers, and based on the way we intend to run better stores. I think that entire setup really is organized to enhance the traffic and the ticket flow.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Michael, could you please check if you're self-muted?\n\nMichael Montani\n\nResearch Analyst, Evercore\n\nYes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was going to ask if you could share what the average selling price was in Q3 versus this time a year ago.\nAnd then, curious if you think that you'd be able to get that level of price increase again in 2026 to drive comp.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, our AUR right now, right about $1.50. When you look at that value over time, it's pretty remarkable considering what this company's done, what other prices have done. So we look at it and say, our customer is going to tell us with their comps, with their wallets, that we're hitting the right points in terms of value, convenience, and discovery. One of the things that we really turn to is that expanded, more relevant assortment. So yes, it comes at a higher ticket, but it's still an incredible wow for the customer. It fits their occasion, the purpose for their trip, and whether it's a great pack size for them that helps them or just an item that helps them celebrate and they love it.\nSo we feel that while the AUR moves up, it does so locked squarely into that value play for the customer.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nKeep in mind one other item is that obviously as our multiprice penetration increases, so that will also move AUR that is not price dependent. And I think if you looked at the supplementary materials and you look at how well the multiprice worked in Halloween this year, it'll give you a sense for the kind of benefit we might see going forward as we drive that multiprice harder.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector, Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just one quick clarification on corporate expenses. Did it come in a bit better than your prior expectations? If you can provide a bit more color there, that'll be really helpful.\nAnd then a quick one on next year. Given the trade down you have seen from middle- to higher-income consumers, what does the tax refund, the incremental tax refund next year, do to middle to high-income consumers' shopping behaviors in your mind? Thank you.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, I'll pick up on the first part, Stewart here. The SG&A did come in better than we expected. As we get ready to set ourselves up for next year and achieve some of the aggressive savings targets we've set up, we've been squeezing down on SG&A. Some of those savings came in a little bit faster than we had expected.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah. And then I'll take the second one. I look at the tax refunds of the OB3, Big Beautiful Bill. When you offer the best value in retail, you benefit when people have more money in their wallet.\nDollar Tree has the best value retail has, and we think we'll benefit as they get more money in their pocket.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Banya with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to ask about the consumables, the market share trends there from a unit perspective. They seemed quite strong in the first half, but really shifted in the third quarter here. I was just curious if you had any explanation of what you think is happening there. Is that attributable to the restickering impact or any other color on the market share trends there?\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, Kelly, the red dots is kind of how I'll answer that. It really peaked for us in this Q3. It was the mass distraction.\nI will tell you, though, as we've seen trends from our customer post that, we track via customer surveys, via scrapes of website and star ratings, and all that. The sentiment of our customer that really peaked negative in that August, September has improved every week. So the fewer mentions of pricing, more positivity, less negativity. We've been watching that, and every week that's gotten better. So we don't love that we had to create that environment for our customer. It was a necessary evil to continue to deliver for them and give them product at a value. But it is what it is, and it's behind us now. The restickering is basically done. You get a little bit as you take some pack away, but it's basically done. The distraction's behind us, and our stores and customers are responding very favorably.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. When you talked about that higher-income consumer trying to get them to visit more often with more frequency, I'm just wondering how you guys plan to go about that. Maybe, is it more stimulus from a marketing standpoint, or I don't know what other methods that you might be thinking of, but how do you get them to come more frequently? Thanks.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, we love that this customer's finding us. We want to create a very sticky relationship with them, and we believe it is the more relevant assortment. So continuing to wow them each season that they come up and for their everyday essentials with items they just can't believe they found.\nRemember, you don't come into Dollar Tree with a list and your head down, and I have to get this. You come in with your head moving around, looking at all the things that are wowing you. So that relevant assortment creates a sticky relationship, and then there is nothing more important than running better stores. Our store standards are on the move up, and we believe that as we continue to improve the in-store experience, those customers are going to want to come more and more often.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the last question. Just, it's impressive how you guys are gaining all the new customers and the info you gave us on that.\nJust help me understand gaining all these new customers at all these income cohorts versus negative traffic. How does that happen? Are there cohorts dropping out or coming a lot less frequently? And that's offsetting all these new customers that you guys have gotten to come to the stores? Maybe a little more color on what's happening there.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, Robbie, it's really a question of frequency. So you're driving new customers to the store, which is fantastic. I mean, 3 million new households. Yes, they're skewing a bit higher income, but the strength of our business is still in that core customer, their purchase frequency, and their comp dollars. We believe that these new customers come in, we can increase their trip frequency too when they find better-run stores and they find an assortment that keeps them coming back.\nSo right now, they're coming in because of a Halloween, or they're coming in for a great season, and then what they find in the store when they're there, in health and beauty, and in everyday essentials, that's what keeps them coming back. If you look at Dollar Tree compared to some of the folks we aspire to be, the difference is not in our ticket. The difference is in trip frequency. We believe we've got an opportunity to unlock increased trip frequency with these great newer trade-in customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobert Griffin\n\nManaging Director, Consumer Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you can expand a little bit more on Shrink and where you are in that journey of bending that line item?\nAnd then I don't think it was discussed at the investor day, but what is embedded in the multi-year outlook for Shrink? Is that elevated rates versus pre-COVID, or is it a return to 2019 rates?\nYeah, I'll start with that, with the focus we have. We learned a lot about Shrink from Family Dollar. Family Dollar has a higher Shrink threshold, if you will, and we were able to bend the curve over there. And so we've really reorganized how we're addressing Shrink at Dollar Tree. It's not as simple for us as it is other; we can't just go rip out a bunch of self-checkouts and improve our Shrink. We don't have self-checkout in any large capacity. So for us, it has to be leveraging training of our people, leveraging technology to address Shrink over time.\nAnd then in terms of how it builds, Stewart.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nSo Bobby, Stewart, we have built in some improvement in Shrink as we move forward. I mean, we've made these changes to people and process. We're investing money in our asset protection, and we expect that to bend the trend. So that is built into the forward expectations.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, thanks a lot. I have just a question on the SG&A line. In slide nine, you talk about the unit trend going from 100 to 89. So there's a clear benefit from running less units through the store on freight and handling expenses. But when we look at the core SG&A line, can we unpack the 160 basis point increase in SG&A?\nThen also looking ahead to Q4, how are you thinking about the complexion of both gross margins and SG&A in Q4?\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree\n\nYeah, so Chuck, Stewart, when you really look at SG&A in total, the big driver for SG&A increases is really in store payroll in that whole space. We do have some increases, as we said before, both in DNA based on store investments and also in general liability claims. Those are probably the big areas to think about. If I unpack the store payroll for you a little bit earlier in the year, we commented on the fact that first we were faced with some rate increases. A number of those were driven by state minimum wage increases.\nAnd second, we had decided at the beginning of this year that we would put some more hours back into the stores because we felt that if we invested some hours in stores, we could drive a better comp. Certainly, we set that out as an aggressive goal for the year: 3%-5% comp. We're obviously at the top end of that. The last piece, of course, is the tariff-related stickering activities, which is a pretty substantial add. So if you think about the increase in payroll, which again, the biggest driver of the SG&A, it was about a third, a third, a third. A third was the rate, a third was the increased investment in hours, and a third was stickering. Let me come back now to your unit point because I want to look forward to next year.\nIf you're thinking about next year, the restickering is sort of largely gone. So that piece is not going to be pushing on our P&L. In fact, that's a benefit. The rate increases, we believe that that rate's going to start to moderate, and that's going to help us next year. And then the last piece on the hour side, actually on the hour side, is exactly the point you've just made. The success of multi-price, in fact, allows us to move fewer units through the store, and that'll give us the flexibility to decide: do we take the units, do we take the hours down, or do we invest some more hours in running stores better? But I think it puts us in a better position overall. Hopefully, that gives you a good flavor for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session.\nI would now like to turn the floor back over to Mike Creedon for any closing comments.\n\nMichael Creedon\n\nCEO, Dollar Tree\n\nHey, thanks for joining us today, and we wish everyone a safe and healthy holiday season. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRobert Andrew LaFleur\n\nHead of IR, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's First Quarter fiscal 2024 results. With me today are Dollar Tree's Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling; and CFO, Jeff Davis.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the remarks that we will make today about the company's expectations, plans and future prospects are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.\nFor information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please see the risk factors, Business and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 20, 2024, our most recent press release and Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC.\nWe caution against reliance on any forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in today's earnings release available on the IR section of our website.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP results. Unless otherwise stated, we will refer to our financial results on a GAAP basis. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are against the same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website. Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I'd like to begin my remarks today by extending my heartfelt gratitude to members of our Dollar Tree community following the devastating tornado in Marietta, Oklahoma. While the tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center there, I'm especially thankful that no 1 was injured in our facility. I am also extremely proud of the resilience displayed by our team members in the aftermath of this tragic event.\nFortunately, our distribution network is flexible and while we expect to absorb incremental operating costs, we believe we will keep store level disruption to a minimum. The leadership team at Dollar Tree is also highly sensitive to the wider impact of this disaster on our associates, their families and the broader Marietta community. With this in mind, we set up a temporary site at a local hotel to help support our associates in their time of need.\nWe brought in food and other essential supplies such as batteries, chargers, diapers and toilet trees. Our associates have access to over $200,000 a in immediate response grants and mental health services. For everyone impacted by the recent situation in Marietta, I want to thank you for everything you've done during this difficult time. It's during these periods of adversity that the strength and character of our organization shines through.\nWhether it's dealing with natural disasters or important strategic decisions, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind. As I'm sure you saw in our announcement earlier today, we are initiating a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. The decision to explore strategic alternatives includes evaluating how each separate banner might appeal differently to different sets of owners.\nIt also includes evaluating whether accelerating Dollar Tree's growth and completing Family Dollars transformation might be best accomplished by separate dedicated leadership teams. Separating the 2 businesses could enhance the performance of each 1 individually and allow them both to reach their true valuation potential.\nLet me provide some additional background and context. We have been on a multiyear journey to transform this organization and fully unlock its intrinsic value. An important step in this process was our portfolio review and the decision to close 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores. Many of these stores had been underinvested in for years and the capital investment required to fix them could not deliver an acceptable rate of return.\nMoving forward with a streamlined portfolio should help accelerate Family Dollar's transformation and improve the long-term returns of the business. While we are working to transform Family Dollar, we continue to aggressively grow the Dollar Tree banner by expanding our multi-price offering accelerating our rate of new store openings and pursuing accretive transactions like our recent acquisition of up to 170 stores out of the $0.99 only bankruptcy.\nThese stores are highly complementary to the Dollar Tree banner and are expected to produce sales, profits and returns that are well above our portfolio average. We are pleased to bring these locations under the Dollar Tree banner and look forward to their openings later this year. Today, each banner is at a different stage of its respective journey and each has its own set of unique needs. This is why we believe now is the right time to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar so we can determine what is the proper operational and ownership structure to best support and enable its transformation.\nAt the same time, that should allow us to fully unlock the value of the Dollar Tree banner. In the end, we want to ensure that both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners have the right strategic operational and capital structures necessary to meet the evolving needs of their customers and to maximize value creation in each business.\nAs I said in my opening, our associates and the communities they serve are always top of mind for us. For 65 years, Family Dollar has played an incredibly important role in neighborhoods across America by helping families do more with less. This would not be possible without the dedication of our incredible Family Dollar associates. One of the priorities of this strategic review is to make sure that Family Dollar is properly positioned for long-term prosperity.\nAll that said, we are still in the very early stages of this review. We have not made any pre judgments regarding the eventual outcome of this process especially given the wide range of potential outcomes. As I'm sure you can appreciate, there is a lot of work to be done, and we do not intend to provide any further updates unless and until the Board has approved a specific course of action or determined that further disclosures are appropriate or necessary. I thank you in advance for your understanding on this manner.\nWith that, let's move on to our first quarter results. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 was at the higher end of our outlook range. These results reflect favorable freight costs and careful expense management during the quarter. You've heard me say many times that the 3 key fundamentals in retail are growth in transactions, sales per square foot and units. And I'm pleased to report all 3 of these metrics continue to move in the right direction.\nLet me now cover some key financial highlights from the quarter. On a consolidated basis, net sales increased 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Enterprise comp was 1% and as a 2.1% increase in traffic was partially offset by a 1.1% decline in average ticket. In both segments, comp growth was driven by traffic gains that were partially offset by lower average tickets. The average ticket declines reflected weaker discretionary demand, particularly in the Dollar Tree segment.\nLooking at performance by banner. Dollar Tree comps increased 1.7% on a 2.8% increase in customer traffic, partially offset by 1.1% decrease in average ticket. Dollar Tree's consumable comp was 7.4% and its discretionary comp declined 3.2% while a 7.4% consumables comp is respectable in its own right, it is worth noting that this came on top of a 6.9% consumables comp last year. On the other hand, this was the first discretionary comp decline.\nWe've seen at Dollar Tree since the first quarter of 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. Dollar Tree's quarter 1 comp came in below expectations because Easter was especially challenging for us this year. Easter is historically a major driver of discretionary demand -- in fact, to put things in perspective, Easter discretionary sales represent about 1% of our annual sales.\nFor the largest retailers, that figure is closer to 0.1%. Looked at another way, Easter is 10x more important to Dollar Tree than it is for other retailers. This year, in early Easter, combined with the extra week in our fourth quarter last year left us with a much shorter selling season. Also unusually cold and wet weather throughout much of the country negatively impacted the way many families celebrate this traditionally spring-oriented, outdoor centric holiday.\nIn fact, recent consumer research showed that Easter gatherings were down 20% this year and that 6 million fewer American households purchased Easter products in 2024. This dampened consumer demand across our seasonal discretionary assortment, which caters heavily to these types of celebrations. We also saw related softness in non-Easter discretionary categories like garden supplies, outdoor toys and other seasonal items.\nWhile the calendar shift was contemplated in our first quarter comp guidance, the unusual weather was not. Overall, the soft Easter highly influenced the monthly cadence of our quarter 1 comp. It's also important to note that this softness was Dollar Tree specific and concentrated in the 8 to 10 days prior to Easter. Comps before and after that, we're essentially in line with our quarterly expectations. All in, we believe Easter was a 150 basis point drag on Dollar Tree's first quarter comp. Despite this, Dollar Tree took meaningful consumable market share in the quarter with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 660 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 520 basis points.\nLast quarter, I announced the next phase of our multi-price strategy called More Choices. As part of this program, we are expanding our multi-price assortment by over 300 items at price points above $1.25 and approximately 3,000 Dollar Tree stores by year-end. Importantly, these multi-price items are being fully integrated into aisles throughout the store rather than concentrated in a single center store aisle.\nBefore I expand on this program, let me take a moment to reiterate what multiprice is and what it is not. Multi-price has never been about raising prices on existing items. It's about adding new items at new price points that are incremental to our core assortment. Multi-price offers our customers the high-quality products that they've come to expect at price points that represent a compelling value proposition in the categories that are most relevant to them.\nMulti-price is designed to complement our core $1.25 strategy, not replace it. Even as we expand our multi-price assortment, we expect that at least 80% of the items in any Dollar Tree store will remain at that entry level price point.\nNow back to the rollout. By the end of the quarter, we had converted roughly 10% of Dollar Tree stores to the new in-line multi-price configuration. To date, we are pleased with the performance of this latest group of stores, which are outcomping our $1.25 only in Dollar Trees stores. As we roll out our latest concept to 2,000 more stores over the balance of this year, we are proactively taking steps to minimize any operational disruption by using teams of dedicated third-party specialists to complete the conversions. I'm excited about our multi-price journey.\nPost-conversion comps are running at or above expectations at the vast majority of stores that we have transitioned. That said, there is a bit of a learning curve with multi-price as we evolve from our fixed price legacy. This is a new discipline for us and it will take us a little bit of time to fully build out our core competencies. But we're off to a good start. And so far, I'm pleased with the customer response to our new offerings.\nShifting over to Family Dollar. Top line performance in quarter 1 was in line with our expectations. Comps were up 0.1% as we cycled a 6.6% comp in quarter 1 of last year. Customer traffic increased 0.9%, which was partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in average ticket. Both traffic and ticket trends improved on a sequential basis as the multiple merchandising initiatives and growth strategies we've launched over the past several quarters continue to progress.\nFamily Dollar's consumable comp was up 1.4% and its discretionary comp was down 4.7%. While Family Dollars discretionary comp is still negative, it is worth pointing out that the underlying trend has gradually improved. The pace of mix shift towards consumables of Family Dollar has definitely slowed. And since quarter 1 of last year, our 2-year stack discretionary comp has improved by 1,000 basis points.\nWhile our lower income consumers continue to deal with inflation, higher interest rates and reduced government benefits. We are encouraged that the worst of the SNAP headwinds appear to be behind us. While lower SNAP benefits were a meaningful 280 basis point drag on Family Dollar's first quarter comp, this was a 200 basis point sequential improvement over the quarter 4 SNAP headwinds.\nSimilar to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar also continues to gain consumables market share with our dollar growth exceeding the market by 180 basis points and our unit growth exceeding the market by 80 basis points. Lastly, on Family Dollar, let me take a moment and update you on the portfolio optimization. We closed 506 underperforming Family Dollar stores in the first quarter. The remaining 90 or so stores we identified in the initial round of closures were closed in May.\nNone of the stores that closed in quarter 1 are included in our comp results, although any revenues and expenses from the time they were opened are included in our quarter 1 P&L. Before I turn things over to Jeff, I want to again emphasize that our operating performance in both segments remain strong.\nAt Dollar Tree, we continue to acquire new customers and gain market share as our next generation of multi-price resonates with a broader base of consumers. And at Family Dollar, we believe the decisive actions we took to solidify the portfolio will have a positive impact on operations and returns. As a more streamlined organization, I am confident that Family Dollar's best days are ahead of it. based on the wide range of growth initiatives that are in place.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nTreasurer & Senior Vice President, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning. I will start by discussing our first quarter results, after which I'll provide comments on our Q2 and fiscal 2024 outlook. Where applicable, I will focus on our adjusted results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in our earnings release.\nLet's begin by looking at the business on a consolidated basis. Net sales increased by 4.2% to $7.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was $436 million, a 3% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 45 basis points reflecting a 30 basis point increase in gross margin, offset by a 75 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A rate.\nGross margin improvement came from lower freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink. Adjusted SG&A increased primarily from temporary labor for Dollar Tree's multi-price rollout, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage. Adjusted Q1 SG&A this year exclude $17.5 million of severance and other store closure costs and a $2.5 million reversal of a legal accrual. Q1 last year excluded a $30 million legal accrual.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.3%. Adjusted net income was $312 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.43.\nMoving to our business segment results. Dollar Tree's net sales increased 5.9% to $4.2 billion. Operating income decreased 3% to $522 million. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points, driven by a 10 basis point increase in gross margin offset by a 120 basis point increase in SG&A rate.\nGross margin improved primarily from lower freight costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and elevated shrink SG&A expenses increased primarily due to temporary labor for the multi-price conversions, higher depreciation and amortization and sales deleverage.\nFamily Dollar's net sales increased by 2% to $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income was $51 million, a 32% increase from last year and adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points. The increase was all attributable to gross margin as the adjusted SG&A rate was flat at 23.7%.\nGross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by product cost increases and an unfavorable sales mix. Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory decreased by 2% or $103 million. On a related note, in the quarter, we recorded a $70 million loss related to the book value of inventory destroyed at our Marietta distribution center and a $47 million loss related to property and equipment destruction.\nGiven our expansive scale and breadth of operations, our insurance policies include significant property and inventory coverage above cost. Based on the catastrophic nature of this event, we expect these losses to be fully offset by insurance recoveries. As our recorded losses were fully offset by the insurance receivable, there was no net impact to the first quarter P&L.\nWith cash and cash equivalents of $618 million and long-term debt of $3.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our bank-defined leverage at quarter end stood at approximately 2.3x, which continues to underpin our investment-grade credit worthiness. Regarding cash flow, we generated $696 million from operating activities compared to $752 million last year.\nCapital expenditures were $472 million in the quarter versus $350 million last year reflecting accelerated new store openings and ongoing investments in growth and other initiatives. Notwithstanding the higher CapEx spending, we generated $224 million in free cash flow in the quarter compared to $402 million last year. Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, after investing in the growth of our business, we returned $310 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average price of $122 per share.\nAt quarter end, we had approximately $1 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Now let me provide some perspective on our second quarter and full year expectations. Our current outlook reflects the following: we expect to incur additional operating expenses related to the loss of our Marietta DC.\nThe EPS impact of incremental transportation and other costs is estimated to be approximately $0.10 in Q2 and approximately $0.20 to $0.30 on a full year basis. As more information on the costs associated with this disruption becomes available, we may revisit this outlook in subsequent quarters. The expected impact of freight, shrink, mix, and SNAP on our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains consistent with the expectations we outlined last quarter.\nAdditionally, given the relatively low level of our freight volume that is subject to spot rates, we believe our exposure to recently observed volatility in the global shipping markets is limited and may be partially offset by favorable domestic carrier cost. With that as a background, for the second quarter, we expect net sales will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion based on a comparable net sales growth in the low single digits for the enterprise, 2% to 4% for Dollar Tree segment and approximately flat for the Family Dollar segment.\nAdjusting for the stores that were closed as part of the portfolio optimization. We expect second quarter net sales for the Family Dollar segment to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. We expect adjusted EPS will be in the range of $1 to $1.10, which reflects the incremental operating expense associated with the loss of the Marietta DC.\nFor the full year, we still expect net sales to be in the range of $31 billion to $32 billion. Although at this point in time, we think we are more likely to be in the lower half of that range. We still expect comparable net sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the enterprise, the mid-single digits for Dollar Tree segment and the low single digits for the Family Dollar segment.\nAdjusting for stores closed as part of the portfolio optimization, we expect full year net sales for Family Dollar to decline by 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $6.50 to $7, again, reflecting the incremental operating expenses associated with the loss of Marietta.\nOur outlook for Q2 and the fiscal year does not include any severance or additional incremental costs related to the portfolio review or related workforce reductions. It also excludes any future share repurchases. In the interest of time, I will direct you to our supplemental financial presentation, which is available on our IR website for the remaining details that support our current guidance.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. We are pleased that we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS results towards the high end of our outlook range. At Dollar Tree, we overcame some Easter softness and remain focused on rapidly rolling out our next generation of multi-price stores.\nAt Family Dollar, we are taking the difficult but necessary steps to position the business for long-term prosperity. Change is never easy, and I couldn't be prouder of our 200,000 associates across Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for their ongoing commitment to their communities and the customers that they serve. I am truly honored to lead and be part of 1 of the best teams in retail.\nOperator, with that, Jeff and I are ready to take your questions.",

This is our heritage, and this is our future. One of our founders, Makan Brock, always spoke of running clean, bright and inviting stores that exceed our customers' expectations. With Dollar Tree as our sole focus, we can remain true to that vision and return to our roots while still competing and innovating in the marketplace in new and better ways than we could before.\nWith value, convenience and discovery, Dollar Tree offers just what the customer needs in today's value-seeking environment. By delivering on the fundamentals, we can drive the sales productivity and profitability necessary to create long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders.\nWith that, let's now turn to our results. 2024 ended strong as Dollar Tree's multi-price journey continued to build momentum and improvements in store standards and operational efficiency are creating the foundation for sustainable growth and value creation. Fourth quarter results reflect the positive impact of our expanded assortment with our newest multi-price offerings, especially in holiday categories, driving strong year-end sell-through.\nIn the current economic landscape, we continue to see value-seeking behavior across all customer groups. In recent weeks, many retailers reported that customers, particularly middle income customers, are shifting towards alternatives that present value. Dollar Tree is also seeing middle income shoppers who make up about half of our customer base, focusing more on value. At the same time, we are seeing stronger demand from higher income customers who increasingly see Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products.\nThis trade-in has helped to offset other headwinds. We believe our ability to continue gaining market share amid such challenging market conditions shows that consumers appreciate the discovery aspect of our unique assortment and our compelling value proposition. Dollar Tree's Q4 comp was 2%. The quarter got off to a slow start with the late Thanksgiving, but our merchandising teams delivered across the broader holiday season as customers responded positively to our multi-price holiday assortment. We are particularly gratified that our comp growth was balanced, with traffic up 0.7% and ticket up 1.3%.\nNot only were both positive measures, but ticket actually grew faster than traffic for the first time since Q4 of 2022 during the tail end of the anniversary impact from breaking the dollar. We are encouraged by the deceleration in consumables mix shift this quarter. which was supported by the strong performance of our expanded holiday assortment. Q4 consumables mix increased 60 basis points to 45.2%, which is an improvement over the average per quarter mix shift of roughly 200 basis points we've seen recently. Consumables comp was 4.2%, which was on top of a 10.8% comp last year. Discretionary comp was 0.4%, its first positive reading since Q4 of last year.\nMulti-price clearly provided a boost to our Q4 performance. And while we are still in the early stages of this journey, I'm pleased with the progress so far and excited about the opportunity still ahead. With that, let me share some highlights of how our expanded assortment boosted our Q4 results. First, as a reminder, our 3.0 stores are new or converted stores that offer our expanded multi-price assortment throughout the store. Other formats include 2.0, which have a smaller multi-price format that is concentrated in a single aisle, we call the Valley and our 1.0 stores, which are over 95% of the items are still at $1.25.\nSo in Q4, our in-line 3.0 stores saw a 220 basis point comp lift compared to other formats including a 40 basis point consumables lift and a 290 basis point discretionary lift. Compared to other formats, 3.0 stores also saw 20 basis point traffic lift and more importantly, a 200 basis point ticket lift. Our merchandising team worked tirelessly to improve and refine execution around our expanded assortment, especially in holiday categories. Across seasonal merchandise broadly, our 3.0 stores saw a 10 percentage point comp lift over other formats, including 30 points in Thanksgiving and 15 points in Christmas.\nIn everyday categories like textiles, electronics, apparel and toys, we saw comp lifts in the low to mid-teens. Toys in particular, was a big winner this season. And even in underperforming categories like books beauty and food that was more by design as we cut space allocations for these items to make way for more productive categories. We finished the year with approximately 2,900 3.0 format stores, including roughly 2,600 conversions and 300 new stores. While the number of 3.0 conversions this year fell a bit short of target, we continue to believe it is better to not rush and get them done right with the least amount of disruption for our customers and associates. To that end, we are targeting approximately 5,200 3.0 stores by the end of 2025, including 2,000 new conversions and 300 new stores.\nIn summary, we're pleased with the first year performance of our expanded assortment in our 3.0 stores. The traffic, ticket and sales lift that we saw is validating the investments we're making in our expanded assortment.\nBefore I wrap up the Q4 results, I should note that with the decision to sell Family Dollar, from an accounting perspective, our Dollar Tree segments are now reported as continuing operations and Family Dollar results are reported as discontinued operations. Net sales from continuing operations increased 0.7% to $5 billion, reflecting the solid comp performance and strong revenue contribution from noncomp stores, including the former $0.99 only portfolio offset by lapping the 53rd week of last year. Net sales from discontinued operations decreased 11.2% to $3.3 billion reflecting Family Dollar's 1.3% comp, the impact of store closings and the lapping of last year's 53rd week.\nTherefore, on a consolidated basis, net sales were $8.3 billion, which was at the high end of our $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion outlook range. I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about tariffs and give you a quick supply chain update. As a large retailer and significant importer, we have years of experience dealing with global trade variability. As discussed last quarter, we have multiple contingencies in place to address a varied tariff scenarios and mitigate the earnings impact of higher tariffs. These include negotiating supplier cost concessions, changing product specs dropping noneconomical items, moving country of origin; and lastly, exercising the flexibility multiprice gives us.\nWhile we are focused on limiting the financial impact of any new tariffs, we are equally committed to continuously delivering value and market leadership on the items we offer our customers and differentiating ourselves from our competitors across the retail landscape. Our strategies to diversify country of origin sourcing have been in place for some time now. We intend to remain flexible and nimble focusing our efforts on sourcing products via channels that deliver the lowest landed cost to us in order to maintain value continuity for our customers. This includes the optionality to shift sourcing to and from different countries within a relatively short time frame.\nFor example, given our anticipated 2025 imports, the expected net impact of the 10% China tariff that was announced on February 4, prior to any mitigation efforts would have been about $15 million to $20 million per month. Based on our mitigation efforts to date, we have offset more than 90% of this incremental cost, which is reflected in our current 2025 outlook. With respect to the additional tariffs proposed in March, which included an additional 10% on goods from China and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. We believe our potential pre-mitigation exposure is approximately $20 million per month. As we speak, our merchants are working to mitigate the impact of this latest round of tariffs. On top of that, we are evaluating the potential impact of any additional tariffs that can materialize and impact our sourcing outs.\nWe have not reflected the impact of the second round of tariffs in our 2025 outlook as the net impact will depend on the eventual policy and the degree, scope and timing of our mitigation efforts. The imposition of this year's tariffs has introduced uncertainty and volatility. But over the long term, we believe that our mitigation efforts can help us prevent sustained margin erosion. Finally, concerning our supply chain operations, we will be replacing the DC we lost in Marietta, Oklahoma, and we'll communicate our plans to you once they are finalized. In the interim, we will continue incurring additional stem mile and other related costs until a replacement is up and running.\nAs an immediate step to help ease some of our current network pressure and support our growing store base, prior to the closing of the sale, we plan to convert the Family Dollar distribution center in Odessa, Texas, to a Dollar Tree distribution center. In sum, we finished 2024 on a high note with strong execution at Dollar Tree. Our results reflected sales momentum powered by growing consumer acceptance of our expanded assortment. With the pen sale of Family Dollar, I am excited at the opportunity to return to Dollar Tree's roots and begin to unlock the full potential of this iconic retail brand.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jeff to through the details of our Q4 results, I'd like to welcome Stewart Glendinning to our team. We recently announced that Stuart will take over as CFO at the end of March. Stewart joined the company earlier this year as our Chief Transformation Officer, where he has been heavily immersed in the Family Dollar sale process and charting the future course for Dollar Tree as a stand-alone organization. After Jeff's Q4 recap, I've asked Stewart to share our 2025 outlook.\nFinally, I want to thank Jeff Davis for his partnership these past 2.5 years and for helping to ensure a smooth transition as Stewart assumes his new role.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nTreasurer & Senior Vice President, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning. I also want to extend my congratulations to Stewart. Having had the opportunity to work with Stewart over the past few months, I want to echo Mike's comments regarding what has been a smooth transition. Let me start with an overview of the changes in our financial reporting this quarter. Last June, we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives of Family Dollar, which ultimately resulted in the transaction we announced today. That process officially ended in the fourth quarter with the company's decision to pursue a sale and accordingly, Family Dollar was classified as discontinued operations. As such, our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results are reported on a continuing operations basis, which includes the results of the entry segment and corporate support and other. .\nFamily Dollar's results are reported as discontinued operations. In our earnings release this morning, we provided schedules of our 2024 quarterly and annual GAAP and non-GAAP results on a continuing, discontinued and consolidated basis. Unless otherwise stated, my comments today reference our adjusted results from continuing operations. Also for comparability purposes, please keep in mind that Q4 and FY 2023 included a 53rd week, which positively impacted revenue by approximately $560 million and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.35. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.11 from continuing operations and $0.18 from discontinued operations for total adjusted enterprise EPS of $2.29, which compares to our outlook range of $2.10 to $2.30.\nEnterprise results include a $19 million or $0.07 per share benefit from a MasterCard settlement in discontinued ops and a $25 million or $0.09 per share charge for an anti-dumping duty recorded and continuing operations. Neither of these items were contemplated in our fourth quarter outlook. After netting both items, enterprise adjusted EPS would have been $0.01 above the high end of our outlook range. Turning to results from continuing operations. Adjusted operating income was $628 million, a 15% decrease from last year. Adjusted operating margin declined 230 basis points as gross margin declined 130 basis points and adjusted SG&A rate increased 100 basis points.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate was 24.8% compared to 23.8%, reflecting higher nondeductible expenses for executive compensation and lower work opportunity tax credits in the current year. Adjusted net income was $455 million compared to $544 million. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.11, which includes the $0.09 impact from the antidumping duty.\nNow let me move to our fourth quarter results for the Dollar Tree segment. Adjusted operating income declined 12.1% to $768 million. Adjusted operating margin declined by approximately 220 basis points, reflecting a 130 basis point decline in gross margin and a 90 basis point increase and adjusted SG&A rate. Gross margin declined primarily from the loss of sales leverage, lower mark-on and higher shrink distribution and markdown costs partially offset by lower freight. Also note that Q4 cost of sales included the $25 million antidumping duty. Adjusted SG&A rate rose principally from higher depreciation and utilities expense and the loss of sales leverage, which was partially offset by general liability claims adjustments.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. On a continuing operations basis, total inventory increased $176 million to $2.7 billion on higher mark-on and inventory receipts as we expanded our multi-price assortment. We ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. On the cash flow statement for continuing operations on a full year basis, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operating activities at capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and delivered $893 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with no borrowings under our revolver, no commercial paper outstanding and bank-defined leverage below 2.5x. Last week, we extended the maturity of our $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility to 2030 from 2026.\nAdditionally, we closed on a new $1 billion 364-day revolver ahead of the main maturity of our $1 billion, 4% senior notes. We believe we have ample funding capacity between cash on hand and availability under these credit facilities to meet our near-term debt obligations and provide for the ongoing capital needs of the business. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $404 million, including excise tax. At the end of the year, we had approximately $952 million remaining under our existing share repurchase program.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Stewart.\n\nStewart Glendinning\n\nThank you, Jeff. Now let me provide our current perspective on fiscal 2025. With the pending sale of Family Dollar, 2025 will be a transitional year for Dollar Tree as a stand-alone business. We will be working to separate Family Dollar while simultaneously focusing on driving growth and operating improvements in Dollar Tree. Prior to the closing of the sale, continuing operations or what we are calling RemainCo will be burdened with the full cost of corporate shared services after the sale closes, which we expect will be in June 2025, a transition services agreement, or TSA, will go into effect. This agreement will help offset the shared cost burden until such time as these costs are fully transitioned to the new owners, a process which should unfold throughout 2025 and into 2026.\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2025, we expect strong top line growth from the Dollar Tree banner with sales being positively impacted by multi-price expansion, operating improvements in our stores new store growth and the continuing ramp-up of our recently opened stores, especially the former $0.99 only portfolio. Taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal year 2025 sales will be in the range of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion based on comparable store sales growth of 3% to 5%. We expect a modest improvement in gross margin based on the mitigation actions we've taken to date on implemented tariffs.\nThat said, the tariff situation remains volatile and any additional tariffs or unforeseen waterfall effects from the already announced tariffs could affect this assumption. Keep in mind Mike's comments about our ability to mitigate those tariffs over time. Outside of tariffs, we're forecasting favorability in markdown and freight with a partial offset from higher distribution costs related to incremental D&A from our supply chain investments and additional stem mile and other costs from losing the Marietta DC. Our freight cost outlook is positive across ocean and both inbound and outbound ground.\nFor SG&A, I'll talk about Dollar Tree segment separately from corporate support and other. Dollar Tree's adjusted SG&A rate in 2024 was 23.8%. In 2025, we expect deleverage of approximately 50 to 80 basis points. This is coming from higher store payroll related to our investments in additional hours and state-mandated minimum wage increases, management incentive compensation, D&A related to our elevated 2024 and 2025 CapEx investments as well as repair and maintenance as we continue to improve store standards. Our corporate adjusted SG&A in 2024 was approximately $550 million. We expect this to grow by approximately 20% in 2025. The largest contributor to the year-over-year increase is IT spending as we move systems off legacy platforms and onto the cloud, followed by payroll from merit increases and incentive comp and D&A.\nUnder the TSA that I mentioned earlier, we expect to receive approximately $95 million in the last 6 months of 2025 for services provided to Family Dollar over the second half of the year, and a similar amount next year. While we will receive TSA income in connection with the cost of supporting family dollar for the second half of the year, we will incur these costs over the entire year. This negatively impacts our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.30 to $0.35 given the expected timing of the deal closing. On a normalized basis, had we received TSA payments for the full year, our net corporate costs at RemainCo would be lower and our adjusted EPS would be $0.30 to $0.35 higher than the outlook we are providing. Over the next several years, we expect absolute corporate SG&A dollars will go down as overhead costs permanently shift to Family Dollar's new owners. Our corporate infrastructure adjusts to the level needed to properly support a single banner, stranded costs go away and the TSA runs its course.\nWe are targeting a reduction in our adjusted corporate SG&A rate of approximately 100 basis points over the medium term. Finishing out the P&L, we expect net interest and other income of approximately $115 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 25.2% and 216 million shares outstanding, which does not reflect any share repurchases. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $5 to $5.50, which compares to last year's $5.10. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including approximately 400 new Dollar Tree store openings.\nWith respect to cash, we started the year with $1.3 billion on the balance sheet. -- and expect to receive approximately $800 million of net proceeds from the Family Dollar sale. On top of this, we expect tax benefits from losses on sale to be approximately $350 million accretive on a cash flow basis. Our capital allocation priorities remain investing in growing the business, then returning excess cash to shareholders. with our preferred vehicle to date having been share repurchase.\nIt is reasonable to assume that we will be back in the market repurchasing shares this year. Our balance sheet is strong. For this reason, we expect to come to market with a new debt offering following our May debt maturity and the closing of the Family Dollar sale. In the near term, we expect first quarter net sales to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion based on comparable net sales growth in the 3% to 5% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.25.\nIn summary, 2025 is going to be a transitional year. With the sale of Family Dollar, we can fully focus on unlocking value at Dollar Tree, we had a solid 2024 and we feel good about many parts of our business heading into 2025. We're optimistic about the top line, and we're addressing cost pressures on several fronts with tariffs being at the top of that list. We feel great about our cash position and our ability to generate meaningful levels of cash going forward. With a solid balance sheet and prudent CapEx commitments, we should have the ability to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders this year and into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Creedon\n\nEVP of U.S. Stores, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stewart. This is a pivotal time at Dollar Tree. We are shifting our long-term operational focus away from an integrated 2-banner model. With the sale of Family Dollar, our leadership team can focus all our energy and resources on growing Dollar Tree. I strongly believe selling Family Dollar and returning to our roots with an expanded assortment at Dollar Tree has created material value. Dollar Tree remains one of the best growth stories in retail and the separation of the 2 businesses will allow us to move forward with a single-minded focus of driving growth and profitability. As Stewart indicated, 2025 is going to be a transition year as we pivot to operating Dollar Tree as a stand-alone entity. After 2025, on a go-forward basis, we will drive top line results by growing comp and opening new stores. We expect increased sales productivity will allow us to expand gross margin, begin leveraging SG&A and grow EPS. Most importantly, by returning a meaningful level of cash to our shareholders, we can leverage that EPS growth even more.\nI'd like to close with a shout out to the entirety of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar teams. They have worked masterfully and tirelessly on behalf of our shareholders and our customers. I could not be more honored to count myself among them.\nAnd with that, we're ready to take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.\n\nRobert Andrew LaFleur\n\nHead of IR, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's third quarter results. With me today are Dollar Tree's Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling and CFO, Jeff Davis.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the remarks that we will make today about the company's expectations, plans and future prospects are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.

We caution against reliance on any forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP results. Unless otherwise stated, we will refer to our financial results on a GAAP basis.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today are for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and are against same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome everyone joining us on the call today. In brief, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our teams and continued execution towards our business transformation, third quarter results were well within our expected range.\nIn a challenging retail environment where the accumulating pressures of inflation, reduced government benefits and depleted savings have negatively affected lower-income consumers, our top line performance outpaced most of our peers. We accomplished this by taking market share in both segments, which we believe reflects the initial impact of our investments and transformation initiatives.\nDespite Family Dollar softer comps and $0.05 per share of unexpected costs from the previously announced voluntary recall of OTC and other products, we delivered $0.97 of EPS. Our sales momentum continues to be mostly traffic driven, as we attract new customers and gain both unit and dollar market share.\nIn the last 12 months, we have added 4.3 million new customers at Dollar Tree and 2.3 million new customers at Family Dollar. Importantly, most of these first-time customers come back to shop with us multiple times after their first visit. In fact, our loyal customers are now the third largest retail customer base in the United States.\nAs importantly, Dollar Tree is attracting customers from a broader range of income levels. Most of our new customers over the past year have household incomes over $125,000 and this income demographic, was a significant contributor to Dollar Tree's quarter 3 comp growth.\nFamily Dollar, our price value perception remains strong after last year's price investments, which we cycled in July. That said, Family Dollar fell short of our quarter 3 comp expectations.\nSimilar to what other retailers have reported, we experienced softening trends throughout the quarter, particularly in October as lower income consumers responded to the accumulated impact of inflation and reduced government benefits, we saw a notable back in spending, particularly in higher-margin discretionary categories.\nI will now review some of our third quarter highlights. For the third quarter, consolidated basis, we delivered a 5.4% increase in our net sales to $7.3 billion. This was driven by comp growth of 3.9% with traffic up 4.7% and average ticket down a little less than 1%. Operating income came in at $301.7 million, which resulted in EPS of $0.97, including the negative $0.05 impact from the OTC recall.\nIn the Dollar Tree segment, our comp was up 5.4%, with traffic increasing by 7% and average ticket decreasing by 1.5%. We are especially pleased with these results as they come on top of an 8.6% comp last year.\nOur consumable comp was up 11.1% and discretionary was up 1.1%. We believe the consumable strength at Dollar Tree this quarter as well as our strong multiyear discretionary comp shows customers are embracing our compelling value proposition in this strained economic environment.\nAccording to Nielsen, Dollar Tree gained an impressive 30 basis points of consumables market share in the third quarter as our unit volume grew 6%, while market unit volume declined.\nIn the Family Dollar segment, our comp was up 2%, with traffic increasing 1.4% and average ticket increasing 0.7%. Our consumable comp was especially strong at 6.2%, while discretionary was down meaningfully at 12.5% particularly in categories like home decor, electronics and toys.\nIn our view, these trends underscore how lower income households are under increasing -- stress and directing their spending towards needs-based goods.\nWhile traffic and ticket were both positive for the quarter, results did soften substantially. We moved through the quarter with average ticket turning negative in October as our customers pulled back and we realize the adverse impact of the OTC recall. Even with these external challenges, Family Dollar grew market share in consumables with both unit and dollar growth exceeding the market by wide margins.\nAlthough our low prices enable us to operate from a position of strength in consumables, our lower-income customers at Family Dollar have been especially pressured by reductions in government SNAP benefits. Nationwide, third quarter SNAP benefits were down 23% on a year-over-year basis, which was much more than the 5% reduction in quarter 1 or the 16% reduction in quarter 2.\nTiming-wise, the month-by-month deceleration in our quarter 3 comps matched the progressive reductions in national SNAP payments throughout the quarter.\nIn addition to pressure from lower SNAP payments, Family Dollar's comps were negatively affected by lower tax refunds this year. That said, I believe that the wide range of growth initiatives we have in place will help us maintain our momentum relative to the competition.\nAs a value retailer, we're uniquely positioned to meet customers' needs in a challenging economic environment. We remain focused on the factors that we can control, and we'll continue to navigate as best we can around those that we don't.\nNow let me take a few minutes to update you on our transformation journey. Our merchandising, IT and supply chain initiatives are on time and on budget, and we are pleased with our progress to date.\nAt Dollar Tree, we're ahead of schedule on our multi-price journey. Our Dollar Tree assortment is now available in 4,500 stores, and we are on track to finish the year with more than 4,900. Our Dollar Tree frozen and refrigerated assortments are now in 6,500 stores, significantly ahead of our original year-end target of 5,500. Customers are clearly responding to our expanded multi-price assortment as our research shows us that 17% of U.S. households have purchased a multi-price product from a Dollar Tree store at least once in the past 12 months.\nImportantly, these customers are adding multi-price products on top of their traditional baskets. For example, in quarter 3, the average multi-price basket included 2.3 multi-priced items and 11.6% traditional $1.25 items.\nAt Family Dollar, we completed our planogram resets by November as scheduled in [ pruning ] and expanding our product assortment, while increasing our shelf profile and merchandising to [ 7 8 ] inches across the portfolio. We're on track to renovate more than 1,000 Family Dollar stores by year-end. We have now upgraded 1,600 Family Dollar stores to our H 2.5 rural and extra small box formats.\nIn quarter 3, private brand penetration at Family Dollar reached 14%, a quarter ahead of schedule, and we -- to hit our 20% target by 2026. We are also on track to add over [ 20 ] new SKUs to our family wellness product line and new private brand SKUs in total by the end of December. Within that same time frame, we also expect to complete our conversion of 300 control brands to private brands.\nIn real estate, we opened 197 new stores in quarter 3, and we are on track to meet our target of 600 to 650 new stores this year.\nIn -- we are preparing to implement our streamlined delivery process for stores serviced by our Matthews, North Carolina distribution center with rotor carts and liftgate trailers starting next month. We have been testing our rotor carts and the feedback has been extremely positive. We remain on schedule for all of our distribution centers to be using rotor carts by the end of 2027.\nAcross our teams, the investments we've made in our people, including increased wages in key markets, simplified work at the store level and increased communications throughout the company are driving meaningful improvements in store turnover and associate satisfaction.\nAdditionally, as we prepared for our busiest season of the year, I'm proud to report that our annual National Hiring Day in mid-October was a huge success. We hired nearly 14,000 -- associates to work in our stores for [ different ] holiday season, an all-time record for this event.\nWhile we still have a lot of work to do in this transformational journey, I am pleased with what we've accomplished to date. We are focused on our plans to accelerate sales and grow earnings, and I remain confident in our ability to execute this ambitious undertaking.\nThat said, this journey also needs to be dynamic and adapt to changing market conditions and our learnings along the way. We believe being thoughtful about our store portfolio will help enhance our results.\nTo maximize value creation, we need to periodically reevaluate our portfolio in terms of current market conditions, individual store performance and overall portfolio considerations.\nTo this end, we have initiated a comprehensive review of our Family Dollar portfolio to address underperforming stores that are not aligned with our transformative vision for the company. This will involve, among other things, identifying stores as candidates for closure, rebannering for relocation with the goal of ensuring that each assets under the Family Dollar banner is delivering its full value for our shareholders on a sustainable basis.\nI am a strong believer in the Family Dollar brand and what it means to our customers and associates in thousands of communities across the country. Going forward, we need to ensure that the Family Dollar portfolio is well positioned for success and meets the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates. We believe that this action will fortify our base, strengthen our brand and allow Family Dollar to achieve its full growth potential.\nJeff will now review our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nTreasurer & Senior Vice President, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments both generated higher levels of customer traffic, unit volume and increased market share. Overall, we generated 5% more gross profit dollars in the third quarter than we did last year as consumers continue to respond positively to our growth initiatives.\nConsistent with prior quarter trends, sales mix continued to shift towards consumables. This trend was more pronounced at Family Dollar, where our third quarter consumables mix reached an all-time high of 82%.\nLooking at the business on a consolidated basis. Net sales increased 5.4% to $7.3 billion. Operating income declined 20.9% to $301.7 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points, which was a substantial trend improvement versus the first 2 quarters of the year. The contraction in Q3 operating margin was driven by a 15 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 125 basis point increase in SG&A rate.\nGross margin contracted primarily from higher shrink, unfavorable product mix, increased distribution costs and markdowns from the OTC recall. This was partially offset by lower freight costs.\nWhile still elevated across both banners, shrink results were mostly in line with our expectations. We have now completed physical inventory checks across more than 90% of our stores with a balance set for completion in January.\nSG&A expenses expanded primarily from ongoing labor investments in our stores, IT costs, depreciation and facility costs. Our effective tax rate was 21.8% versus 23.4%. Our tax rate was favorable versus expectations as higher work opportunity tax credits and lower net state taxes were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses.\nNet income was $212 million and diluted EPS was $0.97 versus $1.20. The net impact of the OTC recall was approximately $0.05 per share.\nAt the business segment level, Dollar Tree's net sales increased by 6.6% to $4 billion. Operating income declined 3.4% to $482.7 million. And operating margin compressed approximately 125 basis points driven by a 55 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 70 basis point increase in SG&A rate.\nGross margin contracted primarily from higher product costs, distribution center costs and shrink. These were partially offset by lower freight and sales leverage and occupancy cost.\nSG&A expenses expanded principally from store labor investments, minimum wage increases and facility costs. These were partially offset by sales leverage.\nFamily Dollar's net sales increased by 3.9% to $3.3 billion. Operating income declined $47.9 million to a loss of $66.3 million. Operating margin compressed 140 basis points on a 20 basis point increase in gross margin and a 160 basis point increase in SG&A rate.\nGross margin increased primarily from lower freight, partially offset by higher shrink, markdowns related to the OTC recall and sales mix. SG&A expenses increased primarily from labor investments, minimum wage increases, facility costs, costs related to the OTC recall and depreciation.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q3 2023 and Q3 2022. Inventory decreased by 2.5%. As we work through our shipments of seasonal imports, we expect a meaningful improvement in our inventory position by year-end.\nThird quarter capital expenditures were $541.4 million versus $391.2 million, reflecting elevated investments in new store openings, renovations, supply chain and IT. Free cash flow improved $142.1 million versus the third quarter last year. This improvement comes despite a challenging macro environment and the accelerated investments to support our multiyear growth strategy.\nFor the 9 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $299.1 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable.\nIn the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares for $252.3 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.35 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $444.6 million compared to $439 million.\nYou'll recall last quarter, we announced our new commercial -- program as an additional source of liquidity to manage our working capital needs. At quarter end, we had $230 million outstanding under this program.\nDuring the third quarter, we also implemented a new supply chain finance program. Participation in this program is voluntary for our suppliers and provides them with additional flexibility to finance payments due from Dollar Tree. This process will be managed by a third-party financial institution. At quarter end, our leverage as defined under our revolving credit agreement was 2.53x.\nNow let me provide some perspective into our sales and EPS expectations for the fourth quarter and its impact on our full year outlook. Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors and expectations. Consistent with our prior expectations and the patterns we have seen throughout the year, we expect shrink trends will remain unfavorable in the fourth quarter. [indiscernible] comps are expected to remain soft, reflecting the unfavorable macro environment for low-income households, continued discretionary weakness and elevated promotional activity in the market.\nOn the Plus side, we expect continued strength at the Dollar Tree banner, as consumers embrace our compelling value proposition and multi-price strategy in addition to incremental freight savings. With that background, we expect net sales for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion based on low single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise, supported by a mid-single-digit increase at Dollar Tree and a minus 1% to plus 1% comp at Family Dollar.\nAs a reminder, last year's Family Dollar comp accelerated meaningfully throughout the year, most notably in the back half as we began our price and labor investments and launched our transformation initiatives. Our Family Dollar comp results for Q3 and outlook for Q4 reflect these tougher comparisons.\nWe estimate fourth quarter diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.58 to $2.78. For the fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week, we expect sales in the range of $30.5 billion to $30.7 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales at the enterprise level, supported by a mid-single-digit comp at Dollar Tree and a low single-digit comp at Family Dollar.\nWith respect to EPS, we believe that higher sales at Dollar Tree, incremental savings and freight and proactive expense controls will allow us to offset lower revenue expectations at Family Dollar. We are tightening our full year GAAP EPS outlook to a range of $5.81 to $6.01, including the $0.12 legal reserve we took in the first quarter. We still expect selling square footage to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted.\nOther considerations in our 2023 outlook include the following no incremental share repurchases. Depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $840 million to $845 million. Net interest expense should be approximately $30 million for the fourth quarter or approximately $110 million for the full year. We are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 24% for the fourth quarter and approximately 23.5% for the full year.\nWe expect 218.4 million diluted shares for the fourth quarter and 220 million diluted shares for the full year. We expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion with approximately 40% allocated towards maintenance CapEx and the balance toward growth initiatives.\nFinally, our Q4 and full year outlook does not include any potential impact from the optimization review of the Family Dollar portfolio that Rick outlined in his remarks. We expect the review process will take several months, and we will update you on our progress no later than our Q4 call in March.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Similar to other retailers you've heard from this earnings season, we are seeing more macro pressures than we did earlier in the year, particularly among our lower-income consumers. Nonetheless, I'm encouraged by our market share momentum and am confident in our outlook for the balance of the year.\nAcross our enterprise, we are making good progress on our transformation initiatives. As I've said before, we benchmark our operating performance on growing traffic, units and sales per square foot. All three of these metrics are heading in the right direction.\nWith the steps we're taking to optimize our Family Dollar portfolio, we want to be better positioned to meet the financial and operating objectives of our organization and the expectations of our valued customers and associates.\nRelative to our competition, we want to operate from a position of strength at both banners. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the months ahead.\nAnd since we're in the midst of the important holiday season, I also want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 200,000 associates for their dedication in support of our continued growth as an organization.\nOperator, with that, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Bob LaFleur, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRobert Andrew LaFleur\n\nHead of IR, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Dollar Tree's second quarter results. With me today are Dollar Tree's Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling; and CFO, Jeff Davis. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some of the remarks that we will make today are about the company's expectations, plans and future prospects and are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please see the risk factors, business and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2023, our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, our most recent press release and Form 8-K and other filings with the SEC. We caution against reliance on any forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nAlso, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in today's earnings release available on the IR section of our website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, we will refer to our financial results on a GAAP basis.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons discussed today for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 are against the same period a year ago. Please note that a supplemental slide deck outlining selected operating metrics is available on the IR section of our website. Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. Given the number of callers who would like to participate in today's session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. I'd now like to turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. I'd like to welcome all of you that have joined our call this morning. I am sure that many of you had a chance to attend our investor conference in June. I hope the information we presented was valuable to you and that you left the event with a better understanding of the key growth strategies that we have in place to deliver $10 or more EPS by 2026.\nI am confident that the team has identified the right levers to unlock the true value of our business. We are making good progress and continue to act with urgency to accelerate the pace of improvement in our merchandising, store operations, supply chain and IT infrastructure. Our renewed merchandising efforts represent a major opportunity to unlock value. We outlined our multi-price journey at Dollar Tree, detailed our real estate and merchandising initiatives at Family Dollar and reviewed our plans to improve store standards across the enterprise.\nWe have also launched efforts to drive sales productivity and increase operating efficiency like simplifying the truck unloading process and improving in-stock levels. You heard me say many times that retail is all about growing units, growing transactions and growing sales per square foot. When these retail fundamentals move in the right direction, everything else follows.\nI am pleased to report that all 3 are heading in the right direction for us. For the past 2 quarters, both segments posted positive unit growth in consumables, while the market has been negative. Second quarter traffic was up over 3% at Family Dollar and nearly 10% at Dollar Tree. The fourth consecutive quarter of growth at Family Dollar and the second for Dollar Tree. And finally, sales per square foot is up 4% at Family Dollar and 6% at Dollar Tree.\nWhen it comes to our momentum in these key retail fundamentals, our ongoing merchandising efforts and the investments in labor and stores are paying dividends and setting the stage for everything else to follow. Now let me review some of our second quarter highlights. A little later, Jeff will provide a more detailed review of our results and update you on our outlook for the balance of the year.\nFor the quarter, on a consolidated basis, we delivered an 8.2% increase in sales to $7.3 billion, with 6.9% enterprise comp growth and $287.8 million of operating income, which led to EPS of $0.91. In our Dollar Tree segment, our 7.8% comp was driven by 9.6% more traffic, with a modest offset from average ticket. Dollar Tree's momentum remained strong with this quarter's comp coming in on top of a 7.5% comp last year.\nMeanwhile, the Family Dollar segment continues to make good progress in its operational turnaround. The second quarter comp of 5.8% was nicely balanced between 3.4% more traffic and 2.3% average ticket growth with the strong comp trends being supported by our improved price position and merchandising efforts. While the challenging macro environment continues to pressure our sales mix in both segments, I am pleased with the gains in traffic, new customers and market share.\nRegarding the industry-wide shift in consumer purchasing behaviors to consumables, we believe this is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment and continuing rotation to a prepandemic balance after years of elevated spending across discretionary categories. We believe we are winning in consumables as more customers come to see Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as the compelling destinations for value.\nAt Dollar Tree, our multi-price strategy provides flexibility to respond to changing customer needs. At Family Dollar, our improved price image and wide range of merchandising initiatives are clearly resonating with consumers. In this environment, consumers from all income levels are increasingly seeking value.\nWe are well positioned to capture incremental share of wallet when higher income consumers respond to our strong price value proposition and when lower income customers concentrate their spending on needs-based consumables. This is particularly true across food and other consumables where value-oriented retailers are taking unit and dollar share. As a result, food categories are disproportionately driving sales momentum across the value retail landscape.\nDollar Tree and Family Dollar are no exception. Our food business is especially well positioned in the current environment, and we are seeing extremely high volume growth across our frozen and center store food categories. There is also growing evidence that consumers are seeking value through private brands, expanding and improving our private brand assortment will be a significant growth vehicle for us going forward.\nTo this end, the private brand expansion program at Family Dollar remains on track. This year, we launched over 125 and private brand items, which we will further accelerate when our new family wellness and vitamin products hit store shelves in the fourth quarter. We are already seeing encouraging results across our private brands with second quarter penetration expanding by 55 basis points, units sold growing by 4% and private brand comps increasing over 15%. New customers are the lifeblood of retail and a critical part of driving traffic and market share.\nIn the past year, we have added nearly 5 million new customers across both segments with 2.6 million of these customers having a household income over $125,000. Importantly, our research tells us that a very high percentage of these new customers come back visiting an average of 5x in the year following their initial trip. In fact, we now rank in the top 10 retailers measured by annual new customer activations. These positive traffic and new customer trends are leading to strong market share gains.\nFor the second quarter in a row, both segments gained market share in consumables and as our unit volume grew while the market's unit volume shrink. According to Nielsen data, our second quarter consumable unit volume growth outpaced the market by over 1,100 basis points at Dollar Tree and 530 basis points at Family Dollar, with both segments extending their margin of outperformance from last quarter.\nShifting from our recent sales performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on several key initiatives across our company. In merchandising, we have increased our Dollar Tree us target to 4,900 stores by year-end, up from 4,300 stores that we articulated in June. At the end of the second quarter, our Dollar Tree Plus assortment was available in over 3,600 locations and the $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated assortment was available in nearly 5,600 stores.\nAt Family Dollar, we are on track to complete planogram resets at all of our stores by November, and we are pleased with the sales lift from these resets so far. In real estate, we remain on pace to hit our target of 600 to 650 new store openings this year with roughly 2/3 of those coming in the back half of the year. We also continue to make progress with our emerging formats at Family Dollar.\nWe completed 271 2.5 renovations bringing the total number of 2.5 locations to 830. We opened or converted 90 Family Dollar stores under our rural combo format. Overall, we are on track to complete at least 1,000 Family Dollar renovations by year-end. In supply chain, Mike Kindy and his team are investing in temperature control, across our distribution center network. Adding full temperature control to our DCs improves the work environment for our associates and drives improved operating performance.\nIt also drives efficiency by reducing cross-stocking expenses and increasing flexibility to store the full range of OTC HBA products. We recently expanded temperature controls at 2 additional DCs, which brings us to 4 in total. By year-end, we expect to upgrade 8 additional DCs with the balance rolled out by the end of 2024.\nWhile still in its early days, we continue to make good progress on our ROTO Cart rollout. Beta testing on ROTO Cart deliveries is currently underway, and we are on track for our D.C. and Matthews, North Carolina to be ROTO Cart-enabled by the end of this year.\nMoving on to IT. We're also making good progress on needed upgrades to our infrastructure, particularly our new store and inventory management systems. Meanwhile, our new warehouse and transportation management systems are progressing through their development stages with rollouts anticipated to begin early next year.\nWith the continued focus on our people, we saw double-digit improvements during the second quarter in employee turnover and store vacancy levels across both segments as the investments we are making in store level wages, benefits and elevated standards begin to yield clear intangible results. As I mentioned at our investor conference, we had a significant number of stores that don't open on time or close early due to staffing shortages.\nI'm happy to report that we saw a measurable improvement in this area during the second quarter at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. If we eliminated all 8 openings and early closings, it could add 1.5 points to our overall comp. In summary, when it comes to the factors that we can control, we continue to execute at a high level. As our recent sales performance shows consumers are clearly responding to our merchandising initiatives.\nAt the same time, Mike Creedon and his team are acting with urgency to upgrade our store conditions and improve operational consistency across our store fleet. We are making the investments we need to make to accelerate our top line performance, generate greater operating efficiencies and and improve profitability. We've built a strong cultural foundation as an organization, and we are focused on delivering better results for all our key constituents including our more than 200,000 associates.\nAnd speaking of our associates, we've just spent the last 2 weeks meeting with our field leadership at our headquarters here in Virginia. A team of more than 1,300 leaders who represent more than 200,000 associates and the energy coming out of those sessions was amazing. Our people are the key to a great customer experience, and I am so grateful for the progress we've made in our turnaround efforts over such a short period of time.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and outlook for the balance of the year.\n\nBradley Bingham Thomas\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to generate strong top line results across both segments, driven by growth in customer traffic, unit volume and an accelerating market share. We continue to have a favorable view of the current operating environment. Our top line performance was not driven by any material increase in promotional intensity.\nWhile our sales mix continues to shift towards consumables, we generated more gross profit dollars in the second quarter than we did last year. We also remain resolute in our strategy to make the necessary investments in stores, IT, supply chain and our people.\nOn a consolidated level, operating income declined 43.1% to $287.8 million and operating margin compressed by 360 basis points. This was driven by a 220 basis point decrease in gross margin and a 130 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lap the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix product cost inflation and elevated shrink.\nSG&A expenses expanded primarily from wage investments, incentive compensation, general liability claims, and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by leverage from increased comp sales and lower stock compensation expense.\nNotably, the impact of general liability claims was $0.07 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24% versus 24.2% last year as higher work opportunity tax credits were partially offset by higher nondeductible expenses. Net income was $20.4 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.91 versus $1.60 a year ago.\nAt a business segment level, Dollar Tree's operating income declined 27.8% to $397.8 million and operating margin compressed 510 basis points. This was driven by a 400 basis point decline in gross margin and a 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from lower merchandise margin as we lapped the margin benefit from last year's $1.25 rollout and from unfavorable sales mix, product cost inflation and elevated shrink.\nThese were partially offset by comp sales leverage against occupancy costs. SG&A expenses expanded principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, general liability claims, utility costs and repair and maintenance costs for improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.\nFamily Dollar's operating income declined 78.5% to $11.8 million and operating margin compressed 140 basis points. This was led by a 30 basis point decrease in gross margin and 110 basis point increase in SG&A expenses. Gross margin contracted primarily from elevated shrink with a partial offset from leveraging occupancy costs.\nSG&A expenses also increased principally from wage investments, minimum wage increases, utility costs and repairs and maintenance costs from improving store conditions. These were partially offset by sales comp leverage.\nMoving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. As a reminder, my comments reflect balance sheet comparisons between Q2 2023 and Q2 2022. Inventory decreased by 1.7%. While inventory was below last year's level, it was elevated due to early receipts of imports. With the rapid recovery across our supply chain, seasonal imports from Asia arrived well ahead of our scheduled third quarter receipts.\nMoving forward, we will continue to manage our inventory and related trade accounts payable to improve free cash flow generation. Capital expenditures were $425.4 million in the second quarter versus $276.2 million last year, reflecting elevated investment levels in new store openings and renovations, supply chain and information systems.\nFor fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures will total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% allocated to maintenance CapEx and the balance towards growth initiatives. Free cash flow improved $40.5 million versus the second quarter of last year. This represents the third consecutive quarterly improvement in free cash flow generation, even as we make significant investments to support the long-term growth of the business.\nFor the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow improved $157 million versus the same period last year, led largely by lower merchandise inventories with a partial offset from lower net income adjusted for noncash items, increased CapEx and the timing of accounts payable. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares for $99.9 million, including applicable excise tax. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $512.7 million compared to $688.9 million a year ago. In July, we established a new commercial paper program to issue unsecured notes with maturities up to 397 days with an aggregate face amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. We expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The notes will rank Perry pursue with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility will serve as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of outstanding notes under this program.\nThis new program provides additional flexibility to manage our working capital needs and at current rates, it provides short-term borrowing at lower rates than our credit facility. There are no notes issued and outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Now let me provide some additional visibility into our sales and EPS expectations for the third quarter and the balance of 2023.\nAt a high level, we are reiterating the center point of the full year outlook we gave last quarter and bringing in the high and low end to better reflect the balance of opportunities and risks we see in the current operating environment. Our outlook takes into consideration the following factors: continued shift in sales mix and unfavorable shrink trends over the balance of the year, our utility and repairs and maintenance costs related to the national heat [indiscernible], higher diesel fuel prices.\nOn the Plus side, we expect improved sales performance and incremental ocean freight savings. That all said, we see nothing systemic or structural in the current environment that would have a lasting negative implications for the multiyear outlook that we shared in June.\nSo against that backdrop, we expect consolidated net sales for the third quarter will be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion. Based on a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise in each of the segments. We estimate third quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.94 to $1.04.\nFor the full fiscal year, which includes a 53rd week this year, we are raising our 2023 sales expectations to a range of $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion, driven by a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales across both segments and the full enterprise. Based on better visibility into the margin headwinds I just detailed, we are narrowing our full year diluted GAAP earnings per share outlook to a range of $5.78 to $6.08, including the $0.12 legal reserve we took in the first quarter.\nWe still expect selling square footage to grow between 3% and 3.5% for the year and new store growth to be back-end weighted. Other considerations and our 2023 outlook include the following. We have not included any assumptions for incremental share repurchases. Depreciation and amortization should be in the range of $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense should be approximately $25 million for the third quarter and approximately $110 million for the full year.\nWe are assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 23% and for the third quarter and approximately 24% for the full year. We expect 220.6 million diluted shares for the third quarter and 221 million diluted shares for the full year. Our outlook reflects continued margin pressures that we expect to persist through the back half of the year. Based on our continued market share gains at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we are in a good position to generate higher levels of rebates and promotional allowances.\nWe also continue to be disciplined in managing our cost structure, even as we make investments necessary to meet our stated long-term growth objective of $10 or more of EPS by 2026. Now I'll turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. We remain very pleased with the progress of our transformation in these early stages and remain confident in the 3-year road map outlined in June. For those of you familiar with my operating philosophy, the immediate focus of any retail turnaround is growing sales. From that perspective, we are succeeding.\nWe are providing a new experience to the next generation of customers across both our segments and seeing strong repeat purchase activity from these new shoppers. Our goal is to provide the consumer with convenience, value, variety and a great shopping experience. Our stores are already conveniently located. 87% of the population of the Continental United States lives within a 5-mile radius of one of our stores.\nAs we grow our footprint, we will be closer and more convenient to an even greater number of customers. I remain confident that our long-term earnings potential can be realized within the time frame we have communicated. Our improving top line performance places us in a position of strength and the combined impact of our merchandising real estate supply chain, IT and people initiatives should put us in an even stronger position relative to the competition. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I will now turn the call over to Randy Guiler. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRandy Guiler\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's First Quarter Fiscal 2023.

Given the large number of those that would like to participate, I ask that you please limit your questions to one.\nI will now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.\nAs many of you are aware, Dollar Tree will be hosting its investor conference in 4 weeks on June 21 in [ Northfolk ], Virginia, near our corporate headquarters. The conference will be webcast, and I hope to see many of you at this important event. Our investor conference has been overdue, and we understand the level of anticipation for many investors. I hope next month's gathering will provide each of you a better understanding of the transformation taking shape and the speed with which we are making these changes to increase both our productivity and profitability at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\nWe have been hard at work building the team we need to drive the transformation of this business. The more we dig in, the more historically clear the opportunity becomes, and we are on our way to most fully realize upon it. Our stores are of comparable size to those of our closest peers but they generate far less revenue per store. We understand why, and we know how to close the gap. There are no structural impediments to our progressing towards this goal. As we do, we will drive growth and gain market share. With the operating leverage embedded in the retail model, accelerating growth in revenue per store will translate into higher margins, and higher margins will increase our return on capital and fueling accelerated store growth. We've gone down this road before, and we know the way. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve both of our segments, and we are pursuing that with vigor.\nWhile our enterprise-wide transformation is still in the early stages, we are already seeing results. Our early initiatives have begun to deliver growth and market share gains. We are driving this transformation in the most dynamic retail environment I have seen in my career. While this volatility is real and will generate bumps along the way, it will not affect where this great adventure ends.\nIn addition to the historic levels of inflation and labor market challenges retailers have seen in just the past quarter, elevated levels of shrink and even further pressure on the consumers' willingness to spend on discretionary goods, shrink and the mix shift from discretionary goods have pressured margins throughout retail. We are no exception. Ultimately, shrink will either be resolved through defensive merchandising, store closures and/or through government action at the local level. Regarding the near-term unfavorable impact of consumables mix, we believe consumer shopping behavior will normalize over time and the margin profile will rebound. We are acutely attuned to each of these bumps. In the end, none will materially affect our delivering on the promise of this transformation unless we allow them to distract us from what we know we have to do, and we will not allow that to happen.\nWe bench our top line sales performance primarily on 3 specific metrics. Sales per square foot growth, growth in transaction count and unit sales to volume growth. Based on these 3 metrics, I am pleased with our quarter 1 performance and the direction we are headed. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Most significantly, we continue to gain market share, and our traffic and unit volume growth are driving strong top line momentum. The market share gains are a clear validation of the actions that we have taken on pricing and wages and the ongoing improvements we have made in our merchandise assortment, service level and store standards.\nNow, despite our commercial success and building momentum, we are experiencing near-term margin pressures from the macro factors impacting sales mix and elevated shrink. But the most important message that I want to convey today is that we remain completely focused on delivering on our full potential and are executing on our transformation investments at full speed.\nI will now review the highlights for quarter 1. Following my remarks, Jeff will provide a detailed overview of our financial performance and our updated 2023 outlook.\nFor the quarter, we delivered $7.32 billion in sales, an increase of 6.1%, with enterprise comp growth of 4.8% and operating income of $419.7 million, leading to EPS of $1.35 and adjusted EPS of $1.47, when adjusting for a $30 million accrual related to pending legal matters regarding our West Memphis distribution center. Our merchandising and execution remains strong, with comp increases of 3.4% at Dollar Tree and 6.6% at Family Dollar. The underlying sales strength was concentrated in consumables and driven by meaningful transaction growth across both segments.\nResults were even more impressive in the context of Dollar Tree's 11.2% comp increase from a year ago. After fully cycling the $1.25 price point in February, customer traffic remained very favorable at Dollar Tree as comparable traffic count increased by 5.5%. Notably, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in comps at Family Dollar, with comp traffic up 4.3%. For nearly all of 2022 comp traffic counts trends in both segments were negative, so quarter 1 was an important inflection point for the company, with traffic increasing both sequentially and year-over-year.\nThe turnaround at Family Dollar is gaining meaningful traction. In addition to the improving traffic, Family Dollar's comp was driven by a 2.2% increase in average ticket. At Family Dollar, we increased our private brand penetration by approximately 80 basis points. Moving forward, we expect to continue growing private brands penetration as we further improve merchandise, presentation, packaging and quality control standards. For example, we recently opened a new test kitchen here in Chesapeake and are excited about our growing pipeline of private brand products across consumables, health and beauty and other high-growth categories. We are also encouraged by the margin opportunities associated with expanding our private brands business.\nLast year, we took pricing actions at Family Dollar to bring us more in line with our most direct competition. These price investments strengthen our value offering at Family Dollar and followed our transition to the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree. Along with investments in wages and store standards, the steps we have taken on pricing across both segments are critical to improving our long-term financial and operating performance. As I mentioned earlier, the consumer continues to be under pressure. There are simply fewer dollars available to them, and those dollars are not going as far as they did a year or 2 ago. We are past the multiple rounds of government stimulus, [ snap ] dollars have been reduced and tax refunds are running lower.\nThese impacts, combined with persistent inflation, have more families prioritizing needs over wants. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are part of the solution for shoppers buying for need and close to need as they look to stretch their paychecks. Our stores are nearby, easy to shop, and provide tremendous value. While these factors are contributing to the mix shift and pressuring our gross margins, they are also driving more shoppers into our stores with increased frequency. We will continue to respond to the needs of the consumer across both consumables and discretionary categories by offering tremendous value and a great selection. While this mix shift towards consumables is clearly a margin headwind, it is worth noting that the promotional environment remains rational and is not driving any additional margin pressure.\nAt Dollar Tree, we made great strides with our multi-price strategy, and we remain on track to add $3 and $5-plus items to another 1,800 stores this year. In quarter 1, we added Dollar Tree Plus assortments to more than 400 stores, and anticipate accelerating the pace of this rollout over the balance of the year. Additionally, we have aggressively expanded our product assortment at Dollar Tree stores with $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated products, adding 3,500 stores last year alone on this initiative.\nDuring the first quarter, we added multi-price frozen and refrigerated doors and more than 400 Dollar Tree stores. Both our Dollar Trees and our multi-price frozen assortments drive incremental sales, with average ticket more than doubling its stores that we have added this expanded offering. Consumers are clearly responding, and the sales driving initiatives are already having a measurable impact on our results.\nFamily Dollar, we are on track to add 16,000 new cooler doors in 2023. This is helping drive Family Dollar to its highest market share in close to 4 years as measured by quarter 1 dollar volume. On a unit volume basis, Family Dollar's quarter 1 share of industry growth was the highest in more than 3 years. We continue to improve the in-store experience at Family Dollar and completed more than 250 store renovations in the quarter.\nOn last quarter's call, I shared the strategic rationale for our increased SG&A spending in 2023. These investments should be pursued as rapidly as our management bandwidth will allow. The sooner each is implemented, the sooner we will enjoy the benefits and the greater impact of our other investments. All of this is ultimately connected and interdependent. Many of our investments will be ongoing, including those on our associates and store conditions, and again, the results are starting to come in. We have already seen meaningful improvements in sales momentum and reduced associate turnover.\nIn closing, we have a plan. I'm confident this plan will drive meaningful top line growth, increase productivity and improve profitability. We are vigorously executing on it. We will not allow bumps in the road to distract us or slow us down, and it's clear it's starting to work. Our investments in price, our stores, our merchandise and our associates have already begun delivering results.\nWe will get to where we're going, but how we get there matters as well. I firmly believe that investments in our people and the communities we serve are the cornerstones of a successful retailer. We have taken a comprehensive approach to improve wages and benefits for our people and to increase associate engagement to make Dollar Tree and Family Dollar great places to work and grow. It is vital for the continued success of our organization to have a strong culture. While there is work to be done, we are pleased that our culture efforts are taking root and building the foundation for a thriving future. Finally, I am so very proud of the tremendous efforts of our 200,000-plus associates, each of whom has contributed to the great progress we are making and each of whom deserves our collective thanks.\nWhile Jeff will cover our outlook in more detail, I want to emphasize that we remain confident in the outlook for our business and our continued sales momentum. Our go-to-market strategies at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are working and clearly resonating with consumers. I look forward to sharing more detail on our long-term vision and our multiyear outlook next month at our investor conference.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nTreasurer & Senior Vice President, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Rick mentioned, our top line performance was strong in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. It was driven by meaningful growth in customer traffic, continued market share gains and an increase in underlying unit growth. Total sales increased 6.1% to $7.3 billion based on comp store sales growth of 4.8%. Traffic increased 5% on a consolidated basis, and average ticket was down slightly. Across the enterprise, our sales mix of consumables increased approximately 200 basis [ points ] as customer purchase behavior responded to deteriorating macro conditions.\nOur service levels were particularly strong in Q1. In-stock positions improved by 400 basis points in the Dollar Tree segment and by 200 basis points at Family Dollar. Our DC service levels also improved for both segments by nearly 1,600 basis points at Dollar Tree and approximately 500 basis points at Family Dollar.\nOperating income decreased by 43% to $419.1 million. Adjusted operating income decreased by 39% to $449.7 million. Recall that in Q1, we cycled the first full quarter of the $1.25 price point transition at Dollar Tree, which resulted in unfavorable margin comparisons given the outsized benefit we saw in Q1 last year. The variance between operating income and adjusted operating income came from a $30 million accrual related to previously-disclosed legal proceedings associated with our Family Dollar distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas.\nGross profit decreased by 4.7% to $2.23 billion as gross margin [ contracted ] by 340 basis points. The biggest driver of the gross margin decline was merchandise cost. In Q1 last year, we benefited from the rollout of the $1.25 price point at Dollar Tree. In the current period, our sales mix shifted approximately 200 basis points towards lower-margin consumable merchandise. The impact of higher cost of goods and unfavorable sales mix were partially offset by lower freight costs and markdowns as we cycled the impact of our West Memphis DC closure last year.\nAs Rick noted, elevated levels of shrink represent a persistent challenge. In Q1, shrink negatively impacted gross margin by 60 basis points and EPS by an incremental $0.14 per share compared to last year.\nOn a business segment basis, Dollar Tree gross margin declined by approximately 530 basis points, primarily from lower merchandise margin based on the higher consumable mix and cycling the initial transition to the $1.25 price point, elevated shrink expense and increased distribution costs. We benefited modestly from lower spot rates for ocean freight relative to last year. But to date, this is only impacting a small portion of our shipments, with a larger impact of savings from freight rate declines to come in the second half and into the years ahead.\nFamily Dollar's gross margin decreased by approximately 100 basis points, with largely the same factors contributing to the decline as Dollar Tree. Specifically, gross margin was negatively impacted by mix, product cost increases, higher shrink and higher distribution costs, partially offset by lower markdowns and lower freight expenses.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points to 24.8%. The biggest driver was wage investments for store and distribution center associates. We also experienced higher store facility costs as we continue to focus on improving store conditions as well as higher professional and marketing expenses.\nCorporate, support and other expenses were 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 10 basis points from last year. Net income was $299 million and EPS was $1.35 in comparison to $2.37 a year ago. Adjusted net income was $325.1 million and adjusted EPS was $1.47. The $0.12 adjustment was related to the West Memphis [ legal agreement ]. Our effective tax rate was 24.1% versus 23.1% last year, reflecting lower stock-based compensation deductions and higher nondeductible expenses, partially offset by higher work opportunity tax [ credits ]. Adjusted for the impact of the West Memphis accrual, the Q1 implied tax rate for this year was 23.3% or 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow, my comments will reflect balance sheet comparisons at the end of Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Inventory increased 6.5% primarily from an increase in merchandise costs, DC unit volume growth, the continued rollout of our Dollar Tree multi-price inventory and new store growth. The quality of our inventory remains high and manageable. Q1 capital expenditures were $350.4 million versus $253.4 million. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion, with approximately 40% dedicated to business continuity and the balance directed towards growth, optimization and productivity improvement. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $151.1 million, of which $7.7 million did not settle until after quarter end. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $872.8 million compared to $1.2 billion. Our cash position increased $230 million in Q1 from the end of fiscal 2022 led by working capital improvements, partially offset by capital expenditures and share repurchases. Free cash flow improved to $402 million from $285 million last year.\nMoving to our sales and EPS outlook. The company expects consolidated net sales for the second quarter will range from $7 billion to $7.2 billion, based on a mid-single-digit increase in comp store sales for the enterprise and for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments. Diluted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. As a reminder, the bulk of our ocean freight savings for the year will fall in the second half, as previously mentioned.\nWith respect to full year fiscal 2023 guidance, recall that fiscal 2023 has a 53rd week. Consolidated sales for the full fiscal year are now expected to range from $30 billion to $30.5 billion. The company expects to deliver a low to mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low to mid-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by 3% to 3.5% for the year, with new store growth back-end weighted.\nWhile we modestly raised the midpoint of our top line guidance, we are incrementally more cautious on our margin outlook given the growing industry-wide challenges of accelerating shrink, the unfavorable shift in sales mix and their impact on our near-term profitability. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, the impact of these 2 factors on our financial results has intensified. We expect that over time, our mix of discretionary will normalize and that we will also improve our performance on shrink through defensive merchandising efforts, real estate optimization and perhaps higher prices to compensate for areas of systematically higher shrink. We expect the combined and continuing full year earnings impact of unfavorable consumables mix and higher shrink is expected to be approximately $0.55 per share in 2023.\nOur modeling considerations for 2023 outlook include the following. We expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million in Q2 and $110 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.1% to 24.3% for the second quarter and 23.9% to 24.1% for fiscal 2023.\nWhile our share repurchases are not included in our outlook, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of April 29. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 221.4 million shares for Q2 and 221.6 million shares for the full year. For the balance of 2023, we will work diligently to offset potential margin pressures that could come from elevated levels of discretionary inventory. We are taking actions to mitigate the potential impact of these cost pressures such as further optimizing our promotional spending and vendor allowances, identifying opportunities to further reduce inbound freight costs and managing repairs and maintenance costs. We continue to see full year earnings benefit of $1 per share from lower ocean freight costs this year, which could be significantly weighted towards the back half of the year, and an additional $1 per share benefit in 2024 and beyond.\nAs a result of the factors I just outlined, we are revising our diluted GAAP EPS outlook for fiscal 2023 to a range of $5.73 to $6.13, which includes the expected contribution from the 53rd week and the $0.12 legal reserve taken in Q1.\nI will now turn the call back over to Rick for closing remarks.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nChairman, Lowe's Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff.\nWe are continuing to execute at a high level and acting with urgency around our business transformation, and I am pleased with our solid start to 2023. We are looking forward to our investor conference next month, where we expect to provide our investors and analysts with a multiyear outlook for the business, including a substantive and comprehensive overview of the key elements of our business. Our team has identified multiple levers to unlock value, and we have strong underlying business [indiscernible] that positions us favorably in the current retail and economic environment. We see a path to greater earnings power over the next 3 years and look forward to sharing our plans in more detail next month.\nI also want to take this opportunity to welcome our new supply chain officer, [ Mike Kindy ]. I have worked with Mike in previous organizations, and he is a proven subject matter expert and thought leader in supply chain and logistics. I am very confident that Mike will demonstrate continued success at Dollar Tree based on his past record.\nI also want to thank [ John Flanagan ] for his contributions, which helped us get to where we are today. While John communicated to us at the outset is desired to serve only for a short period, over the past year, john has led our supply chain strategy and has overseen the early stages of the process to optimize our distribution network, and he's had a tremendous impact.\nWe are moving at a fast pace in our journey to fundamentally reposition our combined retailing operations for sustainable long-term growth. Our efforts are already paying off in the form of significant market share gains at both segments. Both formats have a clear runway for accelerated growth in productivity and profitability. Our leaders have complete ownership over the factors that will shape our outlook for the next 3 to 5 years. We have a winning team of more than 200,000 associates who are highly motivated and eager to succeed. I look forward to sharing more next month at our conference.\nAnd one last note. Before we go to Q&A, I want to share some IR news with you. Several months ago, Randy Guiler communicated with us his retirement plans. This advanced notification provided us with ample opportunity to seek Randy's replacement. I want to thank Randy for his 9 years of dedicated service leading the IR function at Dollar Tree. I am pleased to share that [ Bob LaFleur ] joined Dollar Tree on Monday of this week as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Randy will be with us at our upcoming investor conference and is continuing in his current role with the company through the month of June to help facilitate a smooth transition. Please join me in congratulating Randy on his impending retirement, and Bob on his new role at Dollar Tree.\nOperator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions.",

This meeting is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Randy Guiler. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRandy Guiler\n\nVP of IR, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Dollar Tree's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 results. With me on today's call are Chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling; and CFO, Jeff Davis.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please see the risk factors, business and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our 10-K filed March 15, 2022, our 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter. Today's press release and 8-K and other filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law. Following our prepared remarks, Rick and Jeff will take your questions. Given the large number of those that would like to participate, I ask that you limit your questions to one. I will now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. I apologize that I'm a little horse. I'm coming off of COVID and the good news is I'm fine. I will review the highlights for quarter 4 fiscal 2022 and will provide an update on current priorities. Then Jeff will detail our financial performance and expectations for 2023.\nFor the quarter, we delivered $7.72 billion in sales, an increase of 9%, with enterprise comp growth of 7.4%, operating income of $618.1 million, leading to a quarter 4 EPS of $2.04. Our sales performance for the fourth quarter was a continuation of momentum from quarter 3. Same-store sales growth of 8.7% at Dollar Tree and 5.8% at Family Dollar represented comp accelerations on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. This improved performance and market share gain is not simply happening by itself. It's the result of lots of hard work and good work by our store and merchant teams as well as the early fruits of our price, labor and store investments. And I truly believe we are just getting started.\nI have been in retailing for half a century. And I've been fortunate to play a leadership role in multiple transformations. I am incredibly excited by and energized to be part of the path ahead for Dollar Tree. We have an exceptional team assembled, and I cannot overstate the amount of positive transformational change occurring in this business. We are committed to enhancing store productivity as we focus on developing our people, tools and technology to fuel accelerated growth. And that we do this while simplifying operations, improving the supply chain and innovating our merchandising strategies to better support our associates and to better serve our shoppers.\nGiven the team's relevant prior experiences, we know exactly what to do to drive improved productivity and profitability. We are moving as quickly as possible to capture the full potential of this business, and I am confident we will succeed. We have tremendous opportunity to improve the Dollar Tree banner. At Family Dollar, it's clear that we are at least a decade behind, and this is reflected in our prior performance levels and financial results. As we narrow the gap operationally, it will be realized in material improvements to our financial performance. As we get settled in, we are finding more and more opportunities to meaningfully improve both banners.\nCompared to just a few short months ago, the list of improvement opportunities has grown. Our guiding objective is to maximize returns to our shareholders. Doing so calls for implementing these initiatives with responsible urgency. There is no point in dialing. It has, over the months, become increasingly clear that our team's great experience gives us the opportunity to complete in just 3 to 5 years, most of what has taken far longer in other situations.\nOur merchants, stores and other teams are driving lots of initiatives, many of them with minimal investment. I will highlight some of these later. While these are already gaining traction, they will have the greatest impact, if supported by additional complementary investments. The stronger our associate team, the better the store conditions the more competitive our pricing, the more we will get out of them. There is a synergy across these initiatives and the complementary investments we are making with each enhancing the others. For this reason, we are accelerating and pulling forward our schedule of major high-returning investments. The cost of these investments is reflected in our 2023 outlook, as an incremental $430 million increase in SG&A, and the outlook assumes only a minimal return from these investments. The company is confident that these investments once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond.\nWhile we are confident these operating expense investments will yield strong returns, we are also aware of the dynamic nature of the earliest stages of a turnaround. The many simultaneous moving pieces, the interdependence of many of these pieces and in current unusual dynamics in the economy. These considerations make forecasting the quarterly cadence of the benefits from these investments, particularly challenging. For this reason, for this first year of our transformation, we will consider these benefits only as they, in fact, materialize.\nThis year's investments, which include the full year impact of investments made during fiscal 2022 are in several key areas in the following order of magnitude, labor and wages, including hourly wage rates and investments in field personnel, stores, through repairs and maintenance and improving store conditions, corporate, including technology and other initiatives. Under this new leadership team, we are increasing average hourly wages and estimated $2 for the 2-year period of 2022 and 2023. We feel that looking on a market-by-market basis and benchmarking to comparable retail wages, this investment will put us in a more competitive position. We also made additional investments in store hours and coverage, investments in our field labor and managers and other areas to help us execute much better. We expect these labor and wage investments will drive improved execution in our stores, higher sales, lower turnover, attraction of and retention of talent, reduce shrink and greater productivity and efficiency.\nOur associates and field personnel are critical to our transformation journey and we are excited about the investments in our talent. We are looking to invigorate the culture of this business, give our local operators and associates, the tools they need to execute and importantly provide them the opportunities they deserve to grow within our company.\nOn store standards, we call last quarter, I spoke about an intense focus on store standards, our commitments to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. When we do this, our shoppers respond with a bigger basket and more importantly, with repeat visits. Our new COO, Mike Creedon, joined the team in October. Mike possesses a relentless focus on the 3 pillars of successful store operations, the work, the worker and the workplace. The work we must run efficient and productive stores. As a high transaction volume business, it's critical we have processes in place to get product onto our shelves quickly. I'm certain that we can't sell a product if it's in the back room. Approving efficiencies and workflows positively impacts our associate experience.\nThe worker, as an organization must be a cornerstone that we support and enable our associates to be successful. This commitment will enhance our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain associates and contribute to their retail career development. We believe this focus, combined with our wage investments are contributing to the reduction in turnover that we are starting to see. The workplace and as we have indicated in the past, we must improve our store and DC conditions, and we are in the process of doing so. Frankly, stores and DCs were not being maintained up to our new leadership standards. We are actively transitioning from what we consider to be reactive to proactive maintenance approach.\nIn addition to the work, the worker and the workplace, Mike's team are in the process of identifying certified GOLD stores for each region. GOLD stands for a Grand Opening Look Daily. These stores will serve as a clear, concise example for our district and store leadership teams across all regions so they have a distinct vision and understanding of what our most successful and well-run stores look like.\nOn the question of our corporate investments, I will address these later in the call. Our merchandising teams led by Rick McNeely and [Lara Gada] are working hard. The Dollar Tree merchant team successfully managed through the transition to the $1.25 primary price point. As we cycle the majority of these stores throughout the fourth quarter, we saw a 410 basis point sequential improvement in traffic compared to quarter 3.\nNow that we have anniversaried the remainder of our stores in February, traffic is positive, and we are confident it will be a contributor to positive comps at Dollar Tree throughout the year. In 2022, we added $3 and $5 plus merchandise into more than 1,800 Dollar Tree stores. We plan to add this multiple price point product in another 1,800 or more stores in 2023. And when we begin flowing this multiple price product through 3 additional distribution centers, bringing our total to 7.\nSeparately, we have been aggressively expanding our $3, $4, $5 frozen and refrigerated product across the Dollar Tree store base going from 0 to 3,500 stores in 2022.\nThis consists of 3 cooler doors, 1 at each price point with an attractive selection of proteins, pizza, ice cream and more, which the customers are responding positively to. What we are seeing with Dollar Tree plus and multiple price frozen is that when the customer purchased at least one of these items, the basket size is more than double the basket with no multi-priced items. We are experiencing a more consistent and predictable slide chain. Stores were set well in advance for Valentine's Day, and we had terrific sell-through. The stores are now well prepared for the Easter season. And with $1.25 transition now behind us, we believe it's time for Dollar Tree merchants to get more creative than ever before. They have [carved launch] to raise the bar on delighting customers and driving sales and all options are up for discussion. We believe doing what is easy has no reward.\nIn addition to the opportunities at the Dollar Tree banner, we have a tremendous long-term opportunity to improve the operating performance at Family Dollar. We have a number of sales and margin-driving initiatives that are already underway, albeit in the early stages. But as you have seen, these have contributed to the 4.1% comp in quarter 3, followed by a 5.8% in quarter 4. Among our actions are the following: we have begun raising the shelf height to a 70-inch profile throughout the stores to enable us to broaden the product offering for our shoppers. This profit-enhancing initiative allows us to grow our SKU base by 1,000 items, including OTC and [HBA], without increasing our store-related costs.\nWe are continuing to expand the number of cooler doors with plans to add 16,000 doors in 2023 to accommodate more frozen and refrigerated items. Our goal is to have 30 doors per store. Our shoppers rely on Family Dollar in their communities to provide these consumable base products to feed their families. We are replacing our control brands with private brands, and we will be introducing hundreds of national brand equivalent products in the back half of this year. These will include new labels and redefined labels, many of which are being developed in our new test kitchen here in Chesapeake, Virginia.\nTo better meet both store and shopper needs, we are improving our ability to ship in [ECS], which improves inventory flow and profitability on slower moving, higher-margin items including the over-the-counter and health and beauty products. This enables us to be more nimble and provides greater flexibility. Additionally, we are working on improving Family Dollar productivity by enhancing end-cap displays, eliminating flex space and refining store adjacencies to better optimize the box. These are just a few examples that Larry's teams are focused on that we believe will contribute to Family Dollars improved sales trajectory in the sales ahead.\nWe continue to be pleased with our positioning from a price perspective. We are at parity with key competitors and have widened the gap to grocery and drug. Shoppers have responded to the sharp pricing actions we took in late quarter 2 and third-party data suggest that Family Dollar is seeing an increasing amount of new customers in our stores.\nI will now turn the mic over to Jeff Davis, while Jeff has just been in his CFO seat at Dollar Tree since October, he is peddling fast and making great progress in a number of key strategic initiatives including leading the development of our long-term financial plan. Jeff will now provide more color on quarter 4 and what's ahead of us.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nCFO, Qurate Retail Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Unless otherwise stated, all fourth quarter comparisons are against the same period a year ago. In addition to my comments today, a supplemental slide deck that outlines several of our key operating metrics is available on our Investor Relations website.\nOperating income increased 6.8% to $618.1 million or 8% of total revenue a 20 basis point decline in operating margin. This was compared to a 70 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, which was more than offset by SG&A. Gross profit increased 11.6% to $2.39 billion. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 110 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and sales leverage, partially offset by product mix, product cost inflation and higher costs for markdowns, shrink and distribution.\nFamily Dollar's gross margin increased 20 basis points. This quarter represented Family Dollar's first improvement in gross margin in the last 7 quarters. The improvement was driven by higher initial mark-on, lower freight cost and leverage on occupancy, partially offset by mix, markdowns, shrink and higher distribution costs.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 80 basis points to 22.9%. The increase is due to a $23.9 million noncash store impairment charge along with elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store and DC standards. Investments in store and distribution center hourly wages, and inflationary costs across several expense categories. Corporate support and other expenses were consistent at 1.4% of revenue. Net income was $452.2 million, and EPS was $2.04 in comparison to $2.01 a year ago.\nMoving to the balance sheet. My comments will reflect balanced comparisons at the end of Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $643 million compared to $985 million. Inventory increased 24.8%, primarily from unit growth associated with early receipts of spring 2023 merchandise, Family Dollar combo expansion and new store unit growth and cost growth from product inflation, including freight, the expansion of the $1.25 and multi-price plus inventory. Units per store are at a similar level to pre-pandemic period. Our inventory is fresh, and we have limited dated inventory well within manageable levels.\nCapital expenditures were $328 million, in the fourth quarter versus $271.6 million. For fiscal 2023, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $2 billion. Of this $2 billion, we would characterize 39% is dedicated to business continuity with the remaining 61% for what we consider to be growth optimization and productivity improvement. The business continuity includes projects to run and operate our stores and DCs as well as enhanced safety and compliance programs. More specifically, this would include freezers and coolers, HVAC replacements and facility improvements for stores. DC conveyor projects and building improvements for our distribution facilities, enhance permanent cooling for our DCs and store safety and asset protection related projects.\nOur growth optimization and productivity improvement projects will include approximately 650 new stores, an estimated 1,000 store renovations, numerous distribution center projects and technology projects to enhance our efficiencies and support our growth.\nOur 2023 sales and EPS expectations incorporate a number of factors. First, this is a 53-week year. We expect this will benefit the fourth quarter by approximately $500 million in sales and $0.29 in diluted EPS. Second, we are cycling the outsized margin benefit for Dollar Tree's initial transition to the $1.25 price point where last year, it produced a 39% margin rate in the first half of 2022 as we evolved our assortments to the new price point. Also for both segments, we expect to see continued cost pressure from inflation and margin pressure from merchandise mix as consumables are expected to outpace discretionary sales. Third, our outlook includes a benefit of approximately $1 per share from reduced freight expenses with nearly all of that benefit realized in the second half. Approximately half of our fiscal 2023 import container volume will remain at existing long-term contracts or charters at elevated rates.\nWe anticipate meaningfully lower rates for renegotiated contracts and spot volumes, which we expect to impact the remaining half of our container volume for the year. These factors limit the impact of lower freight rates on operating profits within the year. The Dollar Tree segment will realize approximately 80% of these freight savings, which will support a gross margin rate in the range of 36% to 37% in fiscal 2023. If current market conditions persist, we expect an additional freight cost relief of approximately $1 in fiscal 2024 and 2025 with the majority realized in fiscal 2024.\nFour, our outlook includes approximately $430 million or $1.45 per share in operating expenses across labor and wages, store repairs and maintenance and corporate as we accelerate our investments to transform this company. These investments are roughly split evenly between the 2 banners and include investments in corporate. Given the amount of transformational activity, initiative interdependencies and the volatility of economic environment, it is difficult to precisely estimate the timing and related magnitude of investment returns.\nOur 2023 outlook assumes only a minimal benefit from these investments. Company is confident that these investments, once implemented, will yield attractive returns in 2024 and beyond. There is strong evidence in the back half of 2022 that management's actions and investments are already yielding results at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as evidenced by our recent trends. While our outlook assumes minimal profit contribution from Family Dollar this year, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to improve Family Dollar sales productivity and margins and we are confident this opportunity will realize and produce meaningful profits in the years ahead.\nFinally, we will continue to focus on people, store conditions, tools and technology to drive growth and long-term operating performance improvements. We expect SG&A expense dollars, which includes general inflation, new store expenses and accelerated investments as well as the 53rd week to grow in the low teens. Based on the confluence of these factors, we anticipate year-over-year gross and operating margins will decline in the first half of 2023, followed by growth in the second half. We estimate 2023 EPS will be comprised of approximately 40% in the first half and approximately 60% in the second half which includes 1 extra week in Q4.\nConsolidated net sales for the full year fiscal 2023 are expected to range from $29.9 billion to $30.5 billion. We expect a low to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase for the year, comprised of a low single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a mid-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow from 3% to 3.5%.\nOur new store openings this year will be more back end weighted compared to 2022. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $6.30 and $6.80. For Q1, we forecast consolidated net sales will range from $2.7 billion to $7.4 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for Q1 are estimated to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.56. While share repurchases are not included in the outlook, we had $1.85 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of January 28.\nOther modeling considerations for the 2023 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $845 million to $850 million. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million in Q1 and $97 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.25% to 24.5% for the first quarter and for the fiscal 2023 period. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.4 million shares for Q1 and 222.6 million shares for the full year.\nI'll now turn the call back to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. As an organization, we are moving fast. Our operating initiatives are in flight and are gaining steam and the current economic climate is driving more higher income consumers into value retail. We believe we are in the right spot to deliver quality, value and convenience that shoppers need today. The momentum is continuing as both segments are off to a nice start early in quarter 1.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I want to briefly discuss 2 additional contributors to our future success. Information technology and supply chain. In order to unlock the value creation opportunity ahead of us, we must have the right tools and technology in place to support our accelerated growth. [Bobby Aflatooni's] Technology Group has a clear vision and they are prioritizing projects that will have the greatest impact on our enhanced performance. Some of the increased speed fueling these projects, our capital expenditures and some are operating expenses. All of the projected spend for this year is captured and included in our outlook.\nAnd John Flanagan's supply chain team is doing a great deal of work to enhance efficiency and ensure the stores have the merchandise they need and can upstock it easily. We have identified an approach for eliminating the inefficiency of our current manual case-by-case handling process. This should enable us to more efficiently and reliably get products from our DCs onto our trucks and then into our stores. John has committed to having at least 1 DC up and running on the new process by the end of the year, which much more to come in 2024 and beyond. This will be a big step forward for our organization and especially for our store associates.\nAlso, I would like to pat our DC teams on the back. In the past year, all 25 of our DCs have been good distribution practices certified by an independent third-party auditor, and we are already in the process to begin recertifying for 2023. The company is very proud of this achievement and believe it demonstrates our company's commitment to our associates to run good clean buildings. 2022 represented a year of substantial change for the Dollar Tree organization. Of the 16 officers listed on Dollar Tree's website, only 2 were with our company 15 months ago. That is clearly a great deal of change in a very short period of time.\nI would like to share my sincere gratitude to our 207,000 associates that have not only embraced change but have welcomed our new leaders and me to the organization. One day, we will be able to reflect on 2022 as the inflection point that got our company back on track. To capture the remarkable long-term value creation journey ahead of us. The team knows that I'm all in, in my commitment to support our store and field associates as they develop and grow in their retail careers by running full, clean and friendly stores to serve our shoppers each and every day. The long-term opportunity ahead of us is bigger than I imagined before I joined the Dollar Tree team.\nI want to be very clear. This transformation is not about saving dollars to deliver success. It's about spending dollars in the right places to unlock the future value of the business. This transformation is a process, which includes stabilizing the organization as we run and operate our business and make investments to modernize and transform the company to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nAs Jeff outlined, we pulled forward into 2023, certain investments that could otherwise have been extended for several years. And consequently, we expect fiscal 2023 to be a step back in earnings from the prior year. We're excited about this acceleration of initiatives and investments as it means higher and earlier returns in the years ahead. This is an important year to put us on a path for an acceleration in growth and earnings as we move forward.\nWe believe that this approach will maximize returns for our shareholders. Our leaders are eager to share more details on our vision and the path to get there, and we will do so in a more structured format in our Investor Day here in Southeast Virginia, currently being planned for June. We intend for this to be the first of several events over the years ahead as we outline our transformation and its progress along the way.\nBefore I turn it over to questions, I would like to take a moment on behalf of the employees, Board, shareholders to extend our thanks to Mike Witynski for his years of service and contributions. Mike, we're all grateful to you and wish you the best. Operator, Jeff and I are now ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Randy Guiler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRandy Guiler\n\nVP of IR, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's Third Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Jeff Davis.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements.\nFor information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the Risk Factors, Business and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual reports on Form 10-K filed March 15, 2022, our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, our most recent press release and Form 8-K and other filings we make from time to time with the SEC. We caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, Mike and Jeff will take your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nExecutive Chairman, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy. And good morning, everyone. In my short time here, I have been incredibly impressed with the team's overall enthusiasm and willingness to accept and embrace much needed change. As I stated last quarter, we are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.\nThe company is moving at a rapid pace. We have done a remarkable job of rebuilding our executive team and with retail thought leaders that are subject matter experts and eager to be part of this transformational journey that we have embarked on. In a short period of time, all of our C-suite positions have been filled as well as new leadership roles dedicated to a number of key areas, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communication. Last quarter, we shared news of the material price investments made at Family Dollar. These actions got on price parity with key competitors and widen our spread to grocery and drug stores. Customers are recognizing this commitment to value, which contributed to a 4% comp sales increase and the segment's first quarterly traffic increase in 3 years.\nThe teams are focused on improving store standards. They are committed to clean them up, straighten them up and fill them up. Improving sales productivity is a vital component of the Family Dollar turnaround, and we are extremely focused on driving sales per square foot, unit sales growth and transaction count growth. We are a company with more than 16,200 stores. But the way I prefer to look at this is that we are really 2 growth companies with 8,100-plus stores each. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are unique businesses with 2 different go-to-market strategies. Having 2 distinct large segments provides us flexibility like none other in value retail and both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have extraordinary opportunity for growth and improvement over time.\nWe are prioritizing our areas of growth, and we are moving with urgency. The new management team is in-house. We've taken aggressive action on price. The advertising and marketing cadence has been enhanced. We are in the midst of a cultural transformation throughout the organization, designed to enhance our associate and customer experience. Store standards are improving. Years of sales productivity opportunities are ahead of us and work on supply chain and technology initiatives will enhance us to achieve our ultimate goals. I know many are eager to learn more about all of our plans, including the timing, the magnitude and the expected returns. These details will be shared at our spring Investor Day in a more structured format as our new leadership team has assembled more time together.\nWe are entirely committed on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long-term. On behalf of our directors, I want to thank each of our associates for their commitment, dedication and effort, especially for their willingness to embrace much needed change. This is a journey that I am thrilled to be part of.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in recent months, we have announced a number of executives have joined Dollar Tree. I am excited about the caliber and quality of the leadership team we now have in place. This team will lead our company through the next evolution of growth. We are committed to transforming our culture, meeting our shoppers and associates' needs, improving store productivity and efficiencies and delivering improved long-term operating results.\nI am pleased with the team's efforts to deliver solid results for the quarter. Our third quarter sales performance reflects the timely execution of merchandising initiatives to drive our consumables business in this uncertain and inflationary environment. Same-store sales for both segments improved from the prior quarter and delivered sequential monthly improvement throughout the quarter. Shoppers are responding to our new value proposition at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree as we focus on driving both traffic and store productivity.\nWith the exception of Q1 and Q2 of 2020 at the initial onset of the pandemic, our 6.5% enterprise comp represents our best quarter since the Family Dollar acquisition. By segment, the comp was comprised of an 8.6% increase for Dollar Tree and a 4.1% increase for Family Dollar. In recent quarters, we refined our strategies at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to focus on the traffic-driving consumables side of the business. Our transition to the $1.25 price point has enabled our merchants to greatly enhance value for our shoppers. For the second consecutive quarter, our consumables comp outpaced the discretionary comp at Dollar Tree. The team delivered a 9.3% comp on consumables with key contributors being in food and beverage, snack and cookies and candy.\nFamily Dollar consumables increased 4.7% on a comp basis. Despite the ticket headwinds related to our price actions in Q2, shoppers are clearly recognizing the greater value and are responding to our enhanced advertising initiatives. Importantly, at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we saw an acceleration in comp performance throughout the quarter, with October being our strongest month.\nWe have a number of key sales-driving initiatives to drive productivity. For Dollar Tree stores, we are continuing to exceed the customer's expectation for value, our merchants do a tremendous job of effectively managing the ever-changing assortment that wows our shoppers, expanding our $3 and $5 offering into more stores. We ended the quarter with our plus assortment in nearly 30% of our Dollar Tree stores, and we'll continue to aggressively expand this initiative in the years ahead. We are currently refining our $3 and $5 assortment as our team operates in an environment of continuous improvement based on learnings. We are developing our frozen assortment to meet our shoppers' family needs as they are looking to save money by dining at home. We are aggressively expanding our offerings of protein, pizza, breakfast items and family sizes at price points that meet their budgets.\nWe will continue to focus on winning the season. Dollar Tree is a destination for shoppers looking to celebrate holidays, events and seasons. Our offering will be better than last year but not as good as next year as we continue to improve our assortments. Family Dollar, from a pricing perspective, is in the best position in more than a decade. Now that we have taken action to reestablish price parity, we are committed to maintaining our competitiveness.\nOther Family Dollar initiatives designed to improve sales per square foot, unit sales and transaction count include: improving our store layouts through improved adjacency flow, adding linear square footage, expanding immediate consumption DSD categories and optimizing the beverage and frozen food offering. Developing private brands, we are in the process of growing and improving our private brand performance by providing shoppers more choices and a broader offering of quality products at a greater value. Over time, we believe this will enhance customer loyalty as well as our margin profile.\nWe are refining our marketing effectiveness to provide customers with convenience, value, variety and an improved shopping experience. We have evolved our print advertising calendar and format to be more relevant to our customers to drive their visit frequency. We are also in the process of relaunching our Smart Coupon program, designed to improve quality, availability, clip rate and redemptions.\nIn this changing and dynamic environment, we feel we are implementing the right plans to drive sales productivity, enhance margins and improve efficiencies to enhance the long-term benefits to each of our stakeholders. In October, Jeff Davis joined Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff brings more than 30 years of financial leadership to the organization with much of his experience coming from large retailers, including Walmart, JCPenney and Darden. Jeff is very much focused on value creation through strategic growth and strategic decision support as well as value preservation through governance and efficiency in operations. Jeff has been the company for nearly 2 months, but he is making a difference already. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to provide more color on Q3 and what's ahead of us.\n\nJeffrey A. Davis\n\nCFO, Qurate Retail Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to join the Dollar Tree team at such a pivotal time. I've been in my seat for almost 8 weeks, and I have experienced tremendous energy and excitement across the entire organization as the team is an embracing change. While the company has been around for decades, I believe we are in the early phase of significantly improving our long-term operating performance. In October, I had an opportunity to meet several of you at store visits and I look forward to connecting with a larger group in the near future. More details to come.\nSince Mike and Rick already covered our third quarter sales results, I will now move directly to the discussion of operating income. Unless otherwise stated, all third quarter comparisons are against the same period last year. To supplement my comments, we are introducing a quarterly presentation on our website at corporate.dollartree.com/investors, which outlines several key operating metrics. We hope you will find this additional information helpful to better understand our business.\nOperating income increased 22.8% to $381.3 million or 5.5% of total revenue, a 70 basis point improvement in operating income margin. This was led by a 240 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, partially offset by a 170 basis point increase in our SG&A expense rate.\nGross profit increased 17.5%. The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 520 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark-on related to the move to $1.25 price point, lower freight costs and sales leverage, partially offset by greater penetration of lower-margin consumable merchandise and product cost inflation.\nFamily Dollar's gross margin declined 100 basis points, largely due to a product mix shift and product cost inflation. We expect to see continued pressure across both segments related to the inflationary cost environment and merchandise mix as our consumable sales are expected to continue outpacing discretionary.\nSG&A as a percentage of total revenue increased 170 basis points to 24.4%. The increase is principally related to elevated repairs and maintenance as part of our commitment to improve store standards, investments in store hourly wages and higher inflationary costs across a number of expense categories, including utilities.\nCorporate support and other expenses increased 30 basis points to 1.4%, primarily from increased stock compensation expense, higher incentive comp and professional fees. From a bottom line basis, net income improved 23.1% to $266.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share in comparison to $0.96 per diluted share last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. My comments reflect balanced comparisons to the end of Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021. Combined cash and cash equivalents totaled $439 million compared to $701 million. The reduction in cash is largely attributed to the repurchase of approximately 2.86 million shares for $397.5 million in Q3 of this year. Inventory increased 31.1%, primarily from inflationary product and freight costs, expansion of $1.25 in multi-price plus inventory and store growth. Also recall last year, shoppers pulled forward purchases well ahead of the holiday season, concerned about product availability, while we were chasing trans-specific deliveries of discretionary products as our inventory levels dip well below normal operating levels. This year, shoppers purchasing behavior appears to be more closely timed to holiday dates.\nFinally, unit counts are at similar levels to October 2019. Our inventory is fresh. We have limited-dated inventory well within manageable levels. Capital expenditures were [$391.2 million] in the third quarter versus $295.6 million last year. For fiscal 2022, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $1.2 billion.\nAs we look to Q4, we see the following affecting our business. We will anniversary a significant number of Dollar Tree stores, approximately 2,500 in December and 3,000 in January, the transition to the $1.25 price point a year ago. We previously experienced an outsized benefit to comps and margins associated to the transition. The economy continues to pressure middle and low household income customers, resulting in needs-based purchasing. We expect consumables to outperform discretionary, which negatively impacts gross margin. We are cycling advanced child tax credit payments which were distributed mid-month from July to December in 2021.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we are facing higher costs from suppliers related to this inflationary environment. While at Family Dollar, we do have the flexibility to adjust price. At Dollar Tree, where we are at a fixed price points, it takes us time to adjust quantities and pack sizes for cost changes, which can lead to near-term pressure to margins. We will continue to invest in store and DC standards and expect to have higher year-over-year expenses in repairs and maintenance. In addition to being right on price, we will be right on wage as it continues to be a competitive market for talent.\nWe are raising our sales outlook for the year. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $28.14 billion to $28.28 billion compared to our previous outlook range of $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit comp sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase at Dollar Tree stores and a low single-digit increase in Family Dollar. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 2.8% as we are experiencing supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings.\nFor Q4, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $7.54 billion to $7.68 billion based on a mid- to high single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. At the end of Q2, we expected fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.40. Due to several factors, including, but not limited to, an acceleration of consumable product mix shift and elevated product cost pressure, we expect to be in the lower half of the previous outlook range.\nOther considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following: we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million. Net interest expense is expected to be $30 million in Q4 and $127 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate up 24.3% for the fourth quarter and 23.7% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 222.3 million shares for Q4 and 224.2 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of October 29, we had $1.85 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\nI'll now turn the call back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. I am proud of our team's efforts. During a period of material organizational change, a disruptive hurricane through the Southeast and macro uncertainty contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years, we delivered increases of 8.1% in sales, 17.5% in gross profit, 22.8% in operating profit and an increase of 25% in EPS. Our results continue to reinforce the relevance of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to millions of households across North America.\nAs you know, in late June, we announced that a number of executive positions would be changed. I am proud to share that by mid-November, all seats are filled, and we are very confident in the outstanding team we have built. All additions have been successful leaders throughout their careers and bring new, fresh perspectives and will enhance our progress. In addition to the executive changes, last week, we announced new leaders for several key areas of the business, including diversity, sustainability, compliance and communications. I am very confident in the team we have developed and that it will enable us to accelerate progress on our transformational journey.\nIn the months ahead, we will be refining and prioritizing our plans to ultimately deliver improved operating performance across both segments. At our spring Investor Day, we will provide you with more transparent and comprehensive view into the opportunity ahead us and the path to get there.\nBefore we transition to Q&A, I want to sincerely share my gratitude to our associates, especially in Florida and the Carolinas for their efforts during Hurricane Ian at the end of September. Their efforts through the preparation for and the recovery from this devastating storm was critical to countless families and communities we serve. In many cases, our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores were among the first to reopen to assist customers with products they needed most. Thank you to each of you. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.",

Today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to hand the conference over to Randy Guiler, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRandy Guiler\n\nVP of IR, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's Second Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Kevin Wampler.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements under the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements. For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the Risk Factors, Business, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual report filed March 15, 2022; our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter; our most recent press release and Form 8-K; and other filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution against reliance on these forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, Mike and Kevin will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nExecutive Chairman, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Mike and I and our new Board have been together for just over one quarter now. As planned and expected, change is underway, and we are moving at a fast pace. We are entirely focused on taking the right steps to transform this organization for the long term through growing and improving Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We are 90 days further down the road from our last earnings call, and the opportunity and action steps needed continue to become more clear.\nOur main priorities are our associates, the distribution network and supply chain, Family Dollar's pricing and the value proposition in both segments, store standards and technology. Additionally, and Mike will go into more detail, we have a great deal of work underway to improve the company's culture, designed to build an environment of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency and fostering two-way dialogue.\nAnd we are orchestrating these changes in one of the most unique and dynamic environments I've experienced in my retail career. Inflation is at its highest in decades as shoppers are experiencing higher costs related to food, fuel, rent and more. Supply chains have been strained and inconsistent. Inventory levels are higher across retail, and consumer shopping patterns continue to zig and zag.\nLet me be very clear. We are not here to take half measures or to defer high return capital and operating investments in order to manage earnings. We are honed in on taking steps necessary to seize the great opportunity for us and deliver to our shareholders, our associates and our customers the great company they deserve. And by executing on this commitment, we'll deliver the greatest possible risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. We'll not waver from this strategy.\nYou will hear from Mike and Kevin later in the call about some of the actions we're taking to fix Family Dollar. As you know, our new leadership team is taking shape, and the team is moving to accelerate actions to improve the business. The most notable action is our decision to move forward with price investments that began in July and will carry into the second half intended to close our historical GAAP and pricing to key competitors.\nWe believe this is a necessary action to provide the right value proposition and a foundational step to improve Family Dollar long term and that it will pay off handsomely. There is much more to do to enhance the results of Family Dollar, and you will hear about some positive improvements beginning to be made later in the call. That said, the refreshed team has been together for about a quarter, and we feel very confident in our ability to fix Family Dollar and materially improve its performance long term and in the process, create enormous value.\nWe are a growth company. We are making change happen to create long-term shareholder value and enable the next waves of profitable growth for Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. On behalf of our Board, I want to thank each of our teams for their efforts on delivering very good results for the second quarter.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are dialed in today from our Annual Field Leadership Summit. More than 1,000 leaders, including every district manager in the company, have gathered for several days to learn, collaborate and focus on all things Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is our first large in-person meeting since 2019. The energy and excitement here makes me and each of us more inspired than ever. We will transform our culture and company, and we will do this together.\nRick just mentioned that we are moving at a fast pace. The theme of our leadership summit is, in fact, Lead with Speed. I want to publicly thank all of our participants for their commitment, dedication and focus while attending this great event. I'm proud to be part of your team.\nAt these meetings, we typically talk about our company's strategy and share proof points of our collective successes. But this year is different. This year, I'm speaking to our leaders about something no less important than strategy. It's our company's culture. Every retailer has a playbook when it comes to strategy. But what sets the winning companies apart is their culture. Just as Rick mentioned, we are committed to developing a culture of accountability, empowerment, courageous leadership, transparency, and fostering two-way dialogue. We have recognized and acknowledged to ourselves that we have substantial opportunity for improvement in this respect. We have the courage to address this head on, and we would deliver the culture necessary to provide our associates, the customers and the shareholders the greatness they deserve.\nAlso at this summit, our field leaders got their first look at the initial holiday buys purchase for the new $1.25 price point. We are all excited by the compelling and relevant assortment sourced by Rick McNeely's Dollar Tree merchant team and are very confident our shoppers will be wowed by these new items and the great values over the upcoming holiday season.\nWe are undergoing a period of change, exciting change, and we have accomplished a great deal and what I'd call the first 100-plus days since our Board was reconstituted. A few months ago, we announced a number of leadership changes. We are actively engaged in recruiting leaders to the organization with the right perspectives, experiences and skill sets to help transform our company. The great opportunity before us has attracted the attention and interest of the strongest leaders in retail. In just a few months, we have already filled several key roles with exceptional talent, including Larry Gatta as Family Dollar's Chief Merchant, John Flanigan as our Head of Enterprise Supply Chain; and Bobby Aflatooni now leads our enterprise IT department.\nThis morning, we announced that Jeff Davis will be joining Dollar Tree as our new CFO. Jeff has many years of experience as a retail CFO and spent nearly a decade in executive leadership roles with one of the largest retailers. And we have carefully reviewed a field of exceptional candidates for our COO and General Counsel executive roles. The teams are gelling, and the new leaders are hitting the ground running. I look forward to sharing upcoming announcements as we round out the executive team for the next waves of growth and transformation for Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar business.\nIn light of the substantial leadership changes, I felt that we could deliver a more useful and productive event if we will defer our Investor Day from October until the spring of 2023. We will share more details on the event as it takes shape in the months ahead.\nOur second quarter performance reinforces the relevance of our brands for millions of households as they continue to face cost pressures across the board. The team delivered increases of 6.7% in sales, 14.2% in gross profit, 25.7% in operating profit and 30.1% in EPS while successfully navigating through another quarter of macro uncertainty.\nNow to Q2 performance by banner. I am pleased with the quarter delivered by Family Dollar team. The positive 2% comp represented an acceleration from Q1 on a 1-, 2- and 3-year stack basis. A 3.3% increase in average ticket more than offset a 1.2% decline in transaction count. Same-store sales were relatively balanced throughout the quarter as monthly comps range from a positive 1.5 to a positive 2.5.\nDespite supply chain challenges and OTC-related categories, the consumables comp increased 4% for the quarter. Discretionary comps declined 4.1% as shoppers continued to manage through this inflationary environment. Compared to the prior year's quarter, we saw 150 basis point swing in product mix from discretionary to consumables. In Q2, consumables represented 77.3% of Family Dollar sales compared to 75.8% in Q2 of 2021.\nThe turnaround of Family Dollar is an enormous value creation lever, and it is getting a great deal of focus and attention. Components of the transformation include, as Rick mentioned, a focus on our people, the DC network and supply chain, pricing and the value proposition as well as our technology. Additional factors include enhancing our culture, elevating store standards, developing our private brands, improving category adjacencies, enhancing the product mix, optimizing vendor partnerships and much more. We are pushing forward on each one of these fronts.\nWe are still early in this journey, but I am enthusiastic about the progress we have made just in the last few months. I want to call out, in particular, the important initiative we have taken on our pricing at Family Dollar. With the recent price investments, we believe Family Dollar is now in a better competitive position on price than it has been for over a decade. We will continue to refine the Family Dollar value proposition to drive store traffic and productivity, and we will fully expect to see great benefits from these and other actions over time.\nDuring the quarter for Family Dollar, we opened 95 new stores, renovated 257 stores and relocated 24 stores. We ended the quarter with more than 540 Combo Stores, which continue to resonate with the shoppers while driving more productivity and more profitability.\nMoving now to the Dollar Tree segment. The Dollar Tree banner delivered another strong quarter. Among the highlights, a 7.5% comp; a 37.4% gross margin, 500 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a 15.4% operating margin, more than 500 basis points over Q2 of last year. The 7.5% comp sales increase was driven by a 14.2% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 5.8%.\nImportantly, the consumable business at Dollar Tree was strong. Consumables, which represented 46.8% of the mix in Q2, comped at 7.9%, while discretionary increased 6.7%. The last time the consumable comp exceeded discretionary was at the onset of the pandemic in Q1 of 2020. This demonstrates the success we are seeing in key traffic-driving categories where our merchants have been active in enhancing value, such as carbonated beverage, snacks and cookies and food. As a reminder, our reassortment consumables has been more immediate than the discretionary merchandise given the purchasing cycle, and our sales performance demonstrates that shoppers are reacting favorably to refine the value proposition.\nRenewed consumables momentum is a good indicator for our continued long-term health of the Dollar Tree banner. The discretionary side of the business was strong despite the negative impact of the limited global supply of helium, which hindered sales of balloon products and the party-related merchandise. Regarding cadence, similar to Family Dollar, comps were relatively balanced throughout the quarter with each month's comping increasing between 6.5% and 8.5%.\nDuring the quarter for Dollar Tree, we opened 32 new stores and relocated 5 stores, and we added multi-price assortment to another 697 stores, bringing the total to 2,170 stores as we head into the back half of 2022 and the important holiday season. I would like to speak to what we are seeing in the business as consumers continue to be burdened by levels of inflation not experienced in decades.\nOverall, sales performance remains in line with our expectations. And in fact, we have modestly increased expectations for Family Dollar for the back half. There are signs of trade down to our stores, and we are focused on the value proposition for both banners in this environment. Like many retailers, we are seeing a shift in consumable preferences as many shoppers are gravitating to needs-based consumables, which is impacting our margin through product mix.\nOur suppliers are being hit with -- by inflation as well. This, along with our commitments to competitive pricing and the value proposition, is expected to negatively impact our gross margins in the near term. Over time, we believe our business should be able to protect its merchandising margin from inflation effects. And regarding supply chains, from a sourcing perspective, a year ago, we had a backlog of thousands of containers we were working to get through the transpacific shipping lanes. This year, we have a small, manageable backlog.\nKevin will go into more detail regarding our updated outlook for the back half of the year. Our outlook will be reduced with most of the guidance reduction related to the Family Dollar as we take action to improve that banner. Of the total, more than half of our guidance reduction is due to pricing actions taken at Family Dollar. The remainder is due to mix shift differences and inflationary cost increases on consumables at both banners. None of this dampens my enthusiasm for our long-term prospects.\nI'll now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q2 and our updated outlook.\n\nKevin S. Wampler\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.7% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.57 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.19 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9%. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 7.5%, and Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2%. At both banners, the increase in average ticket more than offset the decline in transaction count as shoppers continue to consolidate trips as gas prices are significantly higher than a year ago. Gross profit improved 14.2% to $2.12 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 31.4% compared to 29.4% in the prior year's quarter.\nGross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 500 basis points to 37.4% compared to 32.4% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 455 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 20 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized amounts due to increases in inventory levels partially offset by higher hourly wages and higher DC maintenance and compliance costs. And shrink increased 20 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter.\nGross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 140 basis points to 24.7% compared to 26.1% for the same period last year. The factors include markdown costs increased 80 basis points due to higher promotional and price action markdowns. Shrink increased 45 basis points primarily from more favorable results in relation to accruals in the prior year quarter. And merchandise costs, including freight, increased 15 basis points, primarily due to higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise, partially offset by higher initial mark-on.\nSimilar to Q1, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points. The SG&A rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 23% in Q2 last year with Dollar Tree favorable to prior year, more than offset by Family Dollar and slightly higher corporate costs. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 22% when compared to the prior year's quarter.\nPayroll costs improved 90 basis points from leverage on the 7.5% comp and favorable development of workers' comp claims, partially offset by the annualization of minimum wage increases and investments in store payroll; other SG&A, which increased approximately 40 basis points, resulting from unfavorable development of general liability insurance claims; and inflationary pressure across several expense categories. Facilities costs increased 10 basis points primarily from higher utility and repairs and maintenance as we focus on improving store conditions. For the Family Dollar segment, the second quarter SG&A rate increased 200 basis points to 23% compared to 21% in the prior year's quarter.\nPayroll expenses increased 70 basis points, primarily due to hourly wages and investment in store payroll and an increase in workers' compensation expense due to favorable accrual adjustments in the prior year, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Store facility costs increased 50 basis points, primarily from higher utility costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expense as we focus on improved store conditions for our customers and associates. Other SG&A expenses increased 45 basis points due to higher legal fees, debit and credit card transaction fees, store supply expense and inflationary pressure across several expense categories.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 30 basis points related to elevated capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements. Corporate support and other expense as a percentage of total revenue was 1.5% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.3%. The higher costs primarily consist of increased stock compensation costs.\nOperating income improved 25.7% to $505.4 million or 7.5% of total revenue in the second quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to a year ago. Nonoperating expenses totaled $30.7 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. The effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter, resulting from higher state tax rates and lower work opportunity tax credits as a percentage of pretax income in the current year's quarter.\nNet income for the quarter improved 27.4% to $359.9 million or $1.60 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.\nLooking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $689 million compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of July 30 was $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 1.66 million shares at an average price of $141.67 in Q2 or $235.8 million under the share repurchase authorization.\nCompared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 59.7% in dollars due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs, additional multi-price Plus inventory and a significant increase in import inventory in transit compared to the prior year. Total units per store are up approximately 20% to prepandemic Q2 2019 levels but are expected to normalize as we go through the back half of the year. The inventory is fresh and basic in nature and does not represent a significant markdown risk.\nInventory levels at Family Dollar increased 35.7% compared to Q2 last year due to increased capitalized freight and distribution costs and an increase in the average unit cost. Total units per store are below prepandemic Q2 2019 levels. Capital expenditures were $276.2 million in the second quarter versus $229.1 million in Q2 of last year. For fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion.\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $193.5 million for Q2 compared to $176.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\nAs we look to the back half of 2022, we see the following affecting our business. As Mike mentioned, we are accelerating price investments in our Family Dollar business. These investments are designed to improve the value proposition for our shoppers and to drive traffic and store productivity. This investment has a near-term impact on profit, but we expect it to accrue long-term benefit. We have seen consumer purchasing shift based on economic conditions to a more consumable-based basket at both banners, which will negatively impact our expected mix and product margin.\nDollar Tree's sales continue to be negatively affected by the global helium shortage. This directly affects balloon sales, but also has a halo effect on the entire party department. In general, stores with helium are comping positive in the party category, while those without helium are running negative comps. The delta is a 10%-plus comp differential in one of our largest high-margin discretionary categories.\nOur over-the-counter categories are being negatively affected by our supply chain challenges. This is creating a higher level of out of stocks in this category. We plan to continue to increase our investment in payroll in our stores in the back half. The labor market remains dynamic, and we are proactively addressing select markets to attract and retain associates. We are making investments in our stores and distribution centers through repairs and maintenance as well as compliance programs to ensure a great shopping and working environment.\nBased on these factors, diluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.10 to $7.40. This represents a $0.75 per share adjustment to the prior outlook based on the midpoint and is comprised of the following components. Roughly 60% of the change relates to the price investments at Family Dollar. An estimated 20% of the change relates to the margin impact of the mix shift towards needs-based consumables, projected to be a 300 basis point shift at Family Dollar and a 150 basis point shift at Dollar Tree in the back half. Again, the majority of this impact is expected to be on the Family Dollar side of the business.\nWe are experiencing some degree of inflationary-related product cost increases, especially in lower-margin consumables, primarily at Dollar Tree, contributing to approximately 15% of the guide adjustment. As we have for decades, we have the ability to alter or reassort product based on cost changes, but this can take a few quarters, hence the near-term profit impact. And a small component of the guide adjustment relates to other items, including our commitment to improve store conditions.\nAs a result of the aforementioned factors, most notably our accelerated price investment, we are expecting Family Dollar to be approximately breakeven from a segment operating margin perspective in the second half, down from its first half margin of approximately 2%. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.85 billion to $28.10 billion with slightly higher comps offset by slightly reduced square footage growth relative to prior guidance. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a positive increase in the Family Dollar segment.\nSelling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.5%, down slightly from prior guidance due to the supply chain delays related to procuring equipment and fixtures for store openings. For Q3, we estimate consolidated net sales will range from $6.75 billion to $6.87 billion based on a mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.20 per share.\nOther considerations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million in Q3 and $125 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.6% for the third quarter and 23.8% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224.8 million shares for Q3 and 225.4 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. As of July 30, we had $2.25 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\nAnd I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. As we continue to navigate through this dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment, we are excited about the continued progress at Dollar Tree and the material positive changes beginning to be made at Family Dollar. At Dollar Tree, as it relates to our multi-price offering, the team is continuing to refine the $3 and $5 assortment and testing various concepts to enhance the program and build on the very positive long-term impact from our multi-price offering.\nFor example, test of multi-price frozen foods are driving exceptional sales productivity as the new offering is delivering tremendous value and meeting family portion needs such as frozen meals, pizza and ice cream. At Family Dollar, our Combo Store initiative continues to drive improved store performance at very attractive levels, in line with previous commentary. In fact, we are now exploring various sizes and formats in other markets beyond our rural target locations, pursued in our first iteration of the concept.\nSome of the initiatives to improve the business will take more time to produce an impact, notably in the supply chain and technology. That said, at Family Dollar, the work being done by Larry Gatta's merchandising and marketing teams has been remarkable and is beginning to be actioned upon more urgently. In fact, we have made a number of enhancements to our H2 strategic store format. We refer to the new version as H2.5. Among the changes made to improve store productivity, customer satisfaction and to better support our store associates through efficiencies include: adding a linear footage, developing seasonal assortments as a focal point, utilizing deeper shelving on key consumable categories to enhance store efficiencies and improve in-stocks, expanding the direct-to-store delivery offering, enhancing space dedicated to snacks and increasing the beverage offering and optimizing the frozen food assortments.\nAt our Leadership Summit, the merchandising team shared the field leaders a wide array of consumables and discretionary merchandising initiatives to drive traffic and sales at Family Dollar. Our marketing teams are currently focused on 4 key initiatives: refreshing Family Dollar's brand positioning, evolving to a more productive ad program, relaunching our Smart Coupon program and expanding our Boys & Girls Clubs of America partnership to be a good partner in the communities that we serve.\nWe believe that these key initiatives are beginning to have an impact, and consumers are increasingly looking to our stores to meet their needs. We believe the time is right to accelerate actions to better serve customers by providing an exceptional value proposition. We will go into more details on these initiatives and broader plans to transform Family Dollar and continue delivering great success at Dollar Tree in the quarters ahead and at our Investor Day in the spring of 2023.\nAnd I want to briefly share a few initiatives that Bobby Aflatooni's IT team are focused on to provide better support for our stores. These include: improving DC and store in-stock service levels through refinement of our demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment systems for both banners; improving customer satisfaction and driving through enhanced ability to support more complex promotional offers, such as buy a product A and get a discount on the product B; supporting field leadership and store efficiencies with improved labor systems; and enhancing our enterprise-wide data integration platforms.\nBefore we go into Q&A, as I had previously announced, Kevin will be transitioning out of his role as Dollar Tree's CFO. Kevin has been instrumental in the company's growth and success since joining the organization in 2008. During Kevin's tenure, Dollar Tree has grown from 3,600 stores to more than 16,200 stores, from annual sales of $4.6 billion to more than $26 billion and from annual operating profits of $365 million to more than $1.8 billion. When Kevin joined Dollar Tree in December 2008, shares were trading at a split adjusted price of just $13 or $14 per share. I would like to publicly thank Kevin for his commitment, stewardship and significant contributions to Dollar Tree and its stakeholders over the last 14 years.\nOperator, we are now ready to take questions.",

First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRandy Guiler\n\nVP of IR, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss results for Dollar Tree's First Fiscal Quarter 2022. With me on today's call are Executive Chairman, Rick Dreiling; President and CEO, Mike Witynski; and CFO, Kevin Wampler.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about our expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. For information on the risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the Risk Factors, Business and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in our annual report filed March 15, 2022, our Form 10-Q for the most recently ended fiscal quarter, our most recent press release and 8-K and other filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution against reliance on the forward-looking statements made today, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements, except as required by law.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, Mike and Kevin will take your questions. (Operator Instructions). And before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to make one quick clarification to our earnings release as I've received a few questions this morning. Our original fiscal 2022 EPS outlook of $7.60 to $8 per share did not include the $0.43 per share of cost outlined in today's earnings release. $0.13 of the $0.43 per share was incurred in Q1 and reduced our Q1 earnings. Our updated outlook for EPS of $7.80 to $8.20 per share does include the $0.43 per share of cost.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard W. Dreiling\n\nExecutive Chairman, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. It's been an extremely busy 10 weeks since joining the Dollar Tree team. I've been actively meeting with the leaders throughout the organization to get to know them and their businesses and to discuss priorities and opportunities. We see a massive opportunity ahead of us to drive long-term sustainable value creation through the combined Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. It's abundantly clear to us that to deliver this long-term opportunity, we're going to be going from a great company and that change is needed.\nWe are fully committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company today to a great company tomorrow. We have this unique opportunity to become a growth engine that delivers profitable growth with attractive returns on capital for many years to come. However, to get from here to there, we must build the foundation to fuel this engine. We need to invest in the areas that most positively impact the associate and shopper experience. These investments are intended to greatly improve the performance of the Family Dollar segment and our supply chain as well as support the continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\nWe'll be focusing on our people, most importantly, our teams from store and distribution center associates to field leadership through competitive wages, improved store and DC conditions and enhanced safety. The distribution center network and supply chain presents us with a golden opportunity to amplify efficiencies and deliver greater support to our stores and elevated service to our shoppers through improved in-stock positions.\nPricing at Family Dollar and the value proposition at both banners, we need to be right on price at Family Dollar, on par with our primary competitors, and we will work directly with our suppliers to drive greater store productivity. Dollar Tree has a long history of exceeding customer expectations by offering extreme value. We will continue to place a great emphasis on the value proposition at Dollar Tree.\nAnd finally, technology. We are simply not where we need to be from a systems perspective to reach our potential. We have recently begun a comprehensive review of all of our systems and infrastructure to make the right decisions and investments to take Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to the next level.\nI felt great about the long-term opportunity for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar before I got here. Now that I've been inside the organization for 2 months, I feel better than ever. I have full confidence in the team and our Board of Directors as we embark on this much needed transformational growth journey. The Dollar Tree banner is generating renewed momentum, and we will be taking the necessary steps to enable Family Dollar to seize the opportunity to deliver long-term operating performance improvements.\nWe are in the midst of a very challenging time for consumers as many are living paycheck to paycheck. They are facing the highest inflation since the early 1980s, record high gas prices, the effects from the pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty and much more. In tough times, value retail can be part of the solution to help families stretch their dollars to meet their evolving needs. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar provide convenience as our 16,000-plus stores are located close to millions of households to live and work.\nMike and I view our organization as a growth company. Now is the ideal time to shift gears for us to make change happen to unlock shareholder value and enable the next wave of profitable growth for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. And it's good to have you here with us, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The team delivered a solid start to the year with a 6.5% top line sales expansion, a 19.2% lift to gross profit and a 48.1% increase to earnings per share. During the quarter, the Dollar Tree team successfully completed its conversion to the $1.25 price point, contributing to both sales and margin improvements. Shoppers are responding favorably as the new greater value products hit our shelves.\nImportantly, other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of the $3 and $5 Plus assortment in our Dollar Tree stores, as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar are all working. Rick outlined the types of additional strategic investments we will be making over the next several years that are designed to position the company for improved operating performance and long-term sustainable growth.\nBefore I discuss Q1 performance by segment, I want to share a few details regarding a very eventful quarter for the company. In mid-March, our Board was reconstituted. We now have a new Executive Chair, a new Vice Chair and Lead Director -- Lead Independent Director and a total of 7 new directors. We also have 2 new Board committees, a Finance Committee and a Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.\nThis week, we published our new 2022 CSR report. I am proud of the progress we are making as a company and the team's effort on sustainability. Please check out the new CSR report in the Corporate Governance portion of our website at DollarTreeinfo.com.\nRick and I have been working very closely together. We share a common vision for a long-term growth opportunity for the Dollar Tree organization. That value will be created by a combination of Dollar Tree's unique and resilient business model that is demonstrating its earnings power and momentum with its recent initiatives, along with a material improvement over time, and the operating performance of our Family Dollar banner. We are well underway with plans and priorities to address the performance at Family Dollar. I will share more detail later on this call.\nAlso, 2 weeks ago, we announced the addition of 2 key executives to our leadership team. John Flanigan joined the company as Chief Supply Chain Officer. John brings decades of leadership experience in retail logistics, including grocery, drugstore and the value sectors. John will be extremely focused on elevating our supply chain capabilities through improved distribution operations, hiring and retaining of teams, the efficiency improvements throughout supply chain designed to drive greater store productivity through improved in-stock position. He plans to lead productivity improvements across the logistics function by the use of data analytics, process improvement and automation.\nAdditionally, Larry Gatta has joined the team as Chief Merchandising Officer for the Family Dollar segment. Larry brings more than 35 years of retail merchandising and marketing experience. He is well known and respected throughout the vendor community and will be leading plans to drive our business, and in turn, the business of our supply partners. Larry will be focused on improving Family Dollar's operating performance and productivity through sales-driving initiatives that provide great value for our shoppers.\nIn addition to the investments we are outlining today, components of our transformation were driven by a number of factors, including continuing to enhance our culture, elevated store standards, better use of private brands, improved category adjacencies, enhancing our product mix, optimizing our vendor partnerships and many, many more.\nTo some degree today, and especially in the quarters ahead, you can expect to receive more details, improved transparency and greater management engagement in shareholder communications as we progress on our plans to improve the operating performance and reassess the long-term opportunities for the company. We are currently in the process of planning an Investor Day targeted for October time frame.\nNow to Q1 performance. The Dollar Tree banner delivered its strongest quarter in company history. Among the highlights: an 11.2% comp, the best quarterly comp performance in more than 20 years, which is including our largest sales day ever, which was the Saturday before Easter; a 40.6% gross profit margin, nearly 700 basis points above the prior year's quarter; and a company record 20.2% operating margin, more than 800 basis points over Q1 of last year.\nMargins in Q1 did receive an outsized temporary benefit from the initial transition to the new price point as well as selling through the current inventories. We are modeling a moderation of the margin level as we focus on providing our shoppers with new assortments at greater value for the $1.25 price point. The 11.2% comp sales increase was driven by a 15.4% increase in average ticket partially offset by a traffic decline of 3.6%. For the quarter, the discretionary side of the business delivered a strong 14.1% comp increase, while consumables increased 8%. April, which benefited from the later Easter holiday this year, was the strongest month in terms of both sales and traffic.\nImportantly, we successfully completed the conversion to a primary price point of $1.25 across the chain. Credit to our teams. This project was announced in September of 2021 and was completed by the end of February with minimal disruption. By the end of Q1, our customers have already seen more than 960 of our projected 2,000 new greater value product SKUs on the shelves. Our shoppers are responding to the new items. We are seeing much improved results in the categories since rolling out the enhanced offering.\nExamples of the consumables category comp improvements where we've put in these new items: carbonated beverage, from a 3% decline to a 12% increase now; in snacks and cookies, before the new SKUs, we had a decline of 8%, now a 12% increase in comp; and in our food category, from a 10% decline before to now experiencing a 2% increase. The majority of the changes at this early stage are now traffic-driving consumable side of the business. The discretionary changes will occur throughout the back half of the year.\nThe $1.25 assortment changes are notable and easy to see when you visit Dollar Tree stores. In today's environment, where consumers are seeing higher prices everywhere, shoppers know they can rely on Dollar Tree as their destination for extreme value and evolving meaningful assortment and a thrill of the hunt.\nThe Family Dollar banner had a big hurdle to climb in Q1. In 2020, Family Dollar had a 15.5% quarterly comp increase at the onset of COVID. And in last year's quarter, there was a record release of stimulus dollars that positively impacted both top line sales and margin with the lift in discretionary sales.\nFor Q1, Family Dollar's comps declined 2.8%, which represents a nearly 10% comp since 2019. The 2.8% comp sales decrease was comprised of 3.7% decline in traffic partially offset by a 1% increase in average ticket. For the quarter, the consumable side of the business delivered a 1.2% comp increase, while discretionary comps were down 14.7% as we cycled the massive release of stimulus dollars last year. February represented the best comp month for the quarter, and April was slightly better than the quarter's comp.\nImportantly, Family Dollar's comp sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 200 basis points by the temporary closures of approximately 400 Family Dollar stores served by our Arkansas distribution center. All of these stores have now reopened.\nLast week, we announced that we will be closing the 30-year-old West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center that we have deemed is no longer part of our go-forward strategy. We are working closely with the impacted associates to support them with their transitions by providing severance plans to those eligible, helping associates with opportunities in our other distribution centers and in our stores as well as providing outplacement services and employee assistant programs. We are reallocating stores to other DCs to fulfill the store deliveries and have sufficient capacity to serve all stores in our remaining fleet of distribution centers. We appreciate the hard work and support of West Memphis associates committed during the transition process.\nI will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide more color on Q1 and our updated outlook.\n\nKevin S. Wampler\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 6.5% to $6.9 billion comprised of $3.78 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.12 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.4% despite cycling the large outflow of stimulus from the prior year's quarter. This represented a 190 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.\nCosts for the Dollar Tree segment increased 11.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%. And on a 3-year stack basis, Dollar Tree is at a 15% comp, and Family Dollar is at a 9.9% comp. Gross profit improved 19.2% to $2.34 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 33.9% compared to 30.3% in the prior year's quarter.\nGross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment increased 690 basis points to 40.6% compared to 33.7% for the same period last year as a result of the net of the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 590 basis points, primarily due to increased initial mark-on and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise, partially offset by higher freight costs. Occupancy costs decreased 80 basis points from leverage on the comp sales increase. Distribution costs decreased 50 basis points from leverage and higher capitalized balances resulting from inventory increases in the current quarter partially offset by higher hourly wages. And markdown costs increased 30 basis points primarily from markdowns for clearance items as we move to a higher value assortment at the $1.25 price point.\nGross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased 100 basis points to 25.8% compared to 26.8% for the same period last year. Markdown costs increased 75 basis points due to higher clearance activity related to the shipping delays for seasonal items and slow-moving merchandise. Occupancy costs increased 45 basis points from deleverage from the comparable store sales decrease and higher real estate taxes.\nShrink increased 25 basis points for more favorable inventory results in relation to accruals in the prior year's quarter. These increases were partially offset by distribution costs that decreased 15 basis points, primarily from higher capitalized balances from inventory increases, partially offset by our higher hourly wages. And merchandise costs, including freight, decreased 35 basis points primarily due to higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher freight costs and higher sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points to 23.3% compared to 22.3% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 20.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 100 basis points from leverage on the 11.2% comp partially offset by hourly wages and investments in store payroll.\nFacility costs improved 25 basis points from leverage. Depreciation costs decreased approximately 10 basis points, partially offset by other SG&A, which increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from higher store supply costs.\nFor the Family Dollar segment, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 280 basis points to 23% compared to 20.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll expenses increased 90 basis points primarily due to hourly wage and investment in store payroll as well as deleverage on the comp sales decline.\nOther SG&A expenses increased 85 basis points due to asset impairment for the West Memphis DC, along with higher store supply expenses for store projects and higher legal fees. Store facility costs increased 65 basis points primarily from costs associated with removal of product from stores in connection with the voluntary product recall as well as deleverage on the comp decline. And depreciation and amortization increased 40 basis points due to increased depreciation related to capital expenditures for store renovations and improvements.\nCorporate, support and Other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 1.8% compared to the prior year quarter of 1.4%. The higher costs related to increased legal fees, including the reconstitution of our Board, and incentive compensation.\nOperating income improved 40.7% to $731.5 million or 10.6% of total revenue in the first quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34 million comprised of net interest expense, and the effective tax rate was 23.1% for both the current and prior year's quarter. Net income for the quarter improved 43.2% to $536.4 million or $2.30 per diluted share, which includes $0.13 per share for costs related to the West Memphis DC. This compared to net earnings of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\nLooking at the balance sheet. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.22 billion compared to $985 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Outstanding debt as of April 30 were $3.45 billion. The company repurchased approximately 90,000 shares in Q1 for approximately $14.2 million under the share repurchase authorization.\nCompared to last year, inventory levels at Dollar Tree are up 39% due to increased capitalized freight costs plus Dollar Tree Plus inventory and a catch-up in past due inventories. Inventory levels at Family Dollar increased 27% compared to (inaudible) last year due to increased capitalized freight and an increase in the average unit cost. Both banners have less average inventory units in store than at the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic.\nCapital expenditures were $253.4 million in the first quarter versus $224.9 million in Q1 of last year. And for fiscal 2022, we currently expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately (inaudible), slightly higher than our initial outlook for the year based on additional supply chain projects and construction cost pressures.\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $188.9 million for Q1 compared to $172.7 million in the first quarter of the last year. And for fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $770 million.\nIn March, our initial outlook for fiscal 2022, diluted EPS was a range of $7.60 to $8. We expect to incur costs totaling an estimated $0.43 per share, which were not included in our original outlook. These costs represent: in Q1, $0.13 per share for asset impairment and the product recall costs related to our West Memphis DC; for Q2, an estimated $0.22 per share for lost sales, freight, merchandise disposal, payroll and legal costs associated with the West Memphis matter; and for full year fiscal 2022, a total of $0.08 per share for stock compensation expense related to an option grant issued to our new Executive Chairman.\nDiluted earnings per share for the full year is now expected to range from $7.80 to $8.20, which includes the $0.43 of costs I've just outlined. Consolidated net sales for the year are now expected to range from $27.76 billion to $28.14 billion compared to our previous range of $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit comparable store sales increase for the year comprised of a high single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a more or less flat comparable store sales in the Family Dollar segment. Selling square footage is expected to grow by approximately 3.9%.\nFor Q2, we estimate consolidated net sales to range from $6.65 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low to mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and this estimate includes approximately $0.24 per share for costs for the West Memphis matter and stock compensation expense.\nConsiderations for our updated 2022 outlook include the following. We anticipate that we will continue to experience uncertainty related to inflation, the global supply chain and geopolitical factors. For example, we have seen diesel costs continue to rise, and natural gas price increases are affecting utility costs throughout the business. We are once again experiencing shortages in the availability of helium and have not been able to procure the volume [to fulfill our] needs, which will negatively affect balloon sales. Our outlook includes our best current estimates of pressures from these factors.\nWe cycled the third round of stimulus checks that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021. In Q2, we will begin cycling the monthly advance Child Tax Credit payments that began in mid-July of 2021.\nWe noted that our original outlook in March that we expected to invest $195 million in store and DC associate wages in 2022. As an update, given the competitive retail environment, we expect that we will likely exceed this amount as we invest in our associates.\nImport domestic freight will present cost pressures due to annualization of fiscal '21 rates in the first half of 2022. As noted in March, we plan for diesel fuel prices to be higher this year. We have increased the forecasted amount for the remainder of the year based on the current market. Additional color for the year regarding our expectations include, for the enterprise, we are forecasting improved operating margin for the business driven by gross margin improvements, partially offset by higher SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenue.\nThe Dollar Tree segment gross margin in Q1 included an outsized benefit from the transition to the new $1.25 price point. We expect to see a gross margin moderation from the Q1 level as new greater value assortments are incorporated into the business. The Dollar Tree segment is expected to deliver improved operating margin for the year with gross margin benefiting from its strategic initiatives as well as leverage on SG&A.\nThe Family Dollar segment gross and operating margins are expected to be lower year-over-year, impacted by the following: higher costs, including freight and needed investments in the business such as labor and improved store conditions; the impact to product mix as a result of stimulus dollars driving discretionary sales in the prior year; and the impact on sales and expenses related to the West Memphis DC matter.\nNet interest expense is expected to be approximately (inaudible) in Q2 and $123 million for the year. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.2% for the second quarter and 24% for fiscal 2022. Weighted average diluted share count are assumed to be 226.4 million shares for Q2 and 226.5 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchase. And as of April 30, we had $2.5 billion remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. As Rick mentioned in the opening, we are committed to transform Dollar Tree from a good company to a great company. Our initiatives are working and providing increased profits and cash flow. Rick and I both believe now is the ideal time to accelerate investments focused on driving growth through improved associate and shopper experience while propelling greater efficiencies.\nThese strategic initiatives will be designed to position Dollar Tree for long-term sustainable growth. And we are going to invest and incur costs associated with making this journey. It's the right thing to do, and this is the ideal time to invest in our future. Again, to reiterate, we will be investing in our associates and our stores, the DC network and supply chain, Family Dollar pricing and the value proposition and our technology.\nBoth Rick and I are committed, aligned and extremely focused. The ability to execute our key strategic initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance and accelerated growth. We believe an -- we delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021. And the midpoint of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase. I believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power into the years ahead.\nWe are committed to meeting our customers' needs while investing in initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders, associates, customers, suppliers and our shareholders. We all know it is incredibly challenging and uncertain time for the businesses today.\nWe believe our company offers the following as we manage through these times: stable and resilient business model that has worked at good times and in bad; a 16,000 store footprint that is convenient for shoppers buying their needs; a tremendous value assortment that helps shoppers stretch their budgets; a strong balance sheet that enables us to invest in our business while enhancing our ability to manage and maneuver through the current environment effectively; a road map to deliver shareholder value through improved performance at Family Dollar and improved supply chain and a continued momentum at Dollar Tree.\nWe have a fantastic growth story of opening 590 new stores this year alone, driving top line sales growth through key initiatives and, again, an expected 38% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint of our range.\nOperator, Kevin and I are now ready to take questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike Witynski, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThank you, Randy. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm extremely proud of the team's strong performance during our transformative fourth quarter. We delivered comparable sales increases at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, both representing improvements from the prior quarter on a 2-year stacked basis. Our EPS of $2.01 exceeded our $1.69 to $1.79 guidance range.\nImportantly, we recently completed a successful conversion to $1.25 price point across all Dollar Tree stores in the United States, more than 2 months ahead of schedule, which significantly enhances our ability to provide a meaningful assortment at extreme values to our shoppers. We continue to have terrific performance on other key strategic initiatives, including the expansion of our $3 and $5-plus assortments to another 1,500 Dollar Tree stores as well as our Combo Stores and H2 renovations at Family Dollar.\nThe Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 3.1%, cycling a 2.4% increase from the prior year's quarter. A 5.5% 2-year stack quarterly comp was our best of the year and represented a sequential improvement of 90 basis points from Q3. Discretionary continues to perform extremely well at a 5.4% comp.\nWe are continuing to experience record sell-throughs of our seasonal and holiday merchandise. The strongest-performing categories included candy, Christmas seasonal, party celebrations, crafts and stationery. For the quarter, discretionary represented more than 57% of our sales, up 130 basis points from the prior year's quarter.\nFor the Dollar Tree banner, December was the strongest comp month of the quarter as we were cycling a slight negative from the prior year. November was a low single-digit positive comp, and January was our lowest comp month as we cycled the strongest comp month of the prior year's quarter.\nFamily Dollar delivered a positive 1.7% comp against the 8.1% increase a year ago. This represented the fourth consecutive quarter that Family Dollar 2-year comp stack exceeded 9%. The consumable side of the business comped just below a positive 3%, while the discretionary was a low single-digit negative as we are cycling stimulus dollars from the prior year. The Family Dollar business continues to gain share. The strongest-performing categories include pet, candy and snack and beverage. For the quarter, consumables represented just over 73% of sales.\nAt Family Dollar, November was our strongest comp month of the quarter, closely followed by December. Both periods were above the quarterly comp of 1.7%. January was a negative comp as we cycled a double-digit comp from the prior year related to the release of stimulus dollars. Additionally, retail in January was impacted by Omicron variant, much colder and stormier weather than the prior year and the lapsing of the monthly child tax credit advanced payments. The comps at both banners were again driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction count.\nLast week, we completed the rollout of our $1.25 price point initiative to every Dollar Tree store across the U.S., more than 7,800-plus stores. This milestone completed more than 2 months ahead of our targeted date is a testament to the commitment and teamwork between our support teams, our merchandising organizations and our field leadership teams, demonstrating our ability to execute. This strategic endeavor will enable Dollar Tree to ultimately drive store traffic and productivity, customer loyalty and operating performance while enhancing our ability to navigate the business through higher periods of higher cost.\nWe have been considering this move for some time. In recent years, we have lost many items that are customer favorites and key traffic-driving consumable products from our assortment due to the constraints of the $1 price point. Additionally, we have been operating through a higher cost environment as it relates to inflation, tariffs, supply chain and labor costs. The new $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand our assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials at a great value.\nIn preparation for this move, our merchandising teams have taken on the Herculean task of reviewing thousands of product SKU by SKU or item by item to reassess the value through comp shops of our competitors. Many of our products, especially on the seasonal and discretionary side, are still considered to be an extreme value at the new $1.25 price point.\nFor those products that are considered new or to be reinvested in with the larger quantities or package sizes, we have a clear -- a very clear and focused and urgent plan to bring that product into our stores. These assortment changes will be taking place throughout the year, but we do expect 50% of the categories, new and revested in products, to be in the store by midyear. Example of the products already in the stores are carbonated beverages and salty snacks, all at the $1.25 price point.\nI could not be more proud of our team's smooth execution of the transition to the $1.25 price point. Initially, we rolled out the program to a diverse segment of more than 100 stores across the U.S. Then we expanded to nearly 200 stores across 3 metropolitan markets. And starting in December, we embarked on 7 waves of multistate introductions. The signage, training and talking points equipped our field leadership teams to execute the store's checklist to complete the transitions. The teams embraced the project, rolled up their sleeves and got it done. Feedback from our shoppers has indicated they clearly understood the change in pricing. Stores were easy to shop, and the signage was very clear.\nThe key has always been and always will be enabling us to deliver extreme value to our customers. We are focused on exceeding shopper expectations for the value at $1.25, just like we have been at the $1 price point for more than 30 years.\nWe have been closely tracking the performance of converted stores on a daily basis item by item, category by category. We have seen relatively consistent reaction in performance across various demographics, geographies and store sizes. Among our findings are the following. Our new and reinvested SKUs are driving improved performance in their categories, including in the food, snack and beverage, which are all very important traffic-driving categories. Our seasonal and discretionary continue to outperform consumable, but we believe this can balance out as we continue to modify the assortment on the consumables and deliver greater value for our customers.\nAs you would expect, we are seeing comp lift sales to the stores that have transitioned to $1.25, partially offset by a decline in unit sales in the teens. As we go through the year, we expect to see a greater lift to the gross margin in the first half of the year as we sell through the current inventory. And importantly, as I have stated before, we have confidence we can get back to our historic 35% to 36% annual gross margin range this year even with the continuation of elevated freight costs. And as we reinvest in the key categories to deliver extreme value, we expect to see improved traffic and productivity as we move throughout the year.\nI've shared much about the $1.25 price point as it is where many investors are focused, and it is transforming our company. But I want to be clear that we are very pleased with the continued progress we are seeing across each of our strategic initiatives.\nRegarding Dollar Tree Plus, we finished the year with a multi-price product in approximately 660 stores, well beyond our original target of 500 stores. At Dollar Tree, our $3 and $5-plus assortment will be expanded to another 1,500 stores in fiscal '22. Customers are responding very well to holiday, seasonal and discretionary categories, and we will continue to grow and improve this initiative.\nAt Family Dollar, our Combo Stores are working. Customers love shopping the best of Family Dollar and Dollar Tree in one easy-to-shop local store in their community. The stores are driving a material comp sales lift, increased productivity, higher gross margins and improved operating performance. We ended the year with more than 240 Combo Stores and are planning to add another 400 Combo Stores this year.\nWe ended the year with 3,815 Family Dollar stores in the H2 format. We are planning for another 800 H2 store reservations in fiscal 2022, which we believe will bring our store fleet current and will enable us to reallocate time, effort, resources and capital from the renovation program to other value-creating initiatives as we move forward.\nI will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q4 performance and our outlook for fiscal 2022.\n\nKevin S. Wampler\n\nCFO, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 4.6% to $7.08 billion, comprised of $3.92 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.16 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.5% as we cycled a 4.9% increase from a year ago, representing a 70 basis point improvement from Q3 to 7.4% on a 2-year stacked basis. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 3.1%. Family Dollar same-store sales increased 1.7%, cycling a strong 8.1% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 5.5%, which was a 90 basis point improvement from Q3. And Family Dollar increased 9.8%, which was a 70 basis point improvement from Q3.\nDollar Tree's comp was comprised of a 6% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.8% decline in traffic. Family Dollar experienced a 4.6% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 2.7% decline in traffic. Gross profit was $2.14 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 30.2% compared to 31.8% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 50 basis points to 35.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter.\nFactors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 110 basis points driven by higher freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark-on and increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise. This increase was partially offset by shrink that improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.\nDistribution costs improved approximately 20 basis points, resulting primarily from lower COVID-19-related expenses and sales leverage, partially offset by higher hourly wages. And occupancy costs decreased approximately 10 basis points as a result of the leverage from the comp sales increase in the quarter.\nGross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 320 basis points to 23.4% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs and an unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by higher initial mark-on. Markdowns increased 90 basis points primarily related to our recent product recall in our Arkansas distribution center in 404 Family Dollar stores.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 40 basis points to 22.1% of total revenue compared to 21.7% in Q4 last year. For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue increased 50 basis points to 20.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A increased approximately 50 basis points, resulting from higher card transaction fees and operating taxes, along with marketing and store supply costs associated with the transition to the $1.25 price point.\nPayroll costs increased 10 basis points, resulting primarily from higher store hourly payroll costs due to minimum wage increases and higher health care costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. And depreciation cost decreased 15 basis points primarily due to lower store impairment write-offs and leverage due to the increase in comp store sales.\nFor Family Dollar, the fourth quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue increased 10 basis points to 20.7% compared to 20.6% in the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A expense increased 25 basis points primarily due to lower miscellaneous income, an increase in card transaction fees and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 basis points due to higher store asset impairment charges and expenditures associated with the store renovation program.\nStore facility costs increased 5 basis points primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance expenses, including snow removal, partially offset by lower telecommunication expenses. And payroll expenses improved 35 basis points primarily due to lower incentive compensation and field management vacancies, partially offset by higher store hourly payroll, resulting from higher labor rates.\nCorporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue were flat when compared to the prior year's quarter at 1.4%. Operating income was $578.8 million or 8.2% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Nonoperating expenses totaled $79.6 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense, including debt extinguishment costs of $46.5 million associated with our debt refinancing in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 9% compared to 22.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter, resulting primarily from a deferred tax benefit related to state entity restructuring.\nCompany had net income of $454.2 million or $2.01 per diluted share. This compared to net earnings of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $984.9 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of January 29 was $3.45 billion.\nFor the year, the company repurchased $950 million in shares at an average price of $103.75. The company did not repurchase shares during the fourth quarter as our Board has engaged in discussions with Mantle Ridge. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\nCompared to the prior year, inventory levels increased 39% at Dollar Tree and 17% at Family Dollar. The higher levels of inventory are comprised of significant increases in goods on the water year-over-year as we rebuild inventory levels as well as increased capitalized freight costs based on much higher rates during the year. We do not anticipate any additional material inventory markdowns related to the recent Family Dollar voluntary product recall.\nCapital expenditures were $271.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $191.8 million in Q4 last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect that consolidated CapEx will be approximately $1.3 billion, which will be focused on 590 new stores, consisting of 400 Family Dollar and 190 Dollar Tree stores; 1,500 Dollar Tree Plus additions and 800 Family Dollar H2 renovations; the addition or replacement of frozen or refrigerated capability to select Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores; supply chain construction and upgrades and information technology system projects.\nDepreciation amortization totaled $188.7 million for Q4 compared to $182.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2022, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $750 million.\nOur initial outlook for fiscal 2022 includes the following assumptions. For same-store sales for the enterprise, we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit positive comps for the year. Considerations for 2022 include the following. The company incurred approximately $33.5 million in COVID-19-related costs in fiscal 2021. We expect these costs to be minimal in fiscal 2022. We will be cycling the third round of stimulus check that totaled an estimated $386 billion in March of 2021. And later in the year, we will be cycling the monthly advanced child tax credit payments that began in July of 2021.\nWe expect continued pressure on store and DC payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages, unemployment levels and completing the company's many initiatives. We expect to incur more than $165 million in store minimum wage changes and market adjustments. In addition, we are investing more than $30 million in DC hourly wages. We continue to partially offset these average hourly rate increases through productivity and efficiency initiatives.\nImport and domestic freight will present cost pressures due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates in the first half of 2022. In addition, diesel fuel prices are expected to be significantly higher in 2022. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we've not adjusted our outlook for the currency rate changes.\nNet interest expense is expected to be approximately $33 million for Q1 and approximately $129 million for fiscal 2022. We estimate consolidated net sales for the first quarter will range from $6.63 billion to $6.78 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.10. Consolidated net sales for full fiscal 2022 are expected to range from $27.22 billion to $27.85 billion. The company estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $7.60 to $8, which at the high end implies a consolidated operating income margin of 9%.\nOur outlook assumes a tax rate of 24.3% for the first quarter and 24.1% for fiscal 2022. Our weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 226.5 million shares for Q1 and 226.7 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. And as previously mentioned, we currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\nI'll turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Witynski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Dollar Tree, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. I am more encouraged and enthusiastic about our business and the opportunity than ever before. After a few years of Dollar Tree delivering operating margins lower than we like, I believe we are poised to benefit from our initiatives to deliver materially improved operating performance.\nBecause of our team's dedication, focus and execution, we have one of the most important milestones behind us: converting more than 7,800 stores to the new pricing strategy. Providing value to our customers and a meaningful assortment is at the forefront. And as we reinvest in and market the extreme value assortment at Dollar Tree, we are confident store traffic and productivity will improve throughout the year, which will contribute to shopper loyalty.\nValue and convenience is more important than ever to our customer in today's environment. We are dedicated, aligned and focused. The ability to execute our key initiatives is paying off and setting a solid foundation for improved operating performance. We delivered an EPS of $5.80 in fiscal 2021, and the high end of our guidance range this year is $8, representing a 38% increase.\nI believe we are at an inflection point to exhibit our earnings power in the years ahead. This year, we are laser-focused on meeting our customer needs while driving our initiatives that are delivering the best returns. These initiatives, combined with our robust balance sheet, will position us to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders, customers, associates, suppliers and our shareholders.\nI would like to once again thank every one of our more than 200,000 associates for all they have accomplished over the past 2 years through the unprecedented challenges presented with COVID-19 supply chain issues and labor shortages. Our teams are there every day to serve millions of shoppers across the U.S. and Canada. We have accomplished quite a lot in the last 18 months, but in many ways, I feel that we are just getting started. But the future is bright for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.\nBefore we take your questions, I'd like to provide a brief update on our ongoing engagement with Mantle Ridge. We continue to have constructive dialogue with Mantle Ridge and our shareholders. And indeed, we have been meeting weekly with Paul Hilal of Mantel Ridge and Rick Dreiling. Accordingly, we will not be addressing any Mantle Ridge-related questions during the Q&A portion of our earnings call.\nOperator, we are now ready to take questions.",

Joining the call from the company today are Mr. Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Gary Fritz, President of MGM Interactive; Kenneth Feng, Executive Director and President of MGM China Holdings Hubert Wang, COO and President of MGM China Holdings; and Howard Wang, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Wang. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward H. Wang\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks. Welcome to the MGM Resorts International Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or otherwise. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Our industry is constantly changing, and MGM is always moving forward, proactively navigating with agility and allocating capital with discipline to best position our company for future success. One example of our capital discipline was a challenging decision to withdraw our application for commercial license in Yonkers, New York. We dedicated significant time and resource over the last several years to this project adjusted along the way with our best efforts to make the project work for all parties involved. We have been and continue to be a proud partner of the city of Yonkers and the State of New York. We remain committed to operating the property in its current format and believe it will continue to enjoy success serving customers in the Hawkers and surrounding communities.\nAlso, we have been consistent in our focus on premium best-in-class market-leading integrated resort operations and have held true to our message that we will optimize our portfolio when the right value opportunities are presented. This was the case for Northfield Park, which we are selling for $546 million in cash. You may recall, we acquired the operations in 2019 for $275 million. We have grown the business and create significant value over the last 6 years. And importantly, the sale multiple of 6.6x represents a significant premium to MGM's current share price which values the opco business at less than 3x.\nThis company's diversity is also a true benefit, and then all the headlines or concerns about Las Vegas and the general consumer MGM's consolidated net revenues grew this quarter, thanks to the geographic and channel diversity of our business.\nI've spoken in the past about the evolution of Las Vegas and that over the last 30 years, the market has grown at a CAGR of over 4%. Of course, that growth ebbs and flows over shorter measurements of time. And this summer, we heard from some of our guests around value in Las Vegas, and we responded by making adjustments to ensure a rationalized premium value experience across all of our properties.\nWe also partnered with the destination on a fabulous 5-day sale during which we sold over 300,000 room nights nearly double our typical pace, reflecting the strong demand that exists for our experiences. There are additional factors presuming the current visitation dynamic, including international visitation, particularly from Canada, Southern California drive traffic and the recent Spirit Airlines bankruptcy, resulting in several canceled routes. We are still expecting to receive over 40 million visitors to Las Vegas in 2025.\nWhile we don't expect the dynamic to be changed overnight, we are proactively working to create initiatives and draw incremental visitation. Despite these headwinds, several of our luxury properties generated record 3Q slot win. As we look to the fourth quarter, we see signs of stabilization as the luxury market segment continues exhibiting strength, Groups and conventions are returning and all MGM guest rooms will be upgraded and back online and F1 ticketing presales, particularly for the Bellagio Fountain Club are pacing higher versus the prior year. All of which puts us on a solid footing as we approach 2026.\nOver 90% of our target groups and conventions are contracted for next year, and the first quarter starts off strong with ConAg continuing into the year with other citywides. We also built off the 900,000 room nights we are facing the book through our Marriott partnership this year. And I'd note, October is shaping up to be the strongest room night month ever for forward bookings originating from the Marriott channel. We'll have a full year in 2026 to benefit from the group and convention initiatives launched in the second quarter this year that will allow us -- that will allow meeting planners and attendees to earn Marriott Bonvoy loyalty Perks.\nIn the meantime, we continue maintaining an oversized share -- room nights and rate relative to our Las Vegas competition. As visitation ramps up in Las Vegas, we fully expect our advantage will be maximized by the outside efforts of our employees who achieved our highest-ever 3Q gold plus NPS scores despite continued disruption from the MGM throughout the quarter, which, again, now has ended.\nOur teams in the regional markets drove another quarter of solid results. Several regional properties achieved record 3Q total revenue and EBITDAR and the regional operations as a whole generated all-time record slot win this quarter. The targeted capital to create and elevate VIP experiences at Borgata but a notable role again as a casino GGR growth outpaced the market during the quarter, and the Borgata posted all-time high table game shop and slot win.\nIn Macau, even a brief closure caused by typhoon wasn't enough to stop the positive momentum as MGM China achieved record 3Q EBITDAR. Our contributions are leading McCaul's evolution in the entertainment destination including the Macau 2049 residency Show at MGM Cotai and the Poly MGM museum at MGM Macau, all while staying focused on understanding our customers, particularly our focus on premium mass. The high end continues to drive market growth and quarter-to-date, we've seen a great response to the Alpha Gaming Club at MGM Macau, which officially opened in late September.\nSimilar to the elevated experience provided by MGM Cotai's Matching 1, MG< Macau's 3,500 square meter Alpha Gaming Club includes nearly 30 tables, dedicated restaurant cigar lounge and located just below the newly designed alpha bills. With more nongaming and entertainment events taking place in Macau, customers now have more reasons to visit and continue to drive growth into the market.\nThe later 2 drove accelerated revenue growth for this segment which in aggregate -- grew top line by 23% this quarter and saw a priority market collectivity growing in line with TAM or higher. Our European Bet MGM reached a new all-time revenue high in 3Q, we've improved profitability driven by customers' growth and market share gains.\nEven though the success has been offset by increased investment in Brazil, we are seeing quarter-over-quarter growth with healthy player fundamentals. Notably, growth has been driven around key metrics of retention, which is exceeding even some of our healthy mature markets. We have a great relationship with our local media partner, Grupo Globo, and are taking a disciplined investment approach for long-term brand positioning and profitability. We expect that to gain market share and reduce our gross spend in the future and MGM Digital has an opportunity for $1 billion in revenue with a significant margin, driving double-digit returns on those investments.\nProgress in Japan continues for 2030 opening, and we remain confident in our ability to generate a high-teens return at the time of opening, particularly as the only integrated resort in Japan, a country of over 120 million people. As of early this month, all elements of this project were under construction and at 1 time, there are 60 to 80 cranes and other pieces of heavy equipment on site. We also recently entered a USD 300 million equivalent yen-denominated credit facility at very attractive rates to support our funding commitment to MGM Osaka.\nAnd then Dubai also continues to make progress with an expected opening date in the second half of 2028.\nWith that, I will now hand it over to Jonathan to provide additional detail on our performance this quarter.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. And I'd like to echo my appreciation to all of our employees throughout our operations globally for their hard work and dedication. The effort does not go unnoticed and truly is the driver behind everything MGM achieves.\nThis quarter, the Las Vegas segment reported $601 million in EBITDAR and down $130 million year-over-year. The bridge to that shortfall includes 3 main parts: there was $27 million in decreased business interruption proceeds together with an increase in insurance expense due to increased reserves, $25 million in disruption from the MGM Grand Room renovation and $78 million from the impact on operations, primarily related to occupancy and ADRs.\nRoughly half of that operations impact can be attributed to Luxor and Excalibur and $6 million more can be attributed to lower hold year-over-year. The balance is attributed to softer ADRs and a decrease in occupancy, which affected volumes in food and beverage in some of our properties. This operating environment has provided an opportunity for us to focus on our cost containment efforts, and we've been able to reduce certain costs alongside top line fluctuations.\nNet revenue in Las Vegas declined 7% but we managed expenses down accordingly where possible, including FTEs that also decreased by 7%. As we look into the fourth quarter, we're seeing improving room rates. We also have the benefit of all MGM Grand rooms online and newly upgraded in time for the group and convention season. and we're seeing strong group demand in November and December, driving stabilization in our business.\nAs we look to next year, the 2026 group and convention channel has the ability to drive growth. Currently, future bookings are pacing up in all outer years, while attrition and cancellations are in line with historical averages. Regional operations had another steady quarter as we grew net revenues modestly. EBITDAR was down $4 million related to a decrease in business interruption proceeds of $6 million year-over-year. Beyond that impact, the results were very solid.\nMGM China continued its impressive run with record third quarter EBITDAR despite an estimated $12 million typhoon-related impact in September. We also ended the quarter with record market share of 15.5%. We continue to benefit from MGM China's strong cash flows with an $85 million dividend paid to MGM Resorts in September.\nAs we look to fourth quarter in Macau, we experienced year-over-year growth across segments during the Golden Week holiday period with visitation up 11% and total win up 20%. For the month of October, we're pacing to a 16.5% market share and well over $100 million in EBITDA.\nOur Bet MGM North American venture reported outstanding results and also announced that prior to the end of the calendar year, it will begin distributing cash back to MGM Resorts with the expectation of doing so on a quarterly basis going forward. We expect to receive at least $100 million in the fourth quarter from our $630 million total investment with more to come. The business model is proving out within just the last 12 months, we've witnessed the evolution from positive EBITDA inflection, then to solid growth trajectory, and now to a business generating ample cash capable of funding growth and cash distributions.\nMGM Digital reported revenue growth of 23% during the quarter, while segment EBITDA was a loss of $23 million. For the full year, we now expect MGM Digital to have EBITDA losses that could approach $100 million given our increased investment in Brazil. Though keep in mind, the actual contribution is consistent with our stake in the Brazil venture, which is roughly 50%. The venture has seen encouraging growth quarter-over-quarter throughout the year in active players, deposits and GGR. In our fourth quarter initiatives, including launching our in-house Sportsbook and continuing to increase the scale of the business, focusing on efficient returns.\nIn Japan, construction continues making practice. We've recently raised a yen denominated Term Loan A at the MGM Resorts level equivalent to USD 300 million at a borrowing cost of approximately 2.5% as of this month. This facility also has the ability to upsize to $450 million and we're already receiving incremental interest. We'll use the proceeds from this issuance to cover our equity contributions for MGM Osaka at least through next summer.\nFinally, we continue to see significant value in our share price. In this quarter, we were able to provide yet another transaction precedent to further evidence the attractive valuation, when you strip out the value of MGM China at market value and assign a consensus value to the BetMGM North America venture, which we still view as very conservative given the current trajectory, you end up with an implied multiple of under 3x trailing 12-month asset EBITDA to say nothing of the value of MGM Digital, a business that's capable of $1 billion in run rate top line with double-digit EBITDA margins and this compares to the 6.6x announced sale multiple for Northfield Park operations in Ohio, which, if applied across the board to our brick-and-mortar business, inclusive of Vegas, which arguably deserves a higher multiple in the regionals that would imply a share price of approximately $60.\nI'll open it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Fairly, I followed over a page, which I would like to spend a second on commenting about our digital business. before we take your questions.\nI know a few weeks ago, you all heard BetMGM's venture reported strong 3 quarter results and raised our full year guidance for the second time this year. increased 2025 EBITDA guidance to approximately $200 million represents an EBITDA increase of roughly $450 million in just 1 year without any new jurisdictions. Importantly, BetMGM will start returning capital MGM Resorts with an expected initial cash distribution of at least $100 million in the fourth quarter.\nI also want to follow up on BetMGM's recent comments about prediction markets. For decades, the gaming industry has been a highly regulated at the state level. This intense scrutiny has been essential to ensuring the integrity of the gaming industry and in the case of sports betting, helped to identify potentially irregular activity. This is not the time to back away from these high standards. Gaming historically has been and should continue to be a highly regulated industry with safeguards in place to protect consumers and promote integrity.\nI also want to take a moment and thank our Chief Operating Officer, Corey Sanders, who will be retiring at the end of the year, making this his last earnings call. I'm sure many of you on this call spoke to Corey frequently throughout his tenure. It's impossible to overstate what Corey has meant to this company over the last 30-plus years. As a person, as a leader, Corey understands the importance of caring for employees and treating people with respect. We all want to thank you, Cory, for your dedication, your service and your leadership and let you know that you will be deeply missed.\nIn closing, I want to stress that MGM is the only global operator across physical and digital channels, converging gaming and hospitality with entertainment and sports delivering diversified growth at scale. We have proven to be disciplined allocators of capital, and we'll look at any opportunities with attractive returns, including share buybacks.\nAnd in Las Vegas, it's worth repeating, we are focused on what we can control and are well positioned to adapt given the range and diversity of our luxury offerings. We stabilized -- we see stabilization in the fourth quarter and growth in 2026 and beyond. And over the long run, we see a measured supply outlook, a growing local population, expanding entertainment infrastructure rising demand for live entertainment and for luxury, and we remain very bullish on Las Vegas.\nAnd now operator, if we could open it up for questions. Thank you."

Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Mr. Gary Fritz, President of MGM Interactive; Kenneth Feng, Executive Director and President of MGM China Holdings; Mr. Hubert Wang, COO and President of MGM China Holdings and Howard Wang, Vice President and Investor Relations.\n[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded.

Welcome to the MGM Resorts International Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we have also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Howard. I want to start by focusing on the strength that often gets overlooked, which is the power of MGM's unmatched portfolio diversity. The benefits of having a global presence in both the brick-and-mortar and digital domains drove a record highest ever consolidated net revenue results this quarter.\nOur vision is to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company, pursuing that vision is paying significant dividends as we generate revenues in multiple streams across the globe. You're seeing the power of our portfolio diversity strategy on full display this quarter, we've accelerated digital growth, combined with record-setting results in China and in our regional properties more than offset a choppy period in Las Vegas.\nWe recognize that the substantial share buyback completed in recent years must be coupled with an active growth pipeline to fully unlock the company's value. In 2Q, our diversity is proving to be the bridge uniting the benefits of a lower share count and growth. We are positioned a kickoff of only significant value with notable near-term catalysts in BetMGM and Las Vegas and mid- to long-term catalysts in MGM Digital and our development projects, both domestic and international.\nOur BetMGM North America venture reported their second quarter results yesterday, raising full year 2025 guidance for a second time since the previous earnings call, which implies an EBITDA turnaround of nearly $400 million compared to last year.\nIn iGaming, there was a solid growth in average monthly actives and key engagement metrics such as active player days, while sports betting continues to focus on the areas that drove first quarter profitability, more targeted player acquisition, tighter management of lower-value players and retention of more valuable active players, all of which are benefiting from site components enhancements, including performance, discoverability and most importantly, speed.\nWith more efficient marketing spend, incremental revenue flow-through jumped to 66% year-to-date. This winning formula has given us greater conviction in our BetMGM North America's ventures ability to generate $500 million of annual reported EBITDA in the coming years. Our Las Vegas resorts are also poised to drive results higher in the near term, and I want to take this opportunity to emphasize that Las Vegas remains fundamentally solid.\nWe saw a record 2Q table games volume and record slot volumes at our ultra luxury properties. This quarter's adjusted EBITDAR decline was, in fact, isolated from 2 specific factors. One, the MGM Grand accounted for over 80% of the decline where results were impacted by uniquely disruptive room remodel and severely abnormal hold and midweek weakness at 2 of our value-oriented properties.\nOn the groups and convention side, our bookings are pacing up double digits, thanks to robust 2026 convention calendar that includes the return of [indiscernible] the Las Vegas Convention Center is spending $1.6 billion to renovate its legacy campus and expand the West Hall and remains on track to finish by the end of this year.\nWe will also benefit from greater Las Vegas convention attendance, particularly with our expansive luxury offerings. Las Vegas also recently celebrated the groundbreaking of the new $1.8 billion MLB stadium at the former site of Tropicana which is expected to bring 400,000 new visitors annually to Las Vegas. This puts the NFL, the NHL and MLB home venues, which also hosts a significant number of other sports and entertainment events all within 1 mile of each other.\nThe resulting golden triangle will surround -- be surrounded by MGM properties. And importantly, the Dome Stadium will bring meaningful game and entertainment inventory during the summer, mid-week periods, which will increase the value of our rooms during that period.\nOur exclusive Marriott relationship also continues to drive performance with a higher-quality customer. We remain on budget to book 900,000 room nights through the strategic channel and saw a 2Q room night increase 31% this quarter versus last year. Marriott customers consistently spend about $150 per room night more than all other customers.\nAnd year-to-date, the average over 20,000 room nights booked per year this -- we averaged over 20,000 nights booked this year per week. The pace has accelerated in July, and we had our best Marriott bookings week ever just 2 weeks ago.\nOur international presence brings us another near-term driver as we look to continue the momentum at MGM China, which absolutely shined in the second quarter with record adjusted EBITDAR and market share of 16.6% and representing the highest sequential gain amongst all concessionaires. What's even more impressive was that our share increased every month of the quarter, ending June at 1.3x our first share of the market. We now have all 28 [indiscernible] at MGM Macau available as of this month. And while MGM Cotai has begun converting standard rooms into 63 new suites by 1Q of '26, all of which will help us further uphold our complementary position of the properties and MGM account as a leading player in the Peninsula and Cotai as a preferred destination for premium mass players.\nWe are also benefiting from the continued momentum of our domestic regional operations their stability is highly valued during times of volatility, and we achieved our best second quarter results in both net revenue and slot win. 3 of our regional properties reported record high ever net revenues, and we saw strong performance across the gaming, hotel and food and beverage segments. Customers have responded positively to our focused capital improvements, and New Jersey is a great example.\nA few years ago, we upgraded the former Water club into what is now the MGM Tower Borgata which since May has been complemented by an elevated Asian gaming and overall VIP experience, including a new bar and restaurant. The new 25,000 square foot gaming space includes 51 tables, gaming salons and a high-limit area. The customer response to thoughtful targeted capital spending has been encouraging, driving double-digit GTR growth and outperforming the market by a wide margin since its debut.\nBeyond our numerous near-term catalysts, we have mid- and long-term drivers that are making meaningful progress with each passing quarter, 1 of which is MGM Digital. Our consolidated international digital business that does not include the BetMGM North American venture. The segment showed solid improvement, notably near breakeven performance when excluding our investment in Brazil. Our BetMGM Brazil venture partner, Grupo Global continues to provide us with beneficial flexibility in terms of marketing and investment, and our launch is making great strides as we are seeking all key measures seeing all key measures increasing, including strengthening player fundamentals and our bullish long-term view of the Brazilian market remains unchanged.\nAnd State side towards the end of the second quarter, we launched MGM's live studio from the gaming floor at the MGM Grant, content from our live dealer studio, which is currently available in 7 countries provided internally to our international operations and is also monetized to other online operators. Earlier this month, we launched our own sportsbook product in the second market made possible by our acquisition of Tipico's U.S. technology platform, as the integration into our in-house tech stack continues as planned.\nOn the development front in Japan, the first pilot was poured early this month. When MGM Osaka opens in 2030, we will be the sole license and operator, which is notable in a country where robust tourism and appetite for gaming and a population of over 120 million people. Considering these factors and how similar metrics drive other Asian destination gaming markets, we believe MGM Osaka has the potential to generate multibillions of dollars annually for MGM.\nProgress in Dubai has also started to gather steam with an expected opening date of the second half of 2028. And in New York, we submitted our application in June and are hopeful to be awarded 1 of the 3 gaming licenses that will be issued in December. Few companies can take on any of these projects on an individual basis, but our unmatched scope, scale and international experience allow us to manage all of these simultaneously while maintaining ample liquidity and a solid balance sheet.\nReporting record highest ever consolidated net revenues is not possible without the tremendous contribution from some of our -- all of our employees across all business segments, and it's worth highlighting that we have had another record gold NPS score in the second quarter despite the ongoing room remodel disruptions at the MGM Grant. As you can see, it's an incredibly exciting time here at resorts, and I will now hand this over to Jonathan to provide some additional color on our performance. Jonathan?\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Bill. I'd like to also express my appreciation to all of our employees for their hard work and commitment to excellence, whether on the front lines delivering exceptional service are behind the scenes, innovating new solutions, their collective contributions continue to raise the bar every quarter. We're very fortunate here at MGM to have a diverse portfolio of assets that constitute such a deep growth pipeline.\nThe BetMGM North America venture continued its momentum into the second quarter with revenue from operations up 36% and resulting in second quarter EBITDA of $86 million. iGaming grew 29% in the second quarter despite no new state launches driven by strong player acquisition at attractive payback economics and healthy engagement activity. Sports betting top line grew 56% in the quarter, benefiting from the repositioning toward the premium mass customer as well as targeted marketing and refined player segmentation efforts.\nOmnichannel efforts also continue to gain momentum. Our March Madness activations fueled a record number of Nevada first-time depositors while the single app, single wallet feature helped drive 30% growth in Nevada monthly actives. And as mentioned on yesterday's call from BetMGM 2025 guidance was raised to at least $2.7 billion of net revenue and at least $150 million of EBITDAR.\nI'm also happy to announce that BetMGM reporting will be aligned with MGM reporting beginning in the upcoming third quarter. thus no longer reporting 1 month in arrears going forward. We can queue the applause on the call. Here in Las Vegas, the market remains fundamentally sound. During the second quarter and now into July, performance on the weekends has been solid as we've been operating near capacity in our hotels across the spectrum.\nOur luxury offerings in Vegas maintained rate integrity with flat and table volume increasing about 4% and several properties reporting second quarter records for net revenue. The year-over-year adjusted EBITDAR decline in Las Vegas of $72 million was primarily confined to the MGM Grand and to a much lesser degree, midweek performance at the Luxor ex caliber.\nThe MGM Grand represented $60 million of the difference with the vast majority due to impacts from the room remodel and hold. When you exclude the impact of the MGM Grand property on our results, Las Vegas adjusted EBITDAR decreased about 2% in the second quarter. The lower midweek visitation in our more value-oriented properties has continued in July, but we're taking advantage of this dynamic by pulling forward the MGM Grand room remodel time line. Based on this accelerated time line, we now expect the remodel to be completed by the end of October, which will allow us to capitalize on these refreshed rooms in November in time for F1's return to Las Vegas and for the holiday season.\nWhen you also consider we've seen positive bookings in 3 of the last 4 weeks and solid bookings of groups and conventions that are in place for later in the year -- we're optimistic about restoring a growth trajectory in Las Vegas during the fourth quarter that will carry on into 2026.\nIn Macau, adjusted EBITDAR rose by 3%, resulting in a record quarter as visitation, player counts and premium player accounts rose at both properties. The focus on premium players is a simple strategy, but difficult to execute, yet our team continues to capitalize on all opportunities.\nIn July, we soft opened the Alpha Club at MGM Macau, an ultra-high-end offering that opened with 20 tables. We continue to fine-tune the offering and add amenities with an official opening schedule ahead of the October Golden Week. The regional properties had a particularly solid performance in the second quarter with record 2Q net revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDAR.\nMGM Digital, our consolidated international digital business that does not include the BetMGM North America venture, grew its top line by 14% and as the BetMGM brand extension has been driving improved results in existing markets, including the U.K., Netherlands and Sweden. Marketing and bonus optimization combined with OpEx management have been strong drivers of our cost management efforts. The brands we're investing in are beginning to achieve meaningful scale and Bet MGM brands are achieving all-time highs as they grow.\nOur full year 2025 adjusted EBITDAR expectations remain consistent with last year at MGM Digital. We're on track to achieve over $100 million -- $150 million in EBITDAR enhancements in 2025, the majority in Las Vegas with continued focus on automation and other initiatives in response to customer preferences. We've identified other opportunities to keep us on track as we champion a continuous improvement mindset across the business. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $217 million, all of which took place in April.\nThe pace of our repurchases has slowed as we focus our capital deployment on our development projects. Our share count is nearly 45% lower than it was when we began this buying program, and we've received Board approval for the ability to repurchase another $2 billion of shares.\nFinally, we continue to see meaningful value in the current share price. When you strip out the value of MGM China and market and assign a consensus value to the BetMGM North America venture, which we still view as a very conservative given the current trajectory. You end up with an implied multiple of 3.4x trailing month -- 12 months adjusted EBITDA to say nothing of the value of MGM Digital the business that's capable of $1 billion in run rate top line with double-digit EBITDA margins.\nSaid differently, there is an active accelerating growth pipeline that when paired with a nearly halved share count together will unlock meaningful value that's not reflected in our current valuation. I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Before we get to questions, operator, I'd like to take maybe a step back and refocus more holistically on what we're up to in the strategy. For us, it's to win the greatest share of the world's growing gaming market. MGM Resorts is the only global operator with the ability to converge gaming and hospitality with entertainment and sports, whether physical or digital and deliver accelerated diversified growth at scale, and we're uniquely positioned to develop synergies across all of those businesses. Our operational focus and calculate investments are paying off. Everywhere we operate, we're winning, particularly in premium and luxury.\nIn Macau, we have been to continue to be and earn more than our fair share, and that continues in the month of July. In digital, we've turned the corner on both the product and cash generation fronts with huge upside to capture. And in Las Vegas, with the [indiscernible] stadium, we seated in the middle of the golden triangle, ensuring MGM is uniquely advantaged by major events, especially sports.\nAnd internationally, we have the sole license in Japan with 120 million plus people with a proven propensity to game. The point is, we have the size and scale to see meaningful gaming opportunities anywhere in the world. And we looked at -- and as we look into the future, we remain very excited about that.\nObviously, there's been a great deal of talk and focus on Las Vegas. And again, I want to look and take a step back and think of this holistically. Over the last 30 years, the CAGR in Las Vegas and GGR has been close to 5%. We host many of the world's largest events and conventions in a city that is not readily if ever duplicatable.\nThis follow alone, we'll see Canelo/Crawford fight in Allegiant Stadium, 1 of the biggest flights Las Vegas has seen in the last 10 years. In September, Paul McCartney will be -- excuse me, in October and the F1 in November with presales, better than they've ever been, will be hosted here again in our community. Long-term college football championships come our way in January of '27 and the final 4 in 2028. Las Vegas is as solid as ever and MGM couldn't be better positioned to benefit by all of it. With that, operator, let's go to questions."

This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we have also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will be making forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Howard, and welcome to the team. We're very excited to have you join us. Let me start by thanking my colleagues at Interim results for delivering yet another exceptional year of record results. including our best ever for consolidated net revenues as well as an all-time high record annual domestic slot win, hotel revenue and F&B revenue. Our company is in a solid and enviable position today because of the culture of our employees that built around show and the culture of yes. Our commitment and dedication to guest centricity is reflected in our Net Promoter Scores which set an all-time record for Gold Plus customers in the fourth quarter and for the year. I can't say enough great things about our people here at MGM, who drive these great results day in and day out other than simply thank you.\nMGM is an industry leader, thanks to the strategic decisions we have executed on over the last few years. Our strategic plan has given us a strong financial foundation, a proficient operations and unparalleled growth opportunities in both digital and brick-and-mortar. And we're off to a great start in 2025. Obviously, the Super Bowl was just played Sunday, and from a casino perspective, was a strong event for us here in Las Vegas and at BetMGM. As we look into the rest of this quarter, and the remainder of the year, we are seeking positive indicators, with revenues up -- we are seeing positive indicators with revenues up in our domestic operations in January as well as ADRs on pay to continue to grow for most of the year. All of this momentum is backed by a solid balance sheet, characterized by low net debt and significant liquidity.\nOur globally recognized brands, prime locations, development opportunities and growing digital platform enable us to reach more customers and more markets than any other company in our sector with over 46 million MGM Board members and a total addressable market exceeding $150 billion, including both our physical resorts and online markets.\nI'm truly excited by the opportunities in front of us in 2025 and beyond, and here's why. Our leading position in Las Vegas will be a source of stability and growth in the near term. We are investing in our business and the customer experience. In 2024, we continued a broad improvement throughout Bellagio, the renovation of all of our suites new food and beverage offerings as well as a refresh premium gaming spaces. Additionally, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was transitioned to MGM Rewards and these regular capital investments into our resort operations drive continued guest visitation and increased spend.\nLas Vegas December -- slot handle and slot win with an all-time record level for any month in our history, and contributed to the all-time quarterly record for slot handle and slot win in the fourth quarter. We are bringing to fruition our goal of being the industry leader in groups and meetings with over 2.2 million room nights on the books for 2025. Last year, we completed a $100 million investment in Mandalay Bay Convention Center, and we welcome both new and existing convention customers to the space.\nDecember, we closed on the strongest convention booked month of the record -- of a record for a company. In fact, the bookings in December were 43% higher than our prior record month, a promising trend for our future. We concluded our first year with Marriott on 2024, which outperformed our original expectations with over 660,000 room nights stayed in the year and higher track bend in the leisure package rooms we look to displace. Importantly, we see further runway to grow in 2025 since all of our properties will be live for a full year of bookings.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we also rebended the Delano Tower at Mandalay Bay in [ W ] Las Vegas which has significantly and -- which has significant brand recognition and will now allow the resort to benefit from the Marriott distribution system and Marriott Bonvoy program. MGM's omnichannel advantage is now a much more meaningful opportunity with the extended improvement of the functionality and speed of the app and the launch of a single app -- single wallet in Nevada at BetMGM. During football season, BetMGM's significant presence throughout Las Vegas drove a 60% increase in the Nevada acquired first-time depositors versus prior season. We also saw a doubling in continued play of actives in their home state post their sign-up in Nevada, a signal that single-app single wall and is driving customer stickiness. These omnichannel players are 3x more valuable than the digital-only players.\nOur regional properties are truly best-in-class, and we expect them to remain a very steady source of free cash flow going forward. In Macau, we achieved the best ever full year segment adjusted EBITDAR in the history of MGM China. We continue to be a high-performing outlier in the market with exceptional execution by the team. Macau 2049, our first resident show at MGM Cotai and the Polyart Museum at MGM Macau, which sold over 10,000 people in 1 day during Chinese New Year's are both important steps to drive non-gaming revenues and visitation to Macau. We grew market share in December to over 16% and we concluded the year in its levels. We remain confident and believe we have proven that we have sustainable market share in the mid-teens, driven by our strong product innovation teams and the focus on the premium mass market.\nAt BetMGM, our business is stronger in virtually every aspect we compared to a year ago, and it drove over $2 billion in top line growth in net revenue from operations, accelerating from 6% in the first half of the year to 19% in the second half of the year. As we look to 2025, BetMGM expects the momentum to continue with net revenues from operating growing to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion and EBITDA inflecting positive, which represents an increase of approximately $250 million year-over-year.\nIn iGaming, we expanded content and player engagement tools and posted approximately $1.5 billion in revenue with over $400 million in contribution. We maintained a podium to -- iGaming market share at 22% of GGR and putting us firmly at #3 in times the size of the fourth-ranked operator. In All-in Sports, our product experience has improved driving progress and engagement and the activity KPIs and importantly, setting us up to be contribution positive in OSB for the first time in 2025. We expect to see continued benefit of our operating leverage as we grow revenue sustainably with a strong belief that BetMGM is on its way to achieving the $500 million annual EBITDA we've talked about in the future.\nIn international digital, we are inducing a new reporting segment MGM Digital, which is composed of our wholly owned consolidated online business. This segment consists of 3 major components: first, the core LeoVegas business, which is an established online gaming and sports betting operation in Europe, when excluding new brands, this business was solidly profitable in 2024. We've added features to this business such as content development, with the acquisition of [ Push ] and sports betting with the purchase of [ TIPICO's ] U.S. betting technology.\nSecond, expansion of the core business to the launch of the BetMGM brand throughout Europe; and third, Brazil, which is a significant market opportunity we are going after through our venture with -- Grupo Globo. We believe in the long-run investment of our owned and operated digital business, which collectively can achieve $1 billion in top line and healthy margins in a realistic medium-term target.\nIn terms of progress and strategy, we are completing progress of integrating TIPICO's U.S. sports betting technology through LeoVegas, and we anticipate going live with -- sports betting platform in our initial market as soon as next week with more launches to follow in Q2. We have already deployed the will power portion of the stack combined with our brand against favorable market opportunities in terms of scale, including the U.K. and Brazil and reinforced our market-leading position in Sweden through BetMGM [ Brazil ] -- we're also beginning to realize operating leverage against our more mature digital operations at LeoVegas and push. Now that much of the cost burden from the infrastructure building of these businesses is tapering.\nIn our development pipeline, progress in Osaka is advancing as planned. Ground preparation is targeted for the completion of this year, with main construction set to commence shortly thereafter. The official graduating ceremony scheduled for April 24, and additionally, the opening of the machine is subway in January marked a significant infrastructure milestone, enhancing transportation options for future guests to our resort. In New York, we plan to submit our RFA by the middle of the year, and we are actively engaged with the City of [ Acres ] on zoning.\nWith a strong year in 2024 and good momentum to start 2025, MGM is proving the targeted capital spending for reflection growth is critical to maintain our industry-leading position and our long-term expansion. We also recognize that to realize the full potential of MGM earnings power across the channels we operate in providing additional transparency to our investor community is important, so we are doing exactly that.\nI'll now pass this over to Jonathan to provide some additional details.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Bill. Before digging into the numbers, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few important new disclosure that we are introducing this quarter. The first is consolidated adjusted EBITDA, a common metric, which we think will provide a more familiar measure to compare our performance across others and other industries. The second relates to our digital businesses. We're now breaking out an MGM -- MGM Digital segment, which Bill touched on earlier, and we've expanded our disclosure of KPIs for BetMGM.\nWith that, I'll move on to our fourth quarter results. In Las Vegas, in the face of comping to a very strong quarter last year, revenues were down 6% and adjusted EBITDAR was down 11%. Including the variances related to F1 and hold, the underlying trends remain solid, evidenced by several data points, including an all-time quarterly record domestic slot win in the fourth quarter. We concluded the quarter and the year on a strong note with December occupancy and ADRs up single digits over 2023 and an all-time record for monthly domestic slot handle and slot win. [ Phantom ] gives us optimism that MGM's Las Vegas operations can grow in 2025, with the exception of the challenging comparisons this month of February, of course.\nMoving to the regional properties. We grew revenues by 7% and adjusted EBITDAR by 21% in the fourth quarter. MGM Grand Detroit drove a healthy -- of the year-over-year increase due to strong execution and the recovery from impacts of a labor strike in the previous year. But simply put, our strategy of operating best-in-class audits and high-value geographies is leading to outperformance across our regional portfolio. We achieved the KPI performances we work towards, growth in rated days, table drop and slot revenues while labor costs as a percentage of revenue were managed lower.\nIn Macau, MGM China grew quarterly net revenues 4% year-over-year, and total dividends from MGM China to MGM Resorts were approximately $200 million in the year. And last, but certainly not least, our new reportable segment, MGM Digital. Now this represents MGM's consolidated digital businesses. It does not include BetMGM, which remains an unconsolidated affiliate due to its 50-50 venture structure.\nNet revenues at MGM Digital grew 15% in the fourth quarter. While a lot of are narrowing in the U.K. from decreased marketing spend increased spending related to the launch in Brazil will result in MGM Digital's 2025 EBITDAR losses to stay relatively consistent with those we had in 2024.\nOn our last conference call, we discussed identifying approximately $200 million in operational EBITDA opportunities. We expect to capture approximately $150 million of these in calendar 2025. Roughly 35% of Visa's revenue actions and 65% is expense. And these initiatives will be deployed in a way that improves efficiency, leverages technology and is more responsive to changes in consumer behavior.\nBefore turning it back to Bill, it's really important to put our earnings power into perspective. In 2024, we generated approximately $2.4 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and that includes $461 million of noncash rent expense. When you add back that nice -- rent, it represents a more accurate view of our cash earnings power. We spent approximately $1.15 billion in CapEx during the year, both here in the U.S. and in China.\nAfter deducting our CapEx, this is the fundamental earnings generation that we deploy to high-return investments in the portfolio, unique development opportunities and returns of capital to shareholders. And speaking of returns, we've purchased over 40% of our float since the beginning of 2021 including 3.4 million shares in the fourth quarter last year and another 8.4 million shares thus far in 2025. Accelerating cash flow per share growth with this reduced share count. With the core brick-and-mortar operations delivering results, the growth potential of our digital businesses and future contributions from our development projects, we can create significant value for our shareholders.\nBill, over to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Before we turn this over to questions, I'd like to double down and take a moment on Jonathan's last comment on share buybacks. We continue to see long-term value in our share price and in the continued momentum of our business. At this moment, I see significant opportunity in the value of our shares. And if you consider the following simple assessment, you see the opportunity, hopefully, that I see.\nThe [ Visa ] Las Vegas will continue to grow as it has over the last 50 years, and no company is positioned to take advantage of that growth in MGM given our footprint and operational capabilities. And the stability in earnings of our regional properties, then simply take the market value of our Macau stock at face value, ignore the quantum leap we've made in sustainable market share performance and the expectation that our digital businesses are at a tipping point, with BetMGM's earning inflection positive in 2025, coupled with growth potential of MGM Digital and ascribe a marginal value to that segment of the business, you put it together in our business -- our poor business is trading at 4x 2024 adjusted EBITDA, well under its historic multiples. With this in mind, we will continue to be aggressive in our share buyback program as we think about near-term uses of our cash.\nWith that, operator, I'd like to open it up for some questions and answers."

Please note, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Andrew Chapman.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Jonathan Halkyard.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our quarterly results, I would like to congratulate and thank all of our employees for another great quarter across all of our businesses. Their high level of execution is clearly evident in results, and I couldn't be more proud of the team for our performance this quarter.\nTurning to our second quarter results. In Las Vegas, we achieved both top and bottom line growth year-over-year against a strong comparison. Net revenues grew 3%, driven by both higher rate and occupancy. Our strategic relationship with Marriott contributed to our performance this quarter now with over 410,000 rooms, room night book. The future for hotel bookings in Las Vegas is bright. Looking ahead at our pace, room rates on the books in Las Vegas are up for over a year for every month in the third quarter, and group rooms on the books are pacing up mid-single digits for the rest of 2024 and 2025.\nOur success in the quarter was underpinned by our luxury resorts, which are responsible for the vast majority of our top line growth in Las Vegas. We invest meaningfully in our strip luxury offerings as this is where we see the most opportunity for profitable growth. In fact, 75% of our 2024 domestic property capital budget will be focused on these properties. This includes room remodels, which are underway now at the MGM Grand and suite updates across our Las Vegas portfolio. On the technology side, we've now completed the integration of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas into our MGM Rewards program, which will now allow our MGM Rewards members to enjoy full benefits at the Cosmopolitan and vice versa.\nIn the regions, net revenues remained stable, driven by relatively flat year-over-year handle with our market share holding steady across each of our markets. We also have seen a full recovery at MGM Detroit, which we all know it faced headwinds since midway through last year. Margins were within our targeted range of the low 30s as we were vigilant on improving our variable labor effectiveness and executing on revenue initiatives, such as our expanded air charter program, just one of many examples.\nIn Macau, MGM China net revenues grew 37% year-over-year, achieving a market share of 16%. Adjusted property EBITDAR reached $294 million for the quarter, marking a 40% increase with margins at 29%. During the quarter strengthened MGM China's balance sheet by extending our maturity profile with the issuance of a new $500 million 7 and 8 notes due 2031. The proceeds of this offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nI'll conclude my remarks with some thoughts on the free cash flow algorithm we introduced last quarter. An algorithm that enables us to achieve a mid-teens free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate through 2028. Simply put, we expect to grow our EBITDAR at a faster pace than our rent escalators, interest payments, maintenance capital and taxes, while investing for growth and reducing our share count.\nFirst, we'll generate recurring free cash flow from our resort operations by optimizing the operating model to achieve incremental revenue growth and realize cost savings. We'll grow our market share in Las Vegas through reinvestment into our properties with a focus on luxury, we'll maintain our market-leading positions in the regional markets, including an expansion in New York and generating a growing dividend from MGM China.\nNext, we anticipate generating free cash flow from our digital businesses in the coming years as BetMGM reaches an inflection point and LeoVegas delivers on its numerous market entries. We'll also be investing for long-term growth in Japan and other markets where our development expertise and brand awareness provide a distinct advantage.\nFinally, we'll repurchase our own shares. Through our strategy of using excess cash for share repurchases, our share count has decreased to around 300 million shares from close to 500 million, an approximately 40% reduction in our float in just 3 years. Taken together, the increase in free cash flow and reduction in share count would result in a mid-teens free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate by 2028, even without a contribution from MGM Japan. Bill, over to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to start by doubling down on Jonathan's comments on congratulating all of our employees. Their continued attention to detail in guest service, has been amazing, and it continues to show through in our NPS scores and also just take a second to identify and thank our management teams into a challenging wage inflation environment. I think you've seen through our margins, they've all done a great job managing their way through the first part of 2024. And I will remind everybody that most of those increases now lapse as we go into the second half of this year.\nTurning to the quarter, we had excellent results against a strong '23 comparison. We see continued strength, as Jonathan mentioned, in Las Vegas, driven by transient group demand. The Marriott integration is going exceptionally well, and Mandalay Bay is fully leveraging on its updated space. MGM China continues to hold its market margins against a very competitive and evolving market. And our regions continue to hold top line creating efficiency and it's great seeing Detroit finally returned to its earlier prowess in that marketplace post-strike -- post cyber last year.\nIn Las Vegas, we believe Las Vegas growth continued its top line and maintain margins in the mid-30s. Group pace, as mentioned, is up in '24 and '25, anchored again by the refreshed space at Mandalay benefits from the Marriott program will only continue to increase, particularly on the group side, unique to MGM. We have a favorable supply dynamic with the closing of the Mirage in Tropicana taking approximately 1.5 million room nights off of the circuit. Again, we'll see lower years 2 through 5 labor contract increases. And organic same-store growth driven by further database optimization is just stepping in, particularly now with the integration of the Cosmopolitan, which we finally got on yesterday. So we're very excited by that.\nNoting in the third quarter, I think all of you know this, but remembering back, we had the cyber attack last year in the third quarter, and that should proved to be successful for us. However, in the fourth quarter, and I think many of you see this through our room rates, Formula One is showing some softness. We are hoping and believing that this rate will continue to pace up. But I think you can see that we're a little focused on trying to make that the best event that it can be, but that presents a potential headwind in the fourth quarter. Overall, though, given where we are to think about records into the second quarter of Las Vegas at this point is pretty compelling and pretty exciting for all of us.\nTo the regions, business remained stable with margins holding at $0.30 plus against an established and a consistent promotional environment, and we continue to have best-in-class properties with leading market share, providing a real steady free cash flow generation.\nMacau, the story continues. We're outstanding performance and the drivers of strength in that market, starting, I believe, with our leadership team. We have Kenny and Hubert on the phone. Pansy has clearly leaned in on many things that impact the property in our market. and ultimately, our market share. And so we're thankful for that. And there are many tactics that they deploy. I think the thing that's most compelling is the truly understand our customer, our customer base and their wants and needs. And without any real capital enhancements from where we left this market in 2019, we're obviously outperforming.\nMGM Macau is now the top producer on the Peninsula side, something in a position -- something we're proud of in a position we'd like to keep and so we're going to continue to invest into that property. And ultimately, overall, remembering the market has only returned to 80% recovery. Well, MGM is well above that. We still see opportunities not only for growth in the market, but ultimately for us to steal additional share.\nBefore I turn this over to Gary Fritz, who you've not yet, Matt, to talk more about MGM Interactive, I'd like to comment on Entain's recent announcements in BetMGM's domestic business. First, I'm excited by the relationship that we've created with Stella David as the interim CEO and now the Chair. I'm equally excited by the progress that's been made by the team and BetMGM's product enhancements with a key focus by the Entain Group.\nAnd now the recent addition of Gavin Isaacs as CEO is comforting, someone MGM and I have not known for a long time, have a great relationship and I think he'll do wonders for that business. And ultimately, the market.\nI'd also like to make a general comment on BetMGM's Monday release and some promising green shoots reported by competitors in the space. We have stated that 2024 would be an investment year, recognizing that we've lost shares in sports and that it was impacting our leading market position in iGaming, we righteously decided to invest heavy into our sports product and continue to invest in customer acquisitions for iGaming so long as we saw both market growth and overall market share growth.\nFor the record, BetMGM was also profitable in the second quarter of '24, driven by our iGaming business, which annually contributes about $400 million to the overall business.\nThe second piece is improving our sports product. We've made substantial steps with Angstrom, and we'll deploy a whole variety of new products into the football season. As well as single account, single wallet in Nevada, establishing customers to carry a wallet with funds back to their state. We think it's a big deal for the business and for our omnichannel efforts. And so we'll obviously invest into the fall with these new product offerings, trying to win back customers on sports.\nIn the big picture, we love what BetMGM has done for our brand. We love the long-term prospects, and we enjoy having a partner during this development stage that is equally focused on the business. We are patient and have a strong belief in the growth of this business now and long into the future.\nI want to turn it over to Gary. Gary is going to talk a little bit about BetMGM, but really focus on MGM's other interactive activities in the rest of the world. Gary?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Bill. Beginning a couple of years ago, we employed a journey with the vision of creating our own proprietary iGaming sports betting platforms. The goal is to develop a differentiated product capable of capturing market share in both established and emerging markets. The crux of this strategy is based on 4 pillars, and I'll walk through them.\nThe first pillar was for MGM to own its tech ecosystem so that we were not reliant on third parties. A tech ecosystem that is scalable and cloud-based. We achieved this in 2022 through our acquisition of LeoVegas. Not only did we buy the technology, but we acquired an exceptional management team with an aggressive strategic plan that we have been executing. We also recognize the importance of having an owned sports betting platform to further highlight our brands and generate more cross-sell opportunities. We took a large step forward to achieving technical independence with the purchase of Tipico's U.S. sports betting platform, which will close soon and drive important synergies.\nThe secular of our strategy was to own our proprietary iGaming content with unique intellectual property. We found this through our acquisition of Push Gaming in 2023. Our strategy with Push is to develop games that are not only exclusive to our owned and operated platforms, but also to create titles that can be marketed to other operators. Since our acquisition, MGM Resort branded games have been our highest performing titles in the Push ecosystem.\nThe third pillar of our strategy is to target organic growth in attractive regulated markets with the BetMGM brand. Just a reminder, we own the BetMGM brand and can use it anywhere in the world outside of the territories that the JV operates in. We do this using our LeoVegas proprietary tech stack. We have already launched the brand in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, with great early results, and we plan soon to enter Latin America.\nThe final component of our strategy is our live dealer product, enabled by our recently announced strategic relationship with Playtech, making us the only U.S. operator to offer live casino content for international markets directly from the Las Vegas strip. We have already launched at Bellagio and MGM Grand and are thrilled with the positive response, both from our live and online customers.\nThe next phase involves constructing a dedicated space at MGM Grand featuring table games and in the future game shows from well-known third-party brands. We believe the synergy among all of these pillars will yield significant long-term returns, starting with a double-digit stabilized return by 2027. In the near term, after 2 years of investment, we see the core businesses at LeoVegas and Push Gaming beginning to show positive momentum. Over the next few years, we will focus on expanding our sports platform and making further investments in our new owned and operated -- fully owned and operated BetMGM markets. Back to you, Bill.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Gary. And obviously, excited by all the progress, and we look to scaling this business, particularly the live dealer piece here in Nevada, I think, is interesting and unique to us. and exciting format.\nBefore I turn this open to Q&A, just a couple of overviews. Again, I think we enjoy a magnificent position in Las Vegas. We have made significant capital investment in our luxury. We've put over $1 billion into our properties in the last 3 years. Principally focused on the building we're in Bellagio. All of our rooms and suites now have been redone amongst many other new amenities.\nWe're also continuing to explore ways to further connect the heart of Las Vegas Strip meaning Bellagio, Aria and the Cosmopolitan together. Some of you may have seen over the last couple of weeks, a set of plans that was submitted to the county here. We are in the midst of trying to create something that we believe will be unique and special to Bellagio, something deserving, something that will have an experiential component, entertained component must see as well as retail and ultimately nightlife components that begin to marry itself up with some of the other things we have here that bring nightlife fab Bellagio in the long run. So we're excited by that. We'll have more of those plans for the next quarter to announce in terms of content and pricing. But we're excited by launching that product, hopefully, over the next several months here.\nAs I think about our regional properties, again, I want to reiterate stable and their free cash flow generating, and we're excited to have the properties that we do within our portfolio. Many of them, as you know, are market-leading. We have shown and demonstrated now, I think, in Macau, our growing EBITDAR prowess and our ability to have set a whole new plateau of economic performance. We are excited, and I am by the idea of omnichannel for the football this coming season for BetMGM. I think it finally unlocks our database and enables people to take their wallets and go home to places like Colorado and still have funds that they can share.\nI am equally excited by the overall digital strategy that Gary has laid out. I just recently returned from Japan and that it's moving along nicely. There in the ground as we speak, and we hope to start pilot launch by May or June of next year with a target state still middle of 2030 for opening. I think we are, as I think about expansion, I think about the UAE and New York, I think, in our project in Dubai of note, we're ideally situated and there has finally been some progress in New York, at least by the end of 2025. We all have to make our submissions and move that along. And I love our position in the Yonkers and what we've been able to accomplish with the local community there. I think, and I know we're in good standing as of this date. So I look forward to that.\nAnd ultimately look forward to additional markets. Next month, myself and Pansy Ho will be in Thailand looking at that opportunity. That is a venture that we're interested in. And if we do that, we'll do it through MGM China Holdings. And then finally, I'm excited by some of the news, or not news, but some of the information Jonathan consistently provides. I think we have an amazing balance sheet. We have low net debt. We have excess cash still able to deploy, whether it's into things here or against some of various propositions. And I think we ultimately have a pipeline of short-, middle- and long-term value creators.\nWith that, operator, I will turn this over to questions."

Joining the call for the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Kenneth Feng, Executive Director and President of MGM China Holdings, Hubert Wang, COO and President of MGM China Holdings; and Andrew Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Andrew Chapman.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these segments as a result of new information or otherwise.\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Jonathan Halkyard.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We've decided to change our approach to these calls in the new year to give you a more focused recap of our results with additional color and commentary around our plans for the future. With that in mind, I'll start the call with a discussion of the quarter and our growth algorithm and then pass it over to Bill for his comments.\nAs you saw from our press release, we delivered another record quarter across our company's consolidated businesses, generating record net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 13% from last year, net income of $217 million and adjusted EBITDAR of over $1.2 billion. During the quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $549 million and free cash flow was $377 million. This includes MGM China's $215 million in cash flow from operating activities and $15 million in capital expenditures.\nIn Las Vegas, we achieved 4% net revenue growth supported by strong ADRs, which were up 7% year-over-year. Our luxury resort offerings on the Strip served as a distinct competitive advantage, driving top line growth up 5% during the quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, rate is pacing ahead of prior year for each of the remaining three quarters and group rooms on the books are up year-over-year.\nIn the regions, it's no surprise that our businesses were broadly impacted by poor winter weather in January. That said, we experienced a quick recovery in February and acceleration into March. This also will be the last quarter where we need to adjust for same-store results as Goldstrike closed in February of last year.\nIn Macau, we lapped what was really the start of the recovery last year and achieved another record with net revenues up 71% year-over-year. MGM China earned its first ever $300 million quarter in adjusted property EBITDA, along with market share of 17% and surpassing the previous record set in the fourth quarter. Given the strength in MGM China's operating performance over the past 15 months, MGM China and MGM Resorts both agree there is no longer a need for MGM to support its liquidity. And in March, the subordinated loan agreement was terminated. Further, the revolving credit facility has been nearly paid down and dividend payments have been resumed with approximately $94 million to be paid to MGM Resorts in the second quarter, all very encouraging.\nAligned with our ongoing commitment to fortify our balance sheet and bolster liquidity, we recently completed the closing on the offering of $750 million of senior notes due 2032 at 6.5%. These proceeds were used to repay our [ 6.75% ] 2025 notes. [ Sarah Rogers ] and her team did an exceptional job, and the refinancing not only extends our liquidity profile but reduces our interest expense annually.\nFinally, in Japan, along with our partner, Orix, our venture closed on the JPY 530 billion project financing for MGM's Osaka Integrated Resort. This was the largest project financing ever in Japan and one of the most significant integrated resort financings globally. With this important milestone achieved, we'll continue to develop as soon to be iconic resort. We also bought back over $500 million of shares in the quarter, and as of yesterday, we've reduced our outstanding float to 313 million shares, 37% fewer than the start of 2021.\nI'll close with a summary of our financial growth algorithm. Our resort operations generate both significant and recurring cash flow. In 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion and free cash flow was $1.8 billion, of which MGM China accounted for $830 million of net cash from operating activities and $45 million of capital expenditures. This implies around $1 billion of free cash flow domestically. We expect to see benefit soon from our digital business with BetMGM beginning to generate significant free cash flow in the next couple of years and LeoVegas beginning to generate returns from its investment period. This free cash flow generation will fund future growth and opportunities where I expect minimum mid-teens returns. This includes international digital expansion as well as brick-and-mortar development.\nIn the longer term, we have an enviable pipeline of limited license development projects in New York, Japan and potentially the United Arab Emirates which will drive free cash flow growth over the next decade while also diversifying our geographic reach and earnings sources. Any excess cash generated beyond these projects within the constraints of our financial policy will be returned to shareholders through share buybacks. Collectively, we see this algorithm is driving the compound annual growth rate of free cash flow per outstanding share to be the mid-teens through 2028. And all while investing in the Japan Integrated Resort.\nBill, over to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan, and good afternoon and good evening, everybody. I am the color commentary that Jonathan spoke to in his opening comment. And what I want to do and what I hope to do in the future on these, just go through some top line thoughts as we think about the business and reiterate things that I think are important, obviously, in what happened in the quarter, but more importantly, from a go-forward perspective, Obviously, when we use the word record first quarter and if you look at and think about recent reporting, we're pretty excited and pretty pleased with that. It speaks to our diversity of our business and our four key pillars: Las Vegas, our regional properties, Macau, and we believe, ultimately, our digital business. We're obviously very excited and pleased by what's happened in China. Our EBITDA is up almost 80%, and it's 140% over 2019 levels. So it speaks to that market. I think what we've been able to accomplish.\nIn Las Vegas, our strength continues, particularly at the high end we make roughly 75% to 80% of our adjusted property EBITDA. The idea of a luxury campus and being focused on the epicenter of activity here has paid off, and we feel will continue to. And Marriott is off to a great start. We've booked approximately 75% over our expectations. And to date, we've booked over 140,000 room nights and the most surprising thing to date has been the group business. The activity case in that segment was a little unexpected. They do know a lot of folks that we didn't know, and we're quite pleased by that.\nAnd again, as I always start these, a kudos to our team, our Net Promoter Scores have never been higher. We're holding these scores on margins that have delivered. You saw the margin this past quarter at 37% for Las Vegas. And so we're very excited by that. And I want to thank the team who is doing more with less and doing it better than they've ever done it. So thank you.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, you've heard Jonathan talk about the credit facility. That's about $3.6 billion in Japan that represents the larger largest private financing in Japan's history. And we've also been able to hedge about 60% of that project against obviously has been a massively over inflated yen in our favor over the last couple of years. And so we're well into that positioning at 60% of that project hedged for the future. And obviously, we continue to leverage the balance sheet. You heard Jonathan say we've bought back 37% of the company, and we'll continue to do so where we see value.\nI think about Las Vegas first, again, another strong quarter, principally driven by the high end. Although we did see some signs of fatigue at the lower end of the market, overall ADR was up 7% in the first quarter and expected to hold that range into the second with increased occupancies looking at the second quarter and through the balance of the year. We're excited by the opening of connectivity between ourselves and Cosmopolitan. We finished the bridge that ties out [indiscernible] and Bellagio. And next quarter, I'll talk to you more extensively about plans to do a similar thing in the front of Bellagio that will tie out the front end of the strip to the Cosmopolitan and creating what we truly hope is a luxury campus.\nThe other thing that's obviously beginning to materialize. We saw the closure of the Tropicana and the [ Advent of the Age ] stadium is coming. And if you just take a moment and think about the positioning of us and all of these stadium/arenas between T-Mobile, Allegiant, and the new [ A ] stadium within a mile and really at the epicenter of our resorts, we have over 1 million seats a month that are accessible to some sport or entertainment activity and programming.\nWe have suggested in prior calls that our convention business was returning and it is and it has, most notably from tech our group forecast is up 6.5% for 2023, and our year-to-date production is up 29% for all future dates. And I will tell you that Mandalay Bay in April just had one of its most successful months in its history. And so we're excited and pleased by the team and the work that they've done down there. Despite all of this, we've continued to maintain the margins. And I want to remind something on the wage, obviously, the wage impact issue was almost 11% in Las Vegas or actually across the company, if I think about some of the individualized properties, but particularly across Las Vegas, come June 1, that begins to cycle. And overall, if you recall what we did, we did a 5.5-year deal with just over a 5% CAGR. And so those percentages now will begin starting in June, at least as an increase begin to fall.\nAnd then if you think about Las Vegas, maybe my final comment, Tropicana has closed. Obviously, the Mirage is pending and what may or may not happen there, but we don't see any new inventory for a considerable period of time. And obviously, we think that accretes favorably to us and ultimately, our current players.\nYou heard Jonathan's comments on the regions, and I think you've heard from many others, the quarter started slow, there was bad weather, particularly in the North and the Northeast, Detroit was particularly impacted by weather, [ by strike ] and still a hangover from the [ cyber ]. But each month has gotten progressively better. And in March, we returned with 47% market share. And so we're pleased by where that business is going directionally as well as the balance of our marginals and Corey promised all of us at 30% margin, and we hit it. And so given the wage increases, I'm pleased with that team and excited by that as well.\nMacau, as you all know, for us, in particular, but I think for the market is simply booming. We continue to maintain, I think, an outsized portion of share, we're at 17% for the quarter. Obviously, record EBITDA. We paid our first dividend since 2019. We heard this week about Visa reforms. And I think some of the regions are opening up without needing visas at all. And so I think that accretes all to visitation and obviously, in all of our favors. And if we recall, the market's probably back at about an 80% rate. So we still see some uptick and some growth there. For us, in particular, we're excited by some of the enhancements. And we're adding new villas at MGM Macau and Suites in [ Cotai ] because we are under suited in that market.\nWe have a new show that was announced, [ Johnny Mo ], the producer the 2008 Beijing Olympics is producing a show for us, which we're very excited about. And we have a world-class museum currently under construction at MGM Macau which will begin to satisfy and speak to some of the cultural things that we promised the city in Macau in general that we do. And so overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the team and the job. And I will make this comment, margins there, you'll see our 29% for the quarter. So despite the hyperbole about all of the promotional activity, particularly aimed at us at 29%, I just query that, and I challenge that and frankly, if we had retail to the extent of someone like two of our competitors, we'd be in the low to mid-30s. And so I'm excited about what the team continues to do there. And obviously, we expect and see. And as we've seen again in April, that to continue.\nMoving over digitally. There are some challenges, obviously, in North America. We are focused with BetMGM on our product and Angstrom integration and we're working hard at that. We've launched single account, single wallet everywhere but in Nevada. And you will see that come to fruition between now and football season. And Angstrom has now begun to give us additional parlay offerings and in-play betting baseball and NBA, and we hope to bring that to fruition again with football this fall. So a lot of work to do there. We recognize the product efficiency, but I like the road map. I like the team. I like the focus, and I like where we're going.\nOutside of the U.S., LeoVegas, particularly now in Sweden, has seen a return. There was a whole relicensing procedure there that cost everyone, including us, and that was their primary market. So LeoVegas is on the rebound. BetMGM U.K., which we spoke about last quarter is doing exceptionally well. We've established a real presence there. And again, something we're excited by. And then yesterday saw the first soft launch of BetMGM in the Netherlands. And so the BetMGM brand will begin to extend itself throughout LeoVegas' network and beyond. Overall, our digital strategy remains the same. At some point, we want to be self-sustaining with all site features, including producing our own games and our own product. Some of the initial work by [ push ], we've mentioned before, is doing exceptionally well, and we're excited by that. You'll see live dealer up and operating between now and the end of summer here in Las Vegas. Very excited to understand that and the value that, that could ultimately bring our digital business. And the idea that we could do live dealing from Las Vegas and put it out into several global markets, I think it's going to be interesting and fascinating for the business and a good brand builder of note. And we are also looking at to LeoVegas business, LATAM and South America and some additional Eastern Europe countries for exposure and for expansion.\nOn the development pipeline, we've talked about this, but now that we have financing in place. We put our consortium in place, excited to be going forward with real construction and we hope to be in the ground sometime next spring, summer, driving pylons with a -- we still have an eye on a 2030 opening and nothing is to dissuade that at this point. So we're excited by it. We're excited by the design, the development and the fact that we've got this next most important phase behind us, and so we're pushing forward aggressively.\nYou heard Jonathan talked about we had UAE. We have an eye on Abu Dhabi in Dubai as that unfolds. And so to the extent something becomes meaningful, obviously, we'll keep you all posted. I will say we're somewhat disappointed with the process in New York but we've been there since, I think, 2015 or '16. We will remain patient and we will remain focused. And the good news here for us is we like our chances, the City of [ Yonkers ] has our full support behind us. And so we think that's meaningful as we come ultimately into the process that will entail. It sounds like next spring, if you will.\nAnd then like many others, we have an eye in Texas and Thailand. Time to tell what happens both in those two markets. Obviously, it's a government process that's ongoing in both places. But we are there, and we are just trying to understand those opportunities for what they may ultimately bring to the company.\nIn conclusion, you've heard me use this word in the past. And I think probably more than any other quarter, it came through in this quarter, there were diversification of our products and the diversification of our business Obviously, Macau did a great deal of lift this quarter. Las Vegas held its own, the regionals are recovering, and the digital business has been fully funded, and we're looking forward to what it can do ultimately down the road. So with all of that, I will turn this open to questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note, this conference is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Chapman.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to MGM Resorts International Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com. We've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.\nActual results may differ materially bust contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. It is required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or otherwise. During the call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. MGM Resorts achieved outstanding results in 2023, delivering all-time high adjusted property EBITDAR in Las Vegas and in MGM China. Notably, 7 of our domestic properties set individual records for adjusted property EBITDAR for the full year. These outstanding accomplishments underscore the resilience and the agility of our team in navigating a complex operating year.\nIn fact, our employee record NPS scores from our customers throughout 2023. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees who constantly strive to deliver on world-class service to our guests. The strength and resiliency of Las Vegas market has been particularly impressive. Strategically, you've heard me talk a lot last year about the evolution of Las Vegas as the new sports and entertainment capital of the world. You saw that fact proven out again Sunday as the city proudly hosted Super Bowl 58 right in our own backyard.\nThe game was another strong hotel and casino event for us with ADRs near thousand and posting 3 of the top 5 room revenue days ever recorded and near-record event gaming volumes. The game weekend is typically a strong event for MGM Resorts, but having the game in town amplified those results dramatically. The game on Sunday followed our inaugural [ F1 ] race in November, which was also an incredible success as the largest city event in our history. Additionally, we glean valuable insights from the event and specifically on how to better price and program all of our resorts and streamline the preparation work for future years.\nBoth F1 and Super Bowl, our brand was on full display. Our proximity to Legion Stadium, the F1 track, and of course, T-Mobile Arena afford us the opportunity to expand our reach during these citywide events. We also have officially launched our partnership with Marriott with impressive early results. Marriott Bonvoy customers can now seamlessly book room to select MGM properties in Las Vegas with 16 brands to be introduced by the end of Q1. In Macau, we ended 2023 with an all-time record adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter and the full year. Our robust market share was comfortably in the mid-teens and continued its upward trend in January.\nThe strategic addition of 200 table games, coupled with the agile operations of our team and the reinvestment into many amenities have collectively driven these exceptional results. In digital, BetMGM made at full year 2023 targets in both net revenue and second half profitability. They also made significant strides in the technology road map [Audio Gap] with the launching of a new app design and with single account, single wallet capabilities being available now in those states.\nLooking ahead, our outlook remains strong. We're encouraged by the metrics we've seen in our business including room and rates on the books and in the year group attendance and future bookings as well as the robust event calendar for the [ city ]. Our Las Vegas operations would represent more than 70% of our U.S. brick-and-mortar adjusted property EBITDA in 2023 will benefit from a number of key initiatives in '24. For example, our transient segment will grow as a result of the Marriott relationship, which will bring a new customer base that will be acquired at lower acquisition costs, higher rates and more spend on property.\nOn the group side, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center refreshes nearly complete, and we're poised to benefit from an increased 100,000-plus group room nights on the Strip. With MGM's casino segment, we will drive growth from the return of Far East [indiscernible] Play, which is still below 2019 levels. We will leverage our branch office network to drive customers to our resorts in Las Vegas and expect to see further recovery of international inbound flights, which are still only 75% recovered from Asia.\nLater this week, we will hold our annual Chinese New Year celebration at Bellagio and Aria, which is already seeing strong gaming demand, stronger gaming demand excuse than last year. Our 2024 regional outlook anticipates demand to remain stable. That being said, we are committed to consistently improving our operational model, sustained margins and foster a steady generation of free cash flow. Our regional portfolio has historically proven to be highly defensive, thanks to the exceptional high-quality assets we operate the diverse set of nongaming amenities we offer, our strong market share positioning and overall customer loyalty. Looking ahead in Macau, our exceptional results for 2023 have carried into the first 45 days of 2024, driven by successful events, including a Bruno Mars concert at the driving strong visitation to our properties.\nDemand in our properties for Chinese New Year, which is also going on now is also very strong. As we look further into the year, the Macau government has set a target to attract 33 million visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17% increase year-over-year, a testament to our team's continuous innovation and crafting compelling experiences for our predominantly premium mass clientele. Our focus is on the New Year [indiscernible] remain on 3 priorities: implementing strategic adjustments to our casino floor and existing room offerings to optimize yield, prioritizing the needs of our mass and premium mass customers and actively driving international tourism.\nTurning to BetMGM in 2024. We will soon be live in 29 markets with the launch of North Carolina next month. We had a noteworthy technology achievement in January with the approval and subsequent migration of the Entain platform in Nevada. This sets the stage for integration of single account, single wallet in Nevada later this spring, which is critical to our omnichannel thesis with fully unlocked -- and will fully unlock one of the key differentiators for BetMGM by fully leveraging our Las Vegas properties. Within our international digital space, in the U.K., LeoVegas, BetMGM's KPIs have exceeded our initial projections, demonstrating again the strength of MGM's brand.\nIn fact, by leveraging the MGM Resorts balance sheet, we now offer the highest jackpot payouts amongst all competitors in the U.S. that are offers even that much more compelling. Turning to our development pipeline. In Osaka, we successfully began liquefaction countermeasures in the fourth quarter, maintaining our trajectory to commence preparatory construction efforts in 2025 on time for 2030 opening. Additionally, in New York, the request for proposal process is currently underway. We anticipate submitting our full application to the government by the middle of this year with a decision expected shortly thereafter.\nPutting it all together, our company is in a great position to generate free cash flow through 2028. We'll deploy this free cash strategically into development projects such as Japan and New York, we'll reinvest in our existing portfolio through maintenance and growth CapEx, which we are specifically focused on enhancing and expanding our luxury-oriented offerings and the repurchase of shares at attractive levels and investment which we believe will still continue to generate strong returns. Jonathan, over to you.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. And before I dig into the financial results, I'd like to join Bill and thanking our employees at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly great year. While I certainly focus on our exceptional financial results, we accomplished that so much more together. Our consolidated businesses in the fourth quarter generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 22% from last year, net income of $202 million and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $716 million and free cash flow was $387 million. It's important to note that $283 million in cash flow from operating activities and $18 million in capital expenditures related to MGM China and they were included in the quarter.\nFor the full year of 2023, free cash flow was $1.8 billion. In Las Vegas, same-store net revenues, which excludes Mirage from the prior year period was $2.4 billion, up 10% over last year. On previous calls, we've talked about the fact that our operations in Las Vegas skewed towards the high end with approximately 80% of our strip adjusted property EBITDA coming from our luxury properties. Interestingly, this year's revenues from our luxury properties increased mid-teens for the quarter and the year, representing approximately 90% of our absolute top line growth. And this further highlights the prominence of the higher-end segments in our business here in Las Vegas.\nSame-store adjusted property EBITDAR increased 3% or $29 million year-over-year margins were about 36% in the quarter, well within our expected range in the mid-30s. In the regions, same-store revenue, which excludes Gold Strike, was down 7% year-over-year with same-store adjusted property EBITDAR decreasing $64 million or 22%. It's important to note that approximately $60 million of the decrease year-over-year came from Detroit and National Harbor, where those properties were impacted by disruptions related to a strike and some high-end play not returning, respectively.\nThere was also some lingering cyber incident challenges that specifically impacted the regional portfolio given that promotional offers were not available to our customers for the first half of October. Beyond these specific property circumstances in the fourth quarter, the regional property trends remained stable. As we look to drive future growth within our domestic portfolio, our centers of excellence and property leaders have identified opportunities to increase our share of customer spend and drive organic growth. We see plenty of both near-term and medium-term opportunities to enhance revenue per occupied room night even beyond the benefits of the Marriott partnership.\nFor example, adaptive pricing will maximize throughput within our high demand outlets and will further enhance our ability to drive upsells and new product offerings. This includes bundled packages with room, show and food and beverage offerings. We expect these initiatives to drive [ rev ] growth in 2024. Improved segmentation will allow us to increase personalization and enhance the guest experience while driving increased NPS and overall customer lifetime value. An omnichannel purchase behavior by our MGM Rewards members will be enhanced by a single account, single well in Nevada later this year.\nOnce in action, our customers will be able to open an account here in Las Vegas and bring that wallet home to continue their experience with MGM Resorts, allowing us to drive targeted marketing and outreach to further cross-sell our digital and physical assets. Moving over to MGM China. Our record adjusted property EBITDAR of $262 million was a 42% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was driven by casino revenue, which increased 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and more specifically our main floor segment table games win, which increased 74% from 2019.\nMargins were in line with the first 3 quarters of the year at 27%. Market share was an all-time record in the fourth quarter at over 16%. And for the full year, our market share exceeded 15%, which is 600 basis points above our 2019 performance and 300 basis points above our table fair share. On the digital side, BetMGM successfully met its 2023 targets by reporting positive EBITDA in the second half of the year and reaching the upper limit of its net revenue from operations guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And let me close with, as usual, with a brief walk-through of our capital allocation strategy and our valuation. First off, we successfully closed on an amendment and extension of our seam-secured credit facility this week.\nThis expands our capacity by approximately $600 million to $2.3 billion and extends the maturity of that facility to 2029. The commitment from our relationship banks allows us to sustain our financial policy of a minimum $3 billion in liquidity while deploying incremental cash for further high-return investments, including share repurchases. As Bill mentioned, we expect to fully fund the equity contribution in Japan and the commercial gaming expansion in New York with our free cash flow.\nDomestically, we intend to invest maintenance capital of approximately $600 million this year or 4% of revenue, which is consistent with our historical trend. Major maintenance capital projects this year focus on luxury-oriented offerings. Examples being the remodeling of the Bellagio Tower Suites, the Cosmopolitan Chelsea Tower penthouses and the MGM Grand Main tower rooms. As of the end of 2023, we had liquidity of $4.5 billion when excluding MGM China. Excluding the cash that we keep on hand to operate our business in keeping with our policy, we have $1 billion in excess cash, which will be allocated to international and digital acquisitions, high ROI capital projects, and share repurchases. We continue to see great value in our shares. And during the year, with a $2.3 billion repurchase of our shares, we reduced our share count by 14%.\nTo close, I would briefly like to discuss our enterprise valuation and why we still believe share repurchases are remunerative use of our capital. Consider the following. As of yesterday, our share price was $47, and we had 320 million shares outstanding. This equates to a market capitalization of $15.1 billion. And if we add our quarter end domestic net debt, and subtract the market value of our 56% stake in MGM China and analyst consensus estimates for the value of our 50% of BetMGM, then we have the enterprise value of our operations less China and BetMGM of $10.6 billion. Divide this by our 2023 EBITDA adjusted for corporate expense, and we calculate an implied current trailing trading multiple of just 4.9x. We think this multiple represents a discount to the value that we see in our future cash flows, which provides us further conviction in returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing our shares at these levels. Bill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Before I open it up for questions, maybe just some general comments on the year. And you've heard me say this in uses were resilient and luxury a couple of times. If you think about particularly this last quarter, we were on our heels with the cyberattack. You all understood what that did to us.\nAnd so as we entered October, to think we'd end up having the quarter we had. I just -- I couldn't be proud of the organization. And it particularly shown through in luxury. Bellagio, after 25 years, had its best quarter in its history and its best year in its history, and so it does prove that we continue to invest in these properties in the right place at the right time does make a difference. And so we're very excited by thinking about that as we continue to go forward. I think about what happened with BetMGM and ultimately, our database.\nMGM Rewards database now is over 44 million participants driven by BetMGM and ultimately, the omnichannel effect of that long term we think to pay dividends. Macau is doing amazingly well. I know some of our competitors are wondering what we're doing. Kenny and the team broke through 20% in the month of January for market share. I'm not suggesting that's sustainable. But I will tell you, I think we have repositioned those 2 properties, and we're prepared to compete on an equal basis with anybody in the marketplace. When I think about BetMGM, the original goal 5 years ago was to get into the top 3 because we thought it mattered, and we have.\nWe realize there's focus on product. There are some things we need to do to maintain and keep market share. And we think moves by that team with Angstrom and other things have done that for us. We realized, particularly this quarter, there's pressure on regional margins. We know what they did. But remember, what Jonathan said, $60 million of the $64 million was tied to 2 events. The Detroit strike and ultimately, a player in our National Harbor company didn't come back year-over-year. We find ourselves in one of the best balance sheets in the industry, which well positions us to invest in places like Japan and New York. We are looking aggressively at the UAE and Gary [ Fritz ] and the digital team has constant things in front of us in terms of growing the balance of our worldwide digital business. And so we're excited by all of that. And then obviously, if again, you follow Jonathan's map, like every CEO, we think we're under traded at 4.9x, but obviously, you all will be the judge of that. So with that, operator, I will open it up for questions."

Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Hubert Wang, President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM China; and Andrew Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Chapman. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, we've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our par filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or otherwise.\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation of GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. In the third quarter, we had a fantastic results as evidenced by our record consolidated net revenues. And despite the disruption across our portfolio, we achieved record same-store ADRs in Las Vegas as well as a record third quarter regional net revenues on a same-store basis. To say the least, we're off to a strong start prior to the cybersecurity issue. And to briefly summarize, on September 12, we disclosed that we identified a cybersecurity issue affecting certain of our U.S. systems. As a precautionary measure, we proactively shut down certain systems to mitigate risk to customer information, which resulted in disruption at some of our properties. .\nOver the following weeks, we systematically restored to enhance these systems, and we're fully operational by the end of the month of September. Following the issues, we have seen incredible resiliency in our business to start the fourth quarter. Going forward, we do not anticipate any further operational disruptions from the incent as expected that insurance will cover the losses incurred. We expect to receive insurance reimbursements in the upcoming quarters and Jonathan will provide more detailed information on the quarterly financial impacts in his remarks.\nI want to express my deep appreciation once again to our employees for the response during a challenging few weeks. They showed resilience and professionalism but more importantly, a commitment to our culture of taking care of our guests and each other. We've been humbled by the feedback from many of our guests who took the time to call out the exceptional service they received. We're coming out of this stronger as a team and as a culture with a focus on the culture of yes from both our guests and employees. One last thing on the employees. We continue to negotiate in good faith with the unions in both Las Vegas and Detroit with the goal of reaching agreement on new record contracts that work for everyone.\nIn Las Vegas, as you know, Caesars Entertainment came to a new tenant of collective bargain agreement this morning, and we are literally in session as we speak, and I believe we will come to a deal today. We know from listening to our employees that they are looking for a pay increase, the combat inflation, as well as reduced workloads among other concerns. This deal when announced, we'll do just that and will result in the largest pay increase in the history of our negotiations with the culinary union.\nAs we shift our remarks to the fourth quarter, we anticipate the rival Las Vegas inaugural Formula 1 race next week. We are well prepared to welcome our guests for that what promises to be an exciting and enduring tentpole event. We sold out our Bellagio Fontan Club and grandstand seats. Cash roommates are several multiples have had of the same week in prior years, and the casino front money deposits indicate Formula One will be an all-time record casino event. As we look into 2024, we see strength in future bookings rate and group pace into the first half of the year, and we're encouraged by a number of tailwinds, including the launch of Marriott's direct bookings in the first quarter, a fully renovated Mandalay Bay Convention Center, which will return 100,000 primary midweek room nights lost in 2023, International Bacara play further coming back opportunities to enhance our omnichannel marketing offerings to bet MGM and MGM Rewards customers, improving cross-play between regionals and Las Vegas, exceptional high Super Bowl demand as well as a strong event calendar for the balance of the year, including the return of Formula 1 in the fall of '24. And plus the recent completion of the bridge connecting the Cosmopolitan City Center and Bellagio. We've been diligently also working on deploying capital in meaningful ways of our existing resorts with numerous hotel restaurant and entertainment refreshes.\nBeyond these domestic operating tailwinds we are underway in Japan, we believe we are well positioned to be awarded a commercial gaming license in New York, and BetMGM is now on a positive path of more of those in just a moment. Turning to our regional operations. Top line trends were solid. In fact, as mentioned previously, we had a record third quarter same-store regional net revenues despite the disruption. Margins were expected in the low 30s. In the Macau market, it is clearly evident that business is booming. In fact, it was a third quarter net revenue adjusted property EBITDA record and surpassed 2019 and adjusted property EBITDAR mass GGR and visitation. Then to kick off the fourth quarter, we had an amazing Golden Week that led to a market share for October of over 15% and an all-time record adjusted property EBITDAR for the month.\nResults have been outstanding because of the ingenuity and execution of the team at the MGM China. Looking forward, we are still laser-focused on 3 key priorities: making opportunistic changes to our casino floor and existing room products to maximize yield, taking care of our mass and premium mass customers and driving international tourism. At MGM Cotai, we will start remodeling of our platinum area for completion early next year. And at the MGM Macau, we have begun planning for a villa upgrade and the addition of 6 new villas. BetMGM in the U.S. is now live in 28 markets. The team is making great progress with the integration of Angstrom in our sports products adding a merriment of betting options not offered before and single account, single wallet has launched in all the states, but Nevada. The BetMGM team will provide a comprehensive business update next month on their progress.\nSpecific to our international digital efforts and September MGM Resorts and LeoVegas, launched a multimedia marketing supporting the BetMGM brand in the U.K. with Chris Rock leading the campaign. U.K. market is ideal for an initial launch due to its size and the brand recognition of MGM with U.K. customers. Initial KPIs are very encouraging with the first time deposits much higher than expected. We will leverage our recent acquisition of Push gaming to bring innovative games to the U.K. and ultimately to BetMGM. We will also look for push to extend into further international markets through existing B2B relationships.\nOn the development front, we signed our implementation agreement with the City of Osaka in September, and this is effectively our green light to begin the project. The total project cost of JPY 1.27 trillion of which MGM's expected equity contributions of approximately JPY 300 billion, which at current spot is roughly $2 billion, costs have inflated through the course of the progress -- process we have kept the budget unchanged by reducing minor scope around certain areas that will not impact the project returns and by locking in very attractive foreign exchange rates.\nWe look forward to breaking ground Osaka for it will be Japan's first ever integrated resort. In New York, we have submitted our second round RFA questions to the Gaming Commission and we're prepared to submit our application within 30 days of the date at which the Gaming Commission answers those questions. We believe our existing facility, brand recognition and strong ties for the anchors community, making us a great contender for 1 of those 3 available licenses.\nIn Dubai, our partner Wassil, is under construction on a luxury development, including 1,400 hotel rooms with the MGM Grand, Bellagio and Aria brands. We currently have a hospitality management deal requiring no capital from us. That said, we do significantly -- we do see a significant opportunity if gaming were to be legalized, first in UAE and ultimately in Dubai. We believe they have the best gaming hospitality brands in the world with the best location in Dubai and our existing project could include a world-class gaming component, if approved. And finally, we expect the launch of our strategic relationship with Marriott to begin in early 2024 when we will begin to start taking reservations.\nWe have launched the official landing page, and we'll soon announce the exciting loyalty benefits we plan to offer to both MGM Rewards and Marriott Bonvoy members and its 180 million numbers.\nIn closing, the stability of our domestic business and the focus on margins will be supplemented by BetMGM is approaching profitability as well as by outsized earnings opportunities in Macau as the business continues to ramp further. We also have long-term drivers with our developments in Japan and New York and our international digital strategy with LeoVegas. When you connect each of these prospects for cash flow generation together, add to it a fortress balance sheet with more cash than debt when excluding MGM China and then considering the fact that we have reduced our current share count by approximately 31% in less than 3 years, and our Board recently approved an additional $2 billion share buyback authorization we are confident that the company is tremendously positioned to grow its free cash flow going forward.\nWith that, and before I lose my voice completely, I will turn this over to Jonathan for more details on the quarter.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. Before I get into the financial results, I, too, would like to commend the selfless efforts of all of our employees during our recent cyber security issue. I personally witnessed so many people on our teams go above and beyond to support their colleagues and take care of our customers. As you likely saw in the 8-K, we highlighted an estimated adjusted property EBITDAR impact from the cybersecurity event of approximately $100 million in September. .\nMost of this impact was from a loss in revenue from room cancellations in Las Vegas and our service recovery efforts. We expect the Q4 impact to be limited. With some hotel bookings lost in the first part of October and a brief disruption to the direct mail cadence in our calendar, which affects the regionals more meaningfully than Las Vegas. We remain confident that the losses will be covered by our cyber insurance.\nNow turning to the results for the quarter. Our consolidated businesses generated net revenues of $4 billion, up 16% from last year. Net income of $161 million and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.1 billion with significant contribution from MGM China. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $694 million and free cash flow was $484 million, it's important to note that $197 million in cash flow from operating activities and $8 million in capital expenditures related to MGM China and were included in the quarter.\nIn Las Vegas, net revenues of $2.1 billion were down $195 million or 8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted property EBITDAR was down 16% to $714 million. Same-store net revenues, which excludes Mirage from last year were down 2% and same-store adjusted property EBITDAR was down 11%. And Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDAR margins were 34%, and we estimate about 200 basis points of margin impact in Las Vegas was related to the cybersecurity issue.\nAt the start of the third quarter, trends were solid in Las Vegas. July and August combined net revenues on a same-store basis were essentially flat versus 2022. Occupancy for the first 2 months was up 100 basis points year-over-year and then fell to 88% in September, down 6 percentage points year-over-year. That being said, we drove a sharp recovery in October with occupancy back up to 95% in Las Vegas.\nImportantly, while we're still working to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary union, we have been accruing for an increase since June 1. We will not provide the full details of that accrual at this time given that we're still in active negotiations, and we'll look to technology and process improvements to help offset the incremental labor costs we expect.\nTurning to the regions. In September, the cybersecurity event also affected the regional properties. Prior to this incident, July and August had a strong start to the third quarter with a 2% increase in same-store net revenues versus last year. Full third quarter revenues of $925 million though were down 5% compared to the prior year, and adjusted property EBITDAR was down 9% to $293 million. Same-store revenues, which exclude Goldstrike were up 1% and same-store adjusted property EBITDAR was down just 2% or $6 million even with the impact of the cyber incident.\nIn Macau, our adjusted property EBITDAR of $226 million was a 23% increase compared to the third quarter of 2019. We achieved 28% margins helps them what, by a benefit of $18 million from hold in the quarter. Casino revenues exceeded third quarter 2019 levels, primarily driven by our main floor win. And discounts and incentives as a percentage of gross win were 600 basis points lower compared to 2019, mainly due to the shift from VIP to mass. BetMGM is well on pace to achieve its forecast of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion in net revenues from operations for the year. Our 50% share of BetMGM's operating income in the third quarter was $13 million, marking our first quarter of profitability at BetMGM. We now anticipate fourth quarter corporate expense to be roughly $115 million bringing full year corporate expense less share-based compensation to approximately $450 million.\nThis upward adjustment relates to incentive fees in Japan related to the signing of the implementation agreement IT and cybersecurity issue related expenses as well as costs related to the integration of the Cosmopolitan. On the development front, in Japan, we expect to commit approximately $2 billion over the next 5 years. Our New York expansion, if approved, will be an all-in project estimated also at $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion will be invested on improvements and $500 million expected for the license fee. We plan to fully fund these projects through free cash flow generated by our operations.\nI'll conclude with an overview of our free cash flow per share growth algorithm and it's pretty straightforward. First, we're committed to growing EBITDAR by improving our core operational performance, deploying growth capital and high-return projects and by focusing on margins. We create operating leverage by growing our EBITDAR more than our fixed 2% rent escalators. Second, we'll continue to buy back our shares as evidenced by the new $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board. In addition to returning share -- or cash to our shareholders, these repurchases turbocharge our free cash flow per share growth. And there is more free cash flow growth on the horizon as we're making significant progress with BetMGM, and we have those 2 exciting growth projects in the pipeline. With that, Bill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. And just some open comments before we talk questions. I'm reminded about the resiliency of this market in our company and our employees. Candidly, this quarter, we went to hell in back with what we all went through with Cybertech. And I'm proud of what we've accomplished, put ourselves back on track. But more importantly, I think as an indicator of this market, fundamentals have changed. We've gone from a month ago in distress to getting ready for the biggest event on one of the second worst weekends as City has ever seen in its ongoing history of occupancy to the biggest event we've ever seen with Formula 1. And so fundamentally, this marketplace has changed. Macau continues to do exceptionally well. Very proud of that team.\nYou've seen the market share that it has gained and it will keep. And given that we ultimately have about 3% of the suite product I think we're kicking on all cylinders there and doing the right things, and we're going to look to correct that. If I think about the future, I think about development in Japan in the long haul, hopefully, New York in the midterm, and next year, I think about the ability to unleash 180 million Bonvoy members and Marriott, I get very excited.\nAnd then ultimately, the balance sheet. I think we've been very good fiduciaries. I think the company, Jonathan of note, has done a great job managing it. And we find ourselves in a great position to think about the future and things to do and invest in. And with that, operator, I will open this up for questions. So thank you."

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. I'm happy to share that MGM Resorts posted an all-time record for consolidated net revenues in the second quarter. We achieved strong earnings across our domestic portfolio with near record second quarter adjusted property EBITDA results at MGM China and the first quarter of positive EBITDA at BetMGM. At a high level, we're seeing strong demand trends in Las Vegas, with casino drop and handle up year-over-year, alongside increasing hotel revenues with our fourth quarter hotel revenues forecasted to be the highest of all time.\nIn our regional operations, we achieved year-over-year top line growth on a same-store basis, taking into consideration the sale of the Gold Strike Tunica with profit margins in the range of prior quarters. We are continuing to evaluate our business and evolve our products to ensure that we are maximizing profit while maintaining great customer service levels.\nOur second quarter results are a continued testament to our 75,000-plus employees and their commitment to offering world-class service and memories for our guests. Simply stated, our employees are the best in the business, and I want to thank them for helping us deliver another outstanding quarter in Las Vegas and our regional locations and ultimately, in Macau.\nWhile we're certainly pleased with the results we've achieved in the first half of this year, we frankly are even more excited about what's to come in the back half, starting with the historic long-term agreement with Marriott International that we announced last month. As part of this agreement, we've created a new MGM collection with Marriott Bonvoy, allowing its more than 180 million members to book rooms and earn and redeem Marriott Bonvoy points at 17 MGM Resorts domestic properties.\nThis agreement will enhance our profitability by driving lower customer acquisition costs and with a better mix in the higher ADRs and on property spend. By 2025, our expectation is that the Marriott customer base represent a meaningful segment of our hotel mix at premium rates. Jonathan will expand further on this business case in his section.\nI'd like to personally thank Tony Capuano and his team for their partnership and collaboration throughout this effort, and we can't wait to get started in the fall. Looking into the third quarter, we have great programming, including Black Hat at Mandalay Bay, Magic at the Convention Center and Beyoncé at Allegiant. Bookings are strengthening for the remainder of the year and as we get close to the Formula One in November. We've also got a great fall home schedule for the Raiders, which will have fans flocking into Vegas from Green Bay, Pittsburgh, Kansas City and New England, among other cities that all travel well.\nFor Formula One, while still early, we already have twice the occupancy on the books and at 4x the average rate compared to last year and with more than 70% of our ticket inventory already committed. A portion of these tickets will go to our gaming customers, and early front money and credit data suggest that Formula One is shaping up to be an all-time record casino event for the company.\nOur pace into the second quarter of 2024 is also setting up quite well -- excuse me, in the first quarter, highlighted by the Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium in February. We're already seeing stronger rates in a typical Super Bowl weekend with exceptional early business from sponsors and media that has led to 3 to 4x higher room rates on the books.\nLooking longer term, we're excited by the possibilities of welcoming the to Las Vegas literally in our front yard at the current Tropicana site. The AS is proposing a 30,000-seat stadium, representing an additional 2.4 million seats every year during the regular season, that should drive over 400,000 new tourists the focus on midweek business. The Raiders and the Stanley Cup Champion Golden Knights have shown that Las Vegas is the go-to destination for wave fan seeking a fun entertaining getaway to see their favorite teams play and when we think the AS will be no different.\nThe A Stadium, Allegiant and T-Mobile, represent 100,000 seats holding 3 professional sports teams that are directly adjacent to one or more of our properties with a possibility for multiple events on the same day. It's clear that Las Vegas has become the world's premier sports and entertainment destination.\nTurning to Macau. We posted another outstanding quarter of performance at adjusted property EBITDAR surpassing the second quarter of 2019. Margins were in the high 20s, a great story that we feel confident can be sustained for the long term. Our outsized performance in Macau as a result of exceptional execution by the team at MGM China, who has done an incredible job positioning our properties to main share in the mid-teens and the market that has seen significant increase in hotel supply during the quarter.\nJust a few weeks ago, we reconfigured an enhanced Pit 7 at MGM Macau, and the Lotus room and MGM Cotai and expect to complete the deployment optimization in Q3 of our tables. In Macau, we are focused on 4 key priorities: activating our incremental 200 tables; making optimistic changes to our casino floor to maximize yield; taking care of our premium mass customers; and driving international customers to our property through our global branch office network.\nWe're committed to helping shape the future of Macau as a global tourism destination through our concession commitments with investments being beginning this year. They capital will cover a wide range of opportunities, including investments in art and culture, entertainment and the expansion of our international customer base. I'd like to thank the Macau's government for their continued support.\nTurning now to BetMGM. As the team announced last week, we are on track for second half 2023 profitability, and we're pleased with the meaningful progress we've made towards single account, single wallet. In fact, this week, we expect to be live with this feature in 14 markets, which cover more than 50% of our database.\nOur partners announced acquisition of Angstrom is also a positive step towards improving BetMGM's product and refining our pricing tools, both of which we expect to drive customer satisfaction and ultimately, margins. One of the meaningful benefits that MGM Resorts brings to BetMGM is 37,000 rooms in Las Vegas that import new customers nightly. All of our resort guests are exposed to BetMGM marketing throughout their stay.\nAnd on average, BetMGM acquires 30,000 customers monthly, who have originated or had a prior relationship with MGM Resorts, with half of those coming from Nevada. As we roll out single account, single wallet across the country, that MGM will be able to truly activate our unparalleled footprint in Las Vegas as part of our omnichannel strategy.\nWe expect acquisition and engagement metrics to grow as players get to enjoy seamless experience using the BetMGM app across state borders. We're also focused on growing our international digital business through LeoVegas. And last quarter announced an acquisition of Push Gaming, a gaming content studio. That acquisition is scheduled to close later this fall. We developed our digital presence internationally through improved content, technology and distribution.\nNow lastly, on the development front, in New York, we hope to receive a license in the first half of 2024. In Japan, next step is entering into an implementation agreement with the central government, which we also expect in the fall. In closing, our agreement with Marriott, ongoing investments into our operations and a fantastic sports entertainment backdrop in Las Vegas position us well to create operating leverage by growing our EBITDAR against our fixed rent escalators.\nThe stability of our domestic business will be supplemented by outsized earnings opportunities in Macau as that business ramps in the beginning of profitability in BetMGM. We also have longer tail opportunities with our developments in Japan and New York and with our international digital strategy with LeoVegas. When you connect each of these opportunities for cash flow generation together, add to the strength of our balance sheet and with more cash than debt, then excluding MGM China, then consider the fact that we reduced our share count by approximately 30% since the beginning of 2021, we believe the company is tremendously positioned for growth as we accelerate our free cash flow yield.\nWith that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan for more detail on the quarter. Jonathan?\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Bill. And I, too, want to start my remarks by thanking our employees for all their hard work in delivering another robust quarter of results. Bill said, our employees are the best in the business, and I couldn't agree more. In the second quarter, we achieved strong earnings across our domestic portfolio and near second quarter all-time record adjusted property EBITDAR results at MGM China.\nBefore I get into the results, let me begin with the financial benefits we believe the Marriott agreement brings to MGM. In Las Vegas, MGM Resorts fills roughly 12 million room nights a year. Based on data from the Cosmopolitan as well as Marriott, we believe we can replace approximately 5% to 7% of our lowest yielding rooms with Marriott direct bookings, representing 600,000 to 800,000 rooms per year.\nUpgrading these lower-yielding room nights with Marriott brings a lower customer acquisition costs, higher ADR and a higher-yielding customer with more on property spend. Based on our research and our prior experience with the Cosmopolitan, we expect to increase profit per room by approximately $100 per night, driving $60 million to $75 million in annual profit once stabilized.\nThis estimate doesn't include any further upside from our regional operations, group or occupancy lift. All in all, we're excited about this agreement with Marriott and look forward to kicking things off in October.\nNow turning to our results. Our consolidated businesses generated all-time record revenues of $3.9 billion, up 21% from last year and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.1 billion. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $577 million. Less capital expenditures, free cash flow was $323 million. It's important to note that $166 million in cash flow from operating activities and $14 million in CapEx related to MGM China were included in the quarter.\nHere in Las Vegas, revenues of $2.1 billion were steady compared to prior year, and adjusted property EBITDAR was down 6% to $777 million. It's a good number for Las Vegas. On a same-store basis, excluding the Mirage and the Cosmopolitan, revenues were level and adjusted property EBITDAR decreased 8%. Margins of 36% were well above 2019 levels. Second quarter occupancy was 96%, and ADR was $234, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\nLooking forward, our pace, which reflects on the books rooms, is up year-over-year for every month beginning in 2023 -- or, remaining in 2023. In terms of where we are seeing strength in Las Vegas, it's clear that it's coming from the luxury segment, which for this purpose, we define as our properties, which have a higher ADR than the strip average of $185, and that's our business.\nThis segment represents approximately 65% of our rooms and over 80% of our EBITDAR in the second quarter. In the regions, revenues of $926 million were down 3% compared to prior year and adjusted property EBITDAR was down 14% to $294 million. Of course, this quarter, we did not have the results of the Gold Strike. So same-store revenues, excluding the Gold Strike, grew 2% with adjusted property EBITDAR decreasing 7%.\nWe continue to see stable trends in our regional operations. And while EBITDAR was down year-over-year on a same-store basis, most of that decline is attributable to 2 properties: the Borgata and MGM Grand Detroit, both of which lead their highly competitive markets. Regional adjusted EBITDAR margins were 32% in the quarter. As you will recall, in the third quarter of 2022, we brought back our normal service and amenity levels to our regional properties, which has led to consistent margins in the 32% to 33% range sense.\nTurning to Macau. Our adjusted property EBITDAR of $209 million was an increase of 21% versus the second quarter of 2019 with a 28% margin. Gross gaming revenues exceeded second quarter 2019 levels, led by our main floor win, which was 37% higher than 2019. The flow-through created from net revenues to adjusted property EBITDAR was over 100% when compared to 2019. We made progress in improving MGM China's credit profile with the July announcement of the amendment and extension of our 2 revolving credit facilities with a new maturity date in 2026, and this was an important step in security and extending our access to liquidity.\nIn the first half of 2023, BetMGM generated net revenues associated with operations of $944 million, which is an improvement of 55% compared to the first half last year. BetMGM is well on track to achieve our forecast of $1.8 billion to $2 billion in net revenues from operations for the year. Our 50% of BetMGM's operating losses in the second quarter were $22 million.\nAs you recall, BetMGM -- sorry, MGM reports BetMGM 1 month in arrears. So our second quarter reporting reflects March through May, and that explains the variance to BetMGM's positive EBITDA in the calendar quarter. Let me close on capital allocation and valuation. As we just lapped the 1-year mark at the Cosmopolitan and with the Mirage and Gold Strike transactions behind us, it's a good time to reflect on the impact of these portfolio moves on our financial picture.\nWe committed a net $460 million of capital to our domestic opcos with the acquisition of the Cosmopolitan and the subsequent dispositions of the Mirage and the Gold Strike. On a trailing 12-month basis, the incremental adjusted property EBITDAR generated from the Cosmopolitan less the amount lost with the dispositions was $258 million.\nBacking out the change to cash rent with these transactions results in a net increase of $188 million on $460 million of capital. This implies a creation multiple of 2.4x or said another way, a return on investment of 41% for a property, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, that is now the youngest in our Las Vegas portfolio with the attending low CapEx requirement.\nWe take capital allocation seriously here, and we're proud of these moves and the execution of the Cosmopolitan, which made it all possible. This year, through today, we also returned capital to shareholders by purchasing over 28 million shares for $1.2 billion. We're currently trading at 30% higher than our average weighted cost of shares since the program resumed in early 2021, yet our valuation still remains very attractive.\nIn our earnings presentation posted this afternoon, I revisit our adjusted EBITDA multiple at current trading levels. Using consensus valuation estimates for our share of BetMGM and the current market value of MGM China, we're trading at 5x trailing adjusted EBITDA. Bill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Hopefully, you've heard the business case come through loud and clear. MGM Resorts offers consistent earnings through our Las Vegas and regional properties with near-term growth and diversification through BetMGM shift to profitability and MGM's China's rapid inflection as well as long-term growth opportunities in international, digital and to our expansion efforts in New York and Japan, plus a fortified balance sheet allows us the ability to make optimistic investments and acquisitions as well as return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nAs Jonathan mentioned, we believe our shares will still be priced at an attractive level. And as we stand today, I am certainly encouraged by our ability to grow free cash flow significantly and believe as a sum of the parts evaluation we included in the deck suggests our core business is trading at multiples, well below our competitors, providing you for future growth and value to our shareholders. With that, operator, we'll take questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Chapman. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmrcom. We've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank all of you for joining us today. I'd like to start by highlighting the recent news with the Japanese central government officially certified our area development plan in Osaka, which is a recognition of our perseverance and the great partnership that we have forged after more than a dozen years. This is one of the final steps to pave us the way for us to begin our development process in Osaka to create what would likely be the first grated resort in Japan. I'd like to thank the government of Japan, the City of Osaka, our local partner, Orix, and Ed Bowers and the development team and the many MGM employees who helped make this reality. It's truly an higher, and we look forward to getting started on this major development to increase our global reach and fulfill our strategy to increase our geographic diversification. .\nTurning to results. MGM Resorts posted just an outstanding quarter of financial performance to start 2023 driven by another record Las Vegas quarter and significant recovery at our MGM China. MGM China is experiencing a rapid recovery following the lift of public health policy restrictions. Our first quarter outperformance in Macau is a direct result of the meticulous preparation and well-executed plan put together by our team in MGM China who ensured that we are ready to capture market share and drive results upon reopening.\nI'll point to a few KPIs to reflect our impressive start to the year in Macau. In the first quarter, our MGM China properties generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $169 million or 88% of our first quarter 2019 adjusted property EBITDAR. Our market share was 15% during the quarter, and we are confident in our ability to sustain share as we put in place key structural advantages, including: one, we gained an additional 200 tables as part of the concession renewal process. This represents a 33% increase in the tables for MGM in a market with fixed table allocations. Currently, our half of our incremental tables are fully in use and the remaining will be added as demand returns and we complete further refurbishments on the casino floors.\nWe also enhanced our property and remodels on the casino floors in both MGM Macau and MGM Cotai to focus on mass and premium mass along with adding 57 high-end villa suites at our Cotai property. In addition, we also have the advantage of our global sales international branch marketing network. We are actively leveraging our customer database to bring global customers to our properties.\nWhile we recognize that additional hotel supply will enter the market, these drivers, along with a deep customer understanding from our property leadership, I believe, will allow MGM China to maintain its share in the teens. I'd also like to thank the Macau SAR government for their partnership, and we look forward to working alongside them as we support Macau's positioning as a world center for tourism and leisure.\nMoving stateside, we have once again achieved exceptional results in Las Vegas with a record-breaking first quarter. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of record EBITDAR, and we owe it all to the hard work and dedication of our thousands of employees. This quarter's Strip performance was fueled by a fantastic calendar sports events, including, for the first time, hosting Sweet 16 and March Madness and other entertainment and convention events at our properties and throughout the city.\nThe quality and consistency of entertainment and sports programming at MGM Resorts and throughout Las Vegas has been a catalyst for the permanent transformation and strength and demand of our offerings. This is no better example than Formula One, which, as you know, will come to Las Vegas for the first time this November.\nAdditionally, we are laser-focused on continuing to invest in our properties with a handful of capital and projects on the Strip. At Bellagio, we are completing a 3-year remodel of all rooms and suites with our Spot Tower. This is in addition to enhancing our high-end gaming offering with a newly remodeled Club Prove for high-end table games customers and our [indiscernible] just reopened after a full renovation. We have begun construction of a pedestrian bridge to connect the cost from Pulp in Las Vegas with Bellagio and Vedar. We are undergoing a full upgrade of our Mandalay Bay Convention Center along with numerous restaurants, bars, entertainment outlets and significant room models at New York, New York, MGM and the Water Club at Borgata. By the way, will soon carry the MGM flag alongside Borgata's brand. These initiatives will be drivers of our customer loyalty and spend and ultimately future free cash flow.\nUnder our regional portfolio which showed consistent year-over-year top line growth with stable profitability. I'd like to specifically recognize the Boreas team and congratulate them for executing well on a beautiful room remodel, which is completed in 2022 and is seeing a very strong customer response.\nTurning now to BetMGM. In the first quarter, we expanded our footprint by launching in Ohio and Massachusetts, bringing our total active markets to 26. Based on results thus far, BetMGM remains on track to hit fiscal '23 revenue guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. BetMGM is also continuing to make progress towards profitability later this year, all while continuing to expand and improve its product offering with our joint venture partner, Entain.\nAs we look at this business, we are encouraged by the improving economics that will translate into long-term profitability. As a reminder, as states mature and we focus on growing our NGR, optimizing retention bonus-ing and focusing on most profitable players, overall CPAs will decrease and the conversion from GGR to NGR will increase ultimately driving profitability.\nInternationally, we announced today that the first major investment by our subsidiary, LeoVegas, with LeoVegas entering in an agreement to acquire the majority of a game developer Push Gaming. Push is a proprietary content provider that will allow LeoVegas to grow its library of games as they extend their digital gaming presence to new markets. Push offers several industry-leading games to over 200 operators globally.\nOn the development front, we are working through the RFA process in New York. We plan to submit our official application in this summer and hope to receive a response by the first half of next year. We continue to expect total spend in New York to be approximately $2 billion, inclusive of the licensing fee. And should we win a license to New York, our plan is for extensive property improvements such as a new 5,000-seat theater, new food and beverage outlets, covered parking and an increase overall to the casino floor space. We will share more specifics as part of our submission process continues.\nNow back to Japan. As we progress, we see great opportunity. Osaka has approximately 30 million people within a 3-hour transit time of our site in Yumeshima. Our site in Osaka is also expected to drive international tourism in Japan given its proximity to other major Asian countries. And I will remind all that Osaka is closer to many Northern Chinese cities than any other gaming market. Considering that, we will likely be our integrated resource offering for the first integrated resort offering for some time in Japan. We believe this project will generate a minimum to high-teens free cash flow yield.\nPutting it all together, MGM Resorts offers steady earnings power through our existing operations and world-class brands, plus significant growth opportunity through our digital business, the recovery in Macau and our development opportunities. Our balance sheet boasts impressive strengths with $4.5 billion of cash, excluding MGM China, as shown in the presentation.\nNow to Jonathan for more detail on the quarter.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Extended Stay America, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. And I too want to at our employees for delivering another record quarter of financial results. I'd also like to recognize and thank our teams in both Japan and Macau for their outstanding wins this quarter.\nDigging into the numbers, our consolidated businesses generated revenues of $3.9 billion this quarter, up 36% from last year, and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.1 billion.\nAn even more impressive story was our free cash flow. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $704 million. Less capital expenditures, free cash flow was $564 million. It's important to note that $184 million in cash flow from operating activities and $6 million of CapEx related to MGM China in the quarter. This was a particularly strong quarter in free cash flow due not only to our operating results but also timing of taxes, interest payments and ramping of CapEx.\nOur operating results certainly benefited from a recovery of MGM China as Macau reopened and our team executed on their reopening plan. Gross gaming revenue or win at MGM China ramped to 78% of 2019 in the first quarter or $663 million compared to less than 50% market-wide GGR recovery. This increase was driven by our main floor GGR, which exceeded 2019 levels in the first quarter. Adjusted property EBITDAR was $169 million, 88% of 2019 first quarter levels, and margin was 27% compared to 26% in 2019.\nHere in Las Vegas, margins of 38% remained in line with our performance for the last several quarters. On a year-over-year basis, our revenues grew $513 million and our adjusted property EBITDAR grew $242 million, representing a flow-through of 47%. These results are a testament to the market leadership of our properties, our pricing strategy and expense controls.\nFirst quarter occupancy was 92% and ADR was $258, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, our pace, which reflects on the books rooms, is up year-over-year for every month from now until November.\nFood and beverage is also worth highlighting this quarter as it benefited from the 14 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 38% increase in restaurant covers. Food and beverage revenues were up 52% and banquet spend, which is one of our highest margin businesses, grew 84% due to the recovery in our group segment versus a year ago. In the regionals, first quarter same-store revenues, that excludes Gold Strike, grew 10% with adjusted property EBITDAR up 6% year-over-year.\nBetMGM generated net gaming revenues from operations of $476 million in the first quarter representing a 76% increase over 2022. BetMGM's market share was 28% in iGaming and, when blended with online sports betting, had 17% market share in the U.S. across states in which it operates. Our 50% share of BetMGM operating losses was $82 million, which represents our highest expected loss of the year as the first quarter is a heavy acquisition period with Super Bowl and March Madness plus launches in 2 states.\nAt the cohort level, the data is showing robust player economics and a successful bonus optimization strategy. Same-store NGR from online sports increased 100% in the first quarter and BetMGM remains on course to profitability later in 2023.\nBefore turning it back to Bill, I'll conclude, as usual, with a few observations on our free cash flow and our financial algorithm more generally. We're in an enviable position financially. Our collection of superior properties in Las Vegas, together with the stable operating performance of our regional portfolio, generates ample free cash flow from our domestic operations. BetMGM is fully capitalized now, growing rapidly and turning toward profitability later this year. Our Macau Enterprise is already operating at near pre-pandemic levels. Our balance sheet is strong and highly liquid. At the end of the quarter, excluding China, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, as shown in the presentation, and more cash than debt, creating a net cash position of $1.3 billion. All of this allows us to invest for growth, delever and repurchase shares, steadily reducing our share count.\nIn the first quarter, we completed the sale of the Gold Strike Tunica for $450 million in gross proceeds. We received $170 million in the early prepayment of the note receivable that was secured by excess land from our Circus Circus transaction. We repaid [ $1.25 billion ] for our 6% notes. In April, we paid $138 million to a minority investor in National Harbor as a result of the sale of their economic interest, and we agreed to purchase real estate between the Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas to enable connectivity among these properties going forward. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of Push Gaming, augmenting our international digital strategy. The Japan and New York development opportunities lie before us, and we expect them to offer attractive free cash flow yields for our shareholders.\nThis year, through today, we've repurchased 16 million shares for $654 million, excluding excise tax, and that represents 4% of our share count. And we'll continue to repurchase shares, capturing the free cash flow yield on our shares, reducing our share count and growing free cash flow per share.\nBill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. A couple of comments, and then we'll open it up for questions. I got to say, I'm extremely proud of the entire team. It's arguably one of our best quarters ever. If you think about the overall performance, Las Vegas, Macau, the major development news we had in Japan, our pursuit of New York, things are going exceptionally well there. Jonathan just mentioned, and obviously, it's our intent, that MGM is an inflection point. And then we continue to push through LeoVegas and grow our digital business on an international scale.\nWe are obviously now almost a year into our acquisition of Cosmopolitan. And so we couldn't be happier with the position in the leading resorts we have here in Las Vegas. We have 4 of the country's top 8 regional casinos in terms of performance, which fortifies the effort that we have here not only those markets but sending people back to Las Vegas. And we have a fortified balance sheet that still continues to allow us to buy back the shares that we think appropriate and invest in our company's future.\nWith that, operator, we'll open it up to any questions."

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm proud to announce that MGM Resorts International drove record fourth quarter adjusted property EBITDAR for Las Vegas and regional resorts. What's more, our full year Las Vegas Strip adjusted property EBITDAR increased by more than 80% year-over-year. These outstanding results are evidence of our focus on optimizing growth in our business and operations as well as our strategic vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company.\nThese outcomes are also a testament to our employees, who will go above and beyond every day to take care of our guests and create an amazing, great experiences, which drive loyalty among our customers. Our employees are true heroes of this story, and we -- need to be celebrated. I couldn't be proud of them for delivering these financial results alongside the steady improving guest and record employee satisfaction scores we are enjoying.\nAs we look forward, we expect many of the drivers for our 2022 performance to continue into 2023. Importantly, we are well positioned on weathering a variety of environments, given the inherent long-term benefits of MGM's diverse portfolio. In fact, we have the most diverse offerings in the gaming space. And as such, we are a well-balanced organization that benefits from both scale and a host of premier brand offerings.\nThis distinction -- the distinct pieces of our business that creates this diversification are: number one, our number of 9 Las Vegas Strip and 8 regional domestic properties in the U.S. that catered to all market segments and produced consistently strong profitability; two, our 2 integrated resorts in Macau, the pre-pandemic generated EBITDAR of over $700 million and are just now beginning to see a very real return to profitability; three, our digital strategy with 50% ownership of BetMGM, one of the leading U.S. digital sports betting and gaming operators. BetMGM is the leader in what is financially the most important segment in the nation, iGaming, and is making overall progress towards its profitability; and our ownership of LeoVegas, which we're using to grow our digital business internationally and extend both MGM's brand and content reach; and ultimately, our balance sheet, allowing significant flexibility to invest in areas with the highest return on capital including New York, Japan, further expanding our digital footprint via LeoVegas and other substantive international opportunities we're pursuing in that space as well as funding and continued share repurchases. In fact, as you know, we have just announced that our Board approved another $2 billion repurchase program.\nLooking ahead, we see multiple opportunities for growth and momentum in our business, coupling these opportunities with a relentless focus on free cash flow per share, our operating model, our margin control and disciplined expense management, which we believe gives us a great confidence that our best days are ahead of us.\nLet me walk through the business case for '23, starting with our U.S. properties. First, we are encouraged by the early success of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas as we migrate the business into MGM Resorts infrastructure. On an annualized basis, we have double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDAR compared to the reported 12-month period prior to the acquisition. We are already beginning to produce cross-property play with hundreds of high-end players from The Cosmopolitan database attending MGM Resorts customer events and driving millions and win at our other sister properties. This is a trend that we saw continued for the Lunar New Year celebration at our properties in Las Vegas, and we expect to expand to the mass market as we integrate MGM Rewards into The Cosmopolitan system.\nNext, we have a strong event calendar in Las Vegas. CES is 115,000 attendees last month, up from 45,000 in 2022. CONEXPO and ConAg next month is setting up to be the best ever. And March Madness, Sweet 16 and the Elite 8 games are coming to Las Vegas. Together, the calendar in March is positioned to have us have the best hotel revenue month, we believe, in our history.\nAdditionally, Formula 1 is expected to bring $1 billion in economic value to the city, which we believe we are the best positioned to take advantage of. Las Vegas also has Allegiant Stadium, which has brought 40 events and over 1.5 million visitors to Las Vegas in 2022 and is expected to bring even more visitors, even higher quality events in 2023, driving significant spend, particularly at our South end properties.\nAnother tailwind is the ongoing growth in visitation. The LVCVA expects domestic flight growth capacity to reach 120% of 2019 in the first quarter of 2023, and internationally recover further with 80% of 2019 available seats. Harry Reid Airport hosted a record $52.6 million passengers in 2022.\nOutside of our domestic business, we also see tremendous opportunities for growth, starting with China, fully stated Macau is back. As you well know, COVID restrictions impacted our Macau operations in 2022, causing an operational loss that negatively impacted our overall results. But we are experiencing a rebound in 2023 as our guests are returning in force just that they did in Las Vegas when restrictions were lifted here. In fact, quarter-to-date, we are excited to report that MGM China's combined properties are the highest earning businesses within our company.\nAs part of the concession renewal process, we committed to bring nongaming entertainment events to Macau. Those events were strong drivers to visitation to our property during the Lunar New Year and at the end of January. We see these early results as validation in our confidence in Macau markets recovery and the long-term viability upon which where retendering commitments were built. And unique to MGM China, we have secured 200 additional tables as part of our new gaming concession, which, combined with our premier mass positioning, should allow us to drive market share into low to mid-teens. In fact, during the month of January, our market share was 16%, which compares to high single-digit market shares pre-pandemic.\nThis outstanding performance was driven by the MGM Chinese team, strategic focus delivering full gaming floor renovation, a complete hotel product mix for our targeted customers various marketing efforts in producing strong nongaming events, shows and promotions plus our team's improvement in service levels and operational efficiencies. These collective efforts position us for a long-term growth story in Macau. We've also reason to be optimistic about the growth prospects of our business well into the remainder of this decade, especially in light of the 2 new gaming licenses that we hope to receive in the near future.\nWe expect to submit our RFA in New York in the first half of this year, and we hope for response in the near future. One advantage we have over the competition in this market is our ability to add tables to our existing casino floor and, thus, incremental tax revenue for the state almost instantly once approved for license. We expect to spend about $2 billion in New York, inclusive of the license fee. We will fine-tune our program and planning. But right now, we're expecting extensive property improvements such as significant entertainment offering, new food and beverage opportunities, covered parking and an overall increase in the casino floor space.\nAs you may recall, we also submitted our RFP in Japan for an integrated resort license to operate in Osaka approximately 10 months ago. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for the response from the government, but we are being patient and believe we will hear so soon. MGM Resorts has presented a compelling offer with our partner, Orix, to develop an integrated resort, which will develop international tourism and growth to that region. We're extremely excited for the ROI opportunity in a market in which we may be the sole operator for some time in the future. Each of the projects I just mentioned are expected to generate returns well above our current free cash flow yield. These and all future capital investment decisions, we weighed upon that same standard.\nIn closing, 2022 was a phenomenal year for MGM Resorts, and we're confident we will see progress into 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn this over to Jon for more color on the fourth quarter and the year.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nCFO & Treasurer, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks very much, Bill. Before I dig into the financial results, let me also thank my colleagues here at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly amazing year. I'll now share with you some of the exceptional financial results that we achieved.\nLas Vegas Strip same-store revenues, and so that's excluding The Cosmopolitan and The Mirage, grew 11% and adjusted property EBITDAR grew 6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Fourth quarter occupancy of 91% was up 500 basis points year-over-year and ADR was $260 in the fourth quarter, which grew 30% over last year. Several volume metrics for us set records as well as our Las Vegas slot handle set its seventh consecutive quarterly record in the fourth quarter.\nDemand in Las Vegas remains strong across all segments, driven by our exceptional entertainment offerings and other customer demand drivers. The strength continued into January, where occupancy was 90% and rooms booked during the month were on record pace with rates up double digits to last year.\nIn the regions, fourth quarter revenues grew 10% and adjusted property EBITDAR grew 3% year-over-year. While EBITDA was down 1% versus the third quarter, this sequential decline is in line with normal seasonality for the fourth quarter. Importantly, labor expense as a percentage of revenues was flat sequentially and our current headcount remains approximately 20% below 2019 levels, all while we achieved historic highs in NPS and other indicative customer satisfaction.\nIn the fourth quarter, corporate expense, excluding stock compensation, was $113 million, which includes $5 million related to MGM China; global development costs of $6 million; and transaction costs of $2 million. Going forward, we expect corporate expense for the full year 2023 to be approximately $380 million to $400 million, a decrease of approximately $30 million to $50 million from 2022. Included in MGM's corporate expense this year is $44 million for MGM China and approximately $37 million in anticipated development expense related to Japan and New York.\nWe intend to invest approximately $800 million in domestic CapEx in 2023, and this compares to the $727 million in CapEx invested in 2022. Maintenance capital will be approximately $600 million of this spend this year. And this year, it includes room remodels in the Bellagio Spa Tower, Borgata's Water Club and the completion of our New York-New York room renovation. Since 2019, we've reduced the average age of our room since renovation by roughly 3.5 years, and our room age will continue to decrease over the coming years as we refresh our room offerings.\nThe remaining CapEx in 2023 is growth capital, projects that include the Mandalay Bay Convention Center remodel, a new pedestrian bridge connecting The Cosmopolitan to Vdara and investments in technology to drive better customer experience, ease and engagement.\nFinally, on the development front, we expect to contribute $70 million -- $75 million to BetMGM in 2023 and the only material investment in New York this year will be the $500 million license fee, depending upon the timing of the license awards.\nI'll conclude with just a few comments on our strategy for capital allocation. First and foremost, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by sustaining adequate liquidity for our enterprise. And as you can see in the presentation that we posted today, we concluded 2022 with $5.3 billion of domestic cash against domestic debt of $4.5 billion. Our resources this year were bolstered by the disposition of The Mirage in December for $850 million in net cash proceeds after tax. Next week, we expect to close on the sale of the Gold Strike in Tunica, which will be in $350 million in net proceeds after tax.\nNext, we'll prioritize capital investment to deliver the highest return for our shareholders. Our acquisition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas expanded our reach into the high end of the Las Vegas market. Our acquisition of LeoVegas, jump-started our international iGaming strategy. Our new President of Interactive, Gary Fritz and his team are evaluating a number of opportunities in this area, and our shareholders should expect that we'll be deploying more capital to grow the MGM brand internationally in iGaming and in digital content development.\nAnd finally, we're going to return capital to shareholders. During 2022, we repurchased 76 million shares for $2.8 billion. Since the beginning of 2021 through yesterday, we've repurchased $124 million for a total of $4.7 billion and have reduced our share count to 375 million shares. And we're not done. As Bill mentioned, our Board of Directors yesterday approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program.\nIn evaluating our share repurchase strategy, I consider a number of factors, including the liquidity profile of the company as well as the development and M&A opportunities that are before us. But I also consider the free cash flow yield available in our own shares. So as I conclude, consider the following: adjusted property EBITDAR from Las Vegas last year was approximately $3.1 billion and from our regional operations was $1.3 billion. From that, we had adjusted domestic corporate expense of $400 million and cash rent of $1.7 billion on an annualized basis. Consolidated cash interest was $574 million, but that includes $205 million related to MGM China. And cash taxes and domestic CapEx totaled about $750 million.\nBut our company also has significant reservoirs of value that did not contribute cash earnings in 2022. This includes excess cash of over $2.5 billion; our ownership position in MGM China, which yesterday had an approximate value of $2.6 billion; and of course, our stake in BetMGM. It's a lot of numbers, but when taking all of this into account, I see a double-digit yield opportunity in our shares, which is why I see share repurchases as a responsible and accretive use of our capital.\nBill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. I hope the comments that -- we've conveyed the excitement that we all have towards our business this year and ultimately beyond. In all my time with the company, I've never been more excited about our present and future as I am right now. I think we're stronger, more agile, more focused and more determined than ever to win. And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions). Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Chapman.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of IR, MGM Resorts International\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com. We've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or otherwise.\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report another phenomenal quarter of financial results driven by our domestic business, with the Las Vegas Strip setting a new record for revenues and adjusted property EBITDAR. These results come on the heels of a record-setting quarter in Las Vegas -- our second quarter in Las Vegas and our regions. Also, the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas had one of its best quarters in its first full quarter of operation under MGM Resorts leadership and continues to outperform our initial expectations. We continue to see further opportunity with the Cosmopolitan as we look to integrate our reward system and improve physical connection to our sister properties.\nNet-net, 2022 is shaping up to be a record year for many of resorts, and we believe a fundamental change in people's perception of travel and the value that it brings to their lives in Las Vegas and MGM Resorts is benefiting this emerging theme. I want to thank our employees, again, for the tremendous efforts they put forward to achieve these outstanding results. We know that our guests are experiencing greater satisfaction in their stays as measured by our internal Net Promoter Scores, which continue to exceed our projections as well as our TripAdvisor rankings, which have improved significantly across our portfolio in the last year.\nPut all together, MGM continues to make great progress towards our long-term vision which is to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. We've achieved this vision by remaining laser-focused on that strategic plan. Let me hit some of the highlights of the quarter, and then Jonathan will dig into the results in more detail. First off, I'm pleased to share that we have completed our acquisition of LeoVegas in September. This important acquisition represents the first step of an aggressive expansion in international and online gaming for MGM. I'd like to again welcome Gustaf Hagman and the team. And we also recently announced the addition of Gary Fritz as our President of Interactive. Gary will lead our broader digital strategy both here in the U.S. and internationally, which LeoVegas is a significant part.\nStaying with digital for a moment, we remain bullish on BetMGM, which continues to build on its success every quarter. In the third quarter, BetMGM launched in Kansas representing its 24th market to date and the eighth new market we have added since November of last year. Looking forward, we will add Massachusetts, Ohio and Maryland, to our online sports betting portfolio.\nBetMGM remains the clear leader in iGaming with a 29% market share, and BetMGM commands 22% share in active markets when combining U.S. sports betting and iGaming. As we hit the halfway point of the NFL season, we're encouraged by the preliminary metrics, reinvestment has remained within our expectations and market appear to be acting more rationally. As BetMGM shared in May at its Investor Day, our strategy is to focus on profitability by allocating spend to geographies with the highest ROI and targeting bonusing. We believe this is being executed exceptionally well.\nOur investment in BetMGM and LeoVegas will allow us to continue to drive our omnichannel strategy, a key competitive advantage that over time allows us to generate incremental earnings between our brick-and-mortar and our online channels. Early results of this strategy have been positive with a strong acquisition story as well as the creation of brand stickiness. Of the players that play in both channels, we've seen a younger customer, in fact, almost 90% of the BetMGM omnichannel customers who visit Vegas are younger than 50 and over 50% are under the age of 35. Overall, customers who play online at our properties have increased engagement and our lower cost per acquisition which reflects the operating leverage we can and will drive into the future.\nNow I'd like to talk about the integrated resource development opportunities we have. New York State pointed the majority of the Gaming Facility Location Board members in October and we anticipate the state to issue the casinos RFA by early January. We are developing a compelling proposal, and we look forward to submitting it in the coming months. Beyond the United States, MGM and our development partner, Orix, along with the city of Osaka, submitted our area development plan to the government of Japan in April, and we are optimistic that we received certification in the near future. I recently visited our development site and we and the Orix team couldn't be more excited by the opportunity to bring a fully integrated resort to Japan. Turning to Macau. We officially submitted our application for a new concession in September and we remain committed to supporting Macau's continued development as a world-class tourism and leisure destination. We aim to support the Macau government in achieving its diversification goals, and we'll continue to invest in the innovative projects and programs that help the region flourish. The Macau government is in the process of reviewing each of the concessioners proposals and we expect a decision to be made by year-end.\nLet me close by making some high-level comments on the current state of business and our future outlook. Business is exceptionally strong right now in Las Vegas at MGM Resorts and we see the market remaining exceptionally hot. In particular, we are seeing outsized strength in our luxury resorts where pricing remains robust. In fact, October was our highest month ever in terms of hotel revenue. As we look at the Convention segment, which has the longest lead time it gives us visibility into the future, our convention room mix is pacing at our goal of 19% with increased ADRs year-over-year. Our outlook continues to be positive and we're flexing our operations to take full advantage of the demand we're experiencing in the marketplace.\nProgramming also remains an exceptional story which further solidifies Las Vegas as the nation's top sports destination. We will host the men's NCAA West Regional for Sweet 16 & Elite 8 rounds at T-Mobile in March and Formula One, as you know, has selected the weekend of November 16 next year. So it was the first ever Las Vegas race on the strip, that weekend happens to be one of the slowest historic weekends of the year for us ahead of Thanksgiving. We'll open our hotel calendar tomorrow for those states and expect an exceptional demand based on our studies of other host cities. We believe the prime positioning of our properties will allow us to fully capture the benefits of this exciting race.\nSo right now, we have reasons to be optimistic as we look ahead. That said, we're not blind to the overall macroeconomic conditions, and we remain keenly aware of the impact of inflation and the concerns of a potential recession. We continue to stay alert and are actively monitoring our business and indications of a slowdown. Our operations teams have become incredibly nimble over the last few years and are prepared to quickly adjust our business to the changing demand trends if they occur.\nIn the meantime, we'll continue to look for opportunities to drive organic growth in our core business to select key capital investments in our properties and through our MGM Rewards program. MGM Rewards continues to deliver on our promise to provide more compelling benefits to all of our members. In fact, since we launched the new program, we have seen a greater portion of our direct bookings from MGM Rewards members and an increased tier progression, particularly for our Gold Plus players.\nWith that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss more details of the quarter. Jon?\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nCFO & Treasurer, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks very much, Bill. Let me start my remarks by also welcoming Gustaf and the over 900 LeoVegas employees to MGM Resorts. No doubt the future of LeoVegas is bright, and I'm confident this enterprise will serve as a meaningful contributor of talent and earnings to our company. I'd also like to echo Bill's comments and thank all of our employees for the second straight quarter of record results. Our people are the best in the business, and they demonstrate that every day with the care they show for our guests.\nNow let's discuss our third quarter results in some detail. Our consolidated third quarter net revenues were $3.4 billion, an increase of 26% compared to 2021 despite the 70% revenue decline at MGM China due to closures and other COVID-related limitations. On the Las Vegas Strip, top line demand was strong, with same-store net revenues increasing 18% and same-store adjusted property EBITDAR up 8%. Occupancy was a major driver of the improvement year-over-year, reaching 93% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the start of the pandemic, an improvement -- and an improvement of over 1,000 basis points year-over-year. The key driver of the occupancy gain is midweek demand, which is returning to more normal levels as conventions and group's return. The value proposition of our group business supports our pricing power in Las Vegas. ADR hit a record $227 in the third quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year.\nWe continuously work to optimize the hotel mix in our business. Over the past 2 years, we've increased the effectiveness of our casino marketing and loyalty programs to drive the casino and direct high rate transient business mix up by several percentage points each. And this has helped offset the decrease in convention mix that we experienced in 2020 and 2021. Now as our convention mix returns, we're generally displacing less profitable but still important leisure business. This convention business comes at a higher average rate typically between $30 to $40 higher and brings with it higher margin catering spend.\nOur third quarter regional net revenues grew 5%, while adjusted property EBITDAR declined 8%. During the quarter, our highest daily was Casino segment remained our best performing with the greatest increase in both rated days and theoretical win. Our casino customers aged 65 and above grew again this quarter as compared to last year and 2019, but it still hasn't reached the visitation frequency pre-pandemic. Our local and cross-property efforts will continue to address these important segments to drive further growth.\nAdjusted property EBITDAR margins were 33%, a decrease of approximately 450 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. This margin result is consistent with our prior commentary. And as the market stabilize, we expect to maintain 400 to 600 basis points of margin improvement versus 2019. We've increased our employee headcount by low double digits.\nDuring 2021, we faced a difficult hiring environment and had a number of outlet closures, but we're now fully staffed, fully open and have returned to the service levels for which we are known. In Macau, adjusted property EBITDAR was a loss of $70 million in the third quarter of 2022 due to property closures and COVID-19-related policies limiting visitation to the market.\nOn BetMGM, the growth and continued improvement we are seeing in this business is overwhelmingly positive. Our 50% share of the losses in the third quarter narrowed to $24 million, which is reported as a part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. This brings our year-to-date loss to $186 million, and we remain comfortable with our guidance for a $225 million contribution for the year.\nNet revenues associated with BetMGM operations were $400 million this quarter, exhibiting an approximately 90% year-over-year growth from the third quarter last year, led by the continued strength in iGaming and new markets as well as disciplined reinvestments within sports betting by the management team. Through the first 9 months of the year, BetMGM's revenue associated with operations have surpassed $1 billion, which puts them well on track to achieve their target of over $1.3 billion this year.\nLooking forward, improved design and functionality of the BetMGM app, launch of a single wallet and omnichannel growth will be tailwinds behind future growth of their business and its impact to MGM as we look to reach profitability during 2023. Our third quarter corporate expense, including share-based compensation, was $117 million, which included $9 million of transaction costs related mostly to LeoVegas. We do expect corporate expense to remain elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to transaction costs related to the Mirage sale. We're strategically investing our corporate resources in growth areas, including improvements to our IT infrastructure, enhanced digital offerings and our IR development efforts in Japan and New York.\nAnd finally, our capital allocation priorities are as follows. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll invest where we have clear advantages, exercising prudence and measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. And finally, we'll return cash to our shareholders. These priorities will manifest in our major allocation decisions this year. We bolstered our liquidity through the closing of the VICI transaction and the announced sales of the Mirage and Gold Strike. We acquired The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, which strengthened our portfolio. We're making strategic capital deployments into improving our existing product with room remodels across 3 of our major properties and an announced refresh of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center to shore up our long-term group market share.\nWe returned cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares for $307 million. From the beginning of 2021 through yesterday, we've repurchased 115 million shares for $4.4 billion or 32% of our market cap. This activity brings our share count down to 384 million shares. Last quarter, I made the case for the attractive valuation of our shares, and I feel even more strongly now with market-leading domestic operations driving record results, leases limited to 2% or 3% escalation for the next 10 years, embedded cash flow growth in BetMGM and MGM China and about $11 per share in cash I think our stock trades at pretty attractive levels. We plan to continue to buy back stock through our authorized program. And moving forward, we will also continue to invest our capital in growth projects such as New York and Japan as well as strategic M&A.\nWith that, Bill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jon. We believe we've accomplished a great deal year-to-date. I'm optimistic about our path forward. What we are doing is working. Our existing operations continue to grow as evidenced by another record quarter in Las Vegas with a positive outlook thinking about October and beyond. Our balance sheet is in a position of strength as we have more than $6 billion in domestic liquidity with almost no net debt. BetMGM is firing on all cylinders, demonstrating tremendous growth and remains on track to achieve profitability during 2023. We also expect further global digital growth with LeoVegas, MGM China and Macau market are showing some productive signals, and we believe we are well positioned with respect to licensing renewals. Also New York and Japan represent future development growth opportunities for our company. I would again like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and commitment to our company.\nAnd with that, we'll open this up for questions, operator."

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon.\nOur second quarter results represented our highest adjusted property EBITDAR quarter in the history of Las Vegas, both on an absolute and same-store basis, and the highest second quarter in our regionals ever with 7 of our U.S. properties setting all-time records. I again want to sincerely thank our employees for their continued hard work, commitment to excellence and dedication to creating world-class experiences for our guests. Thanks to them, our company's service scores have improved sequentially each quarter, both overall and across all the metrics we track. I could not be more proud of the progress we have seen in servicing our customers.\nBefore I dive into our results in more detail, let me reiterate that our long-term strategic planning remains unchanged. We're focused on continually improving our guest experience, delivering operational excellence, investing in our people and planet and allocating capital responsibly.\nSo let's turn to those results. We took another meaningful step in April to simplify our corporate structure and complete the monetization of our real estate assets with the closing of our strategic transactions between MGM Growth Properties and VICI. This transaction brought us $4.4 billion in cash, which we intend to use to invest in our core businesses while continuing to pursue meaningful growth opportunities. One such opportunity was the acquisition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas that officially closed in May. I've had the opportunity to spend some time at the property and have met a number of the CoStars. I cannot say enough about the strength of the team at the Cosmopolitan and the exceptional service culture that has been created there. Our focus now is on integrating the operations of the property into MGM Resort's portfolio and working together to maximize the future success of this world-class resort.\nWe also recently announced another strategic divestiture in our portfolio. In June, we reached an agreement to sell the operations of the Gold Strike Tunica to the Cherokee Nation for $450 million. As a company, we felt this was an opportunity to sharpen our focus in Mississippi on Beau Rivage and take advantage of an attractive valuation. Gold Strike is a very special property. I'd like to, again, to thank every employee in Tunica for consistently delivering amazing first-class gaming entertainment experiences to our guests. We look forward to seeing Gold Strike continued success with the Cherokee Nation, and we expect this transaction to close in the first part of 2023. The divestiture follows our prior announcement to sell the operation of the Mirage, would still also stay on track for close later this year.\nConsistent with our strategy to grow our international online gaming footprint, we announced in May a tender offer for LeoVegas, a leading global online gaming company with licenses in 8 jurisdictions, primarily in the Nordics. LeoVegas has a talented management team, a cloud and mobile-based technology platform and an appreciable growth plan that we'll execute on as we develop our digital gaming presence in Europe. We also expect this transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.\nShifting now back to focus on our brick-and-mortar development pipeline. We are hopeful that New York will solicit applications by the end of the year for 1 of 3 additional casino licenses. We are eager to respond and expand our existing property in Empire City, which is less than 15 miles from Manhattan with an attractive footprint for development and growth. If we do receive a license, we look forward to working with the state of New York, Yonkers in our surrounding jurisdictions to drive jobs and economic growth to that region.\nIn Japan, we submitted our area development plan to the Japanese government in April and are optimistic that we receive an approval decision in the fall of this year. Following that process, we will share further details about the project.\nAnd in the U.A.E, we continue to make progress on bringing the MGM brand family to Dubai, where we have a management agreement for a nongaming integrated resort that has been developed in partnership with Wasl. The project has broken ground and work continues on the development progress, and we will watch with great interest what does or doesn't happen around gaming in the region, hopefully, in the near future.\nTurning to BetMGM. Adam Greenblatt and the team provided a comprehensive update at their Analyst Day reaffirming their long-term road map and path to profitability. The team at BetMGM is also working on a comprehensive refresh to improve the interface and customer experience later this year. Following a successful launch in Ontario in April, BetMGM announced a partnership with Carnival cruises -- Corporation to provide onboard ship betting and gaming under the BetMGM brand. BetMGM operates now in 23 markets in the United States and Canada, across retail, online sports and iGaming operations.\nIn May, BetMGM committed 21% [and] share in the active markets in both U.S. sports betting and iGaming, which puts us in the #2 position. BetMGM is the clear leader in iGaming and having reached 29% market share in May. And looking forward, with the addition of Ohio, most recently Massachusetts as well as the potential for California, we continue to see great opportunity for expansion with BetMGM. We're accessible to those 3 states over 45 million addressable audience.\nOur investment in BetMGM is an important enabler to our omnichannel strategy and a key competitive advantage that allows us to drive incremental earnings between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. Early results of this strategy have been positive with a strong acquisition story with over 43% of our MGM rewards sign-ups coming from BetMGM versus 33% in Q2 2021. Of these sign-ups, we have seen substantial growth in those who are visiting MGM property for the first time.\nTurning to Macau. Our operations were affected by limited visitation to the region, obviously due to the COVID restrictions. As you've likely seen, the Macau government closed all nonessential businesses in July in the face of rising case counts, which impacted our properties. Last week, we saw operations reopening on a limited basis, and we're working to minimize our operational costs in the short term and position our properties to capture more than our fair share of premium mass business as demand returns, hopefully, in the long term.\nWe're also working on our concession renewal. We are pleased to have received the terms of this tender last week with no surprises with all the submissions due by September 14. The Macau government will then review the submissions and grant new concessions hopefully by year-end. We remain confident in the future of Macau and are proud to be partners in shaping the future of one of the world's premier tourist, entertainment and gaming destinations.\nWhile our second quarter results were nothing short of spectacular, we are, of course, mindful of the marketplace concerns of a potential recession. We also recognize that starting in the back half of the year, we'll be lapping strong comparisons driven by pent-up demand around our reopenings. With all of this in mind, it is important to highlight that we've built an incredibly agile business over the last few years due to COVID and other factors, and we will adjust and pivot quickly if we see any signs of consumer demand slowing. That said, we sit here today, our business and forward-looking pace remains extremely strong. In fact, looking ahead, we continue to be quite bullish on our domestic business outlook based on a number of tailwinds coming in the new year, including a rebound in our convention business, the return of international travel and the lineup of exciting events to Las Vegas.\nLet me touch on a couple of these points a bit more. First, in '23, we expect to grow our convention mix and rate year-over-year. Also in the terms of citywides, we look forward to welcoming CES back in better form and once again the CONEXPO trade show to Las Vegas in March of 2023. This will be their first return post the COVID-shortened 2020 event. One in rotation, this is one of the most well-attended citywide events of the year with historical attendance well north of 130,000.\nAdd to that, the return of international visitation to Las Vegas, which in 2021 represented only 3% of visitors, then 10% to 15% in pre-pandemic year, and our international customers have longer stay patterns than domestic guests, and we expect these guests to return (inaudible) as international flight capacity will reach over 80% of 2019 summer levels.\nAnd finally, the event calendar in Las Vegas is arguably the best the city has ever seen, and MGM will be primary beneficiary even at our scale and positioning. Las Vegas is now truly a powerhouse sports destination with the Golden Knights and Raiders calling Las Vegas home. Looking ahead in '23, the city will host the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 rounds of the [NC2A's] men's tournament and our first ever Formula One race. And then in early February of 2024, we'll play host to the Super Bowl.\nWhen you put it all together, the business case is incredibly compelling for continued growth and momentum in our business. And as Jonathan will describe, we see tremendous value potential in the shares of MGM Resorts.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss the details of the quarter.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nCFO & Treasurer, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks very much, Bill.\nI, too, would like to express my sincere thanks to all of our employees for the incredible results we achieved this quarter. We truly have the best team and the best talent in the business. I also want to acknowledge and thank the employees at the Gold Strike Tunica for their contributions to this great property and also extend my welcome to the CoStars of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.\nSo let's discuss our second quarter results in a bit more detail. Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $3.3 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021, despite a $168 million negative impact from MGM China due to the COVID-related limitations to visitation Bill mentioned in his remarks. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $1.8 billion, benefiting from a gain related to the sale of MGM Growth Properties.\nOur second quarter Las Vegas Strip net revenues were $2.1 billion, and adjusted property EBITDAR for the strip was $825 million. Our same-store net revenues in Las Vegas, which excludes Aria, Vdara and the Cosmopolitan in 2022 increased 60% versus the second quarter of 2021. And same-store adjusted property EBITDAR in Las Vegas was up 51% versus the second quarter last year. Now unlike the visitation or the variation month-to-month that we experienced in the first quarter due to Omicron, our second quarter occupancy, ADR and profitability were consistent through the quarter. Second quarter occupancy was 92%, continuing the strength that we saw when we exited March. As Bill mentioned, pricing remains strong with ADR in the second quarter at a record $225. On a same-store basis, ADR of $201 was 34% above the second quarter of 2021.\nOur pricing power is driven by a number of factors: The attractiveness and sophistication of our marketing efforts; the relative value versus other destination markets; midweek conventions returning; and the benefit of certain room renovations, including the Bellagio and the ARIA Sky Suites, which we completed in 2021.\nOur preliminary results from July are also an encouraging sign for the third quarter with occupancy of 94% and ADR up 6% year-over-year, this being our toughest comp versus 2021 given the strong reopening trend we experienced last year. Our gross bookings continue to be robust, with occupancy growth in all future months this year and rate up double digits versus 2021 in each month. In fact, during June, we booked the most rooms per day so far this year. Yes, we really like the demand outlook for Las Vegas.\nOur second quarter regional net revenues were $960 million, an increase of 12% versus the second quarter of 2021. We delivered regional adjusted property EBITDAR of $340 million, which was 7% above the second quarter of 2021. Margins were 35%, down approximately 200 basis points compared to last year as we brought back more of our non-gaming operations.\nMoving to Macau. Net revenues of $143 million in the second quarter represented a 54% decrease compared to the second quarter last year. Adjusted property EBITDAR was a loss of $52 million in the second quarter versus positive $9 million last year. Public health policies remain a headwind in the region as entrance into Macau has been severely limited.\nTurning to BetMGM. Our 50% share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter was $71 million, which is reported as a part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation, and we expect to contribute $225 million to BetMGM this year. Now in the first half of 2022, BetMGM generated net revenues associated with operations of $608 million which is an improvement of 70% compared to the first half of 2021 and well on track to meet our forecast of $1.3 billion.\nOur second quarter corporate expense, including share-based compensation, was $120 million, which included $21 million of transaction costs. We're strategically investing our corporate expense in growth areas, including improvements to our IT infrastructure, enhanced digital offerings for our guests and, of course, our IR efforts in Japan.\nSo before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to restate our capital allocation strategy and touch briefly on how we view the valuation of our company. Our strategy is as follows. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Second, we'll invest where we have clear advantages, exercising prudence and measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. And finally, we'll return cash to [those] shareholders. The transactions we've completed and announced this quarter yet again demonstrate our commitment to and execution of these priorities. We bolstered our liquidity through the closing of the VICI transaction. We improved our portfolio with the acquisition of the Cosmopolitan and the announced sale of the operations of the Mirage and Gold Strike Tunica. We invested in our international digital future with the announced LeoVegas transaction.\nWe returned cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 32.4 million shares for $1.1 billion. Since the beginning of 2021 through last night, we've repurchased 104 million shares for $4 billion or 31% of our market cap. This activity brings our share count down to approximately 393 million shares. We've been aggressively repurchasing our shares over the past 18 months because of the value we see at current trading multiples.\nHere's how I think about it. As of yesterday, our share price was $33 and we had 393 million shares outstanding. So this implies a market cap of $13 billion. If we add our quarter end domestic net debt and subtract the value of our 56% stake in MGM China, then we have the enterprise value of our domestic operations. Divide this by the trailing 12-months EBITDA adjusted for corporate expense, Cosmopolitan, Mirage and Gold Strike transactions, and this implies a trailing multiple of 5.3x with our stake in BetMGM for free. These deals were announced a few months ago, but our sales of the Mirage and Gold Strike traded at trailing EBITDA multiples of 17x and 11x, respectively.\nBut wait, there's more. Our traditional debt is all fixed rate, and our lease agreements escalate by only 2% annually for the first 10 years, and thereafter, we have a CPI cap of 3%. So we enjoy free cash flow operating leverage by driving EBITDAR growth above 2% or 3%. In the second quarter, our domestic same-store adjusted EBITDAR grew by 33%.\nBill, back to you.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan.\nI know my new Chief Sales Officer is going to come [from]. As a company, we've been busy this year in our pursuit of our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company. I could not be more proud of the progress we've made, but understand there is clearly more work to do.\nAgain, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their contribution to everything we have accomplished. There is a lot of excitement in the rest of '22 and beyond. I can't wait for what's to come. I truly believe our best days are yet to come.\nAnd with that, operator, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Hubert Wang, President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM China; and Andrew Chapman, Director of Investor Relations. (Operator Instructions)\nAfter the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Chapman. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Chapman\n\nDirector of IR, MGM Resorts International\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com. We've also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.\nOn this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or otherwise.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin today's call by once again thanking our employees at MGM Resorts for their determination, agility, perseverance and commitment to assets that helped fuel another strong quarter for our company. We were challenged in January by the Omicron variant, but pivoted quickly into recovery mode, leading to multiple all-time EBITDAR record at several of our Las Vegas and regional properties in March. These results showcased the strength of our talented team across the country, our focus on operational efficiency and the continued strong demand for the service and experience we provide at MGM Resorts.\nToday, I want to acknowledge and thank our employees, again, for all that they do every day to take care of our guests and each other. As a company, we remain laser focused on our strategic plan and our long-term vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company. As a reminder, our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and our planet; providing unique experiences to our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities; delivering operational excellence at every level; and allocating our capital responsibly to yield the highest return for our shareholders.\nOver the last several quarters, we've discussed the meaningful steps we've taken to simplify our corporate structure and monetize the real estate assets to meaningfully bolster our domestic cash condition. We reached another important milestone in this journey, Friday, April 29, when we closed the strategic transaction with MGM Growth Properties and VICI. I'd like to thank James Stewart, Andy Chan and the Board and employees of MGP for all their support and for the great relationship we have built over the years.\nOur transaction with VICI allowed us to fully deconsolidate MGP from our financial reporting and also netted us approximately $4.4 billion in cash, which we will use to invest in our core business will also continue to assume meaningful growth opportunities. One such opportunity is our announcement today of the tender for LeoVegas, our success with BetMGM in the United States gives us more conviction than ever about the potential for digital gaming and our ability to grow share in the exciting new marketplace. And with this conviction, we are expanding internationally with the team at LeoVegas. Its strong technology platform and pipeline for growth present a compelling opportunity for our business to grow online.\nWe'd like to thank the management team at LeoVegas for their professionalism and support throughout the process, and we look forward to working with that team when the deal closes in the second half of this year.\nAnother opportunity that we're quite excited about is the pursuit of a commercial gaming license in New York. The recently enacted fiscal year '23 budget includes provisions that will allow the issuance of up to 3 new licenses in the state. We'd like to thank Governor Hochul, New York legislature for getting this important issue across the finish line. We're eager to begin the RFA process and share our vision for the future of the property in Yonkers, where if we receive a license, we plan to replace the existing VLTs with slot machines and add table games to our existing casino floor and construct new amenities on portions of our 97-acre site. Again, we're excited by this opportunity and look forward to investing this discipline in the New York to create new jobs and foster economic growth in the region.\nTurning to our Las Vegas growth strategy, we made solid progress towards our acquisition of operations of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and are on track to close this quarter. The Cosmopolitan is an iconic brand with a loyal and complementary customer base that will further enhance our Las Vegas Strip portfolio. We've met with key leaders at the Cosmopolitan over the last weeks and months, and are impressed by the quality of their team as well as the culture and the brand that they have built. We look forward to welcoming all the CoStars at the Cosmopolitan and MGM Resorts and adding this existing portfolio -- of property, excuse me, to our portfolio.\nWe've also made progress on the sale of the operations of the Mirage to Hard Rock International, which we announced last year. We are working closely with regulators to ensure a smooth transition and expect this transaction to close in the second half of this year.\nShifting to our international growth strategy. Last week, we submitted our area development plan to the government of Japan with our partners at ORIX and the City of Osaka. This is the final milestone before a license decision will be made hopefully in October of this year. We continue to work closely with the national government to obtain a license that will be hopefully awarded later this year and bring a fully integrated resort into Japan.\nIn the UAE, we continue to make progress in beginning the MGM brand family to Dubai, where we have a management agreement for an integrated resort being developed in partnership with Wasl. The project has broken ground in a development process, and we remain diligent for opportunities to bring the MGM brand to other locales around the world.\nTurning to BetMGM, we are now live in 23 markets with New York, Illinois, Louisiana and Puerto Rico coming online in the first quarter and Ontario launching in early April. In February, BetMGM committed 24% market share in active markets in both U.S. sports betting and iGaming, which puts us in the #1 position nationwide. BetMGM is the clear leader in iGaming, having reached 28% market share in February. The BetMGM management team will be able to provide more color on results and the strategy at their investor meeting on Thursday, May 12.\nFinally, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our organic growth strategy. On February 1, we relaunched our loyalty program as MGM Rewards with a goal to target high-value non-gaming customers in addition to gaming customers, increase cross-property patronage and tier progression, while motivating benefits and further activate BetMGM customers at our properties. We've seen solid results since the launch of MGM Rewards in Q1, particularly as it relates to our omnichannel growth strategy with BetMGM. In the first quarter, 57% of our MGM Rewards enrollments came via BetMGM driven by the Super Bowl compared to 39% for the full year in '21. We've committed to our strategy of building loyalty between our different channels and ultimately creating a seamless experience for our customers to play both online and in person.\nBefore I turn this over to Jonathan, I'd like to hit a few highlights of our current trends and our future outlook. In Las Vegas, we maintained strong margins in the first quarter, a reflection of the sustainable operating learnings implemented from the pandemic. Strong weekend occupancies and ADR were driven by a robust event calendar, and we see that trend continuing into the second quarter. For the midweek, our occupancy is still behind '19, but an improving mix of business and a growing group base will allow us to ramp in the remainder of the year. We continue to expect our convention room nights to reach 90% of 2019 levels in the back half of 2022.\nImportantly, we are seeing increased spend levels for our groups year-to-date, including catering and banquets, and to spotlight, our international leisure trends were beginning to see positive indicators of the return of international flight capacity. In fact, by this summer, the LVCVA expects international flight capacity to return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels.\nFurther highlight events in Las Vegas, we were honored to host the Grammys at MGM Grand Garden. We welcomed the BTS army to our properties for 4 sold-out shows at Allegiant Stadium. This past weekend, we also hosted the NFL Draft, which activated the entire Las Vegas Strip. We also have big sporting events coming with the NCAA Men's Basketball Regionals on tap for March of next year, along with the first of a kind Formula 1 Race in the Las Vegas Strip in November of '23. And of course, we will host the Super Bowl in February of '24. All of these big events show the incredible progress the City has made as an entertainment and sports destination.\nLooking to our regional properties, we had a very strong first quarter with competitive margins to 2021 and we are focused on driving strong rated gaming revenues by yielding our database with the highest value players. Finally, I want to touch briefly on our operations in Macau. We continue to see headwinds in the short term with public health policies impacting the ability for customers to enter Macau.\nDespite this, our 13% market share is higher than we have seen historically, and our properties are well positioned to capture premium mass business as volumes begin to return. Concession renewal process is underway, and we remain confident in the government's judicious and fair approach to this process. Macau is an important part of our future, and we will continue to work with the government to ultimately get our license renewed. We look forward to further promoting the long-term development of Macau's gaming industry and supporting the government's tourism and diversification goals for the region.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to discuss the details of the quarter.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nCFO & Treasurer, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks very much, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Bill's words by thanking the entire MGM Resorts team for their professionalism and resiliency in the face of an ever-changing operating environment. I'd also like to thank the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas team for their support as we plan for closing, and I look forward to welcoming the CoStars into the MGM Resorts family this quarter.\nNow let's spend a few minutes on our first quarter results in some detail. Our consolidated first quarter net revenues were $2.9 billion, and our net loss attributable to MGM Resorts was $18 million, a significant improvement when compared to net revenues of $1.6 billion and a net loss of $332 million in the first quarter of 2021.\nOur first quarter Las Vegas Strip net revenues were $1.7 billion, and adjusted property EBITDAR for the strip was $594 million. Net revenues were down 1% on a same-store basis due to 343,000 fewer occupied rooms, nearly all in January. However, same-store adjusted property EBITDAR of $472 million was up 21% versus the first quarter of 2019, demonstrating our broad-based margin improvement.\nFirst quarter occupancy was 78%, but it was a different story each month of the quarter. The Omicron impact was significant in January, during which occupancy was 65%. We recovered to an occupancy of 78% in February and finished the quarter with occupancy of 90% in March. The strength continued into April, where we saw an occupancy of 92% on the strip.\nDespite the pandemic impact, ADR in the first quarter was $197 or $184 on a same-store basis, which was $1 above the first quarter of 2019. And same-store excludes ARIA and Vdara in 2022. Again, a different story each month for ADR. ADR had a similar cadence as occupancy, down 11% versus the first quarter of '19 in January, then up 4% in February and up 9% in March, driven by strong weekend demand. Simultaneous increases in volume and pricing improved our financial performance dramatically as we went through the quarter.\nLas Vegas strip margins were 36% for the quarter and 35% on a same-store basis, an improvement of over 600 basis points versus 2019 on a same-store basis. We have the blueprint in place to sustain margins well above 2019 levels through our cost efficiency efforts and operating leverage. As Bill mentioned, together with robust group demand, there is exciting programming in the second quarter that will drive increased leisure business in Las Vegas and support occupancies in the low 90s.\nOur first quarter regional net revenues were $891 million, an increase of 11% versus the first quarter of 2019. We delivered regional adjusted property EBITDAR of $313 million, which was 48% above 2019. Our regional casino business was quite strong despite the typical seasonality in the business during the first quarter. Our casino revenues improved 23% versus the first quarter of 2019. Our first quarter regional margin of 35% grew 882 basis points versus 2019. The promotional expenses in the regional markets are stable and a few points below 2019 levels. Room nights were down in the first quarter due in part to staffing challenges, but that situation is improving nicely this quarter.\nMoving to Macau. Net revenues of $268 million in the first quarter represents a 9% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted property EBITDAR was a loss of $26 million in the first quarter versus a positive $5 million in the prior year quarter. Now, the current quarter also included a charge of $18 million related to litigation reserves. We're confident in Macau that our product offering -- in our product offering, and we believe that once demand returns, we're very well positioned to grow, particularly in our premium mass and mass segments.\nTurning to BetMGM. Our 50% of BetMGM's losses in the first quarter amounted to $92 million, which is reported as part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation. This was driven largely by the initial investment in New York, but we expect these losses to narrow in the upcoming quarters. The growth story for BetMGM is a key pillar in our long-term strategic plan. Connecting BetMGM with MGM Rewards allows us to develop a strong omni-channel link with our customers that will optimize our guest experience, both online and in person.\nOur first quarter corporate expense, including share-based compensation, was $111 million, which included $9 million of transaction costs. We're strategically investing our corporate expense in growth areas, including improvements to our IT infrastructure, enhancing our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan.\nAnd before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I would like once again to reiterate our approach to capital allocation. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll invest where we have clear advantages exercising prudence and measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. And finally, we'll return cash to shareholders.\nAnd I think our actions thus far this year amply demonstrate our priorities in allocating capital. We have the closure on Friday of our strategic transactions with VICI and realized $4.4 billion in proceeds for MGM, bolstering our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet. This quarter, we announced or will close 2 strategic growth investments to augment our digital and Las Vegas market position, LeoVegas and The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.\nFinally, during the first quarter, we repurchased 23.3 million shares for $1 billion. In April, we repurchased another 6.2 million shares. So since the beginning of 2021, we've repurchased 72.7 million shares for approximately $3 billion or 19% of our market capitalization. This activity brings our share count down to about 425 million shares.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. We've made solid progress in the company coming out of the pandemic, and our operating model is the strongest that it's ever been. I'd like to again thank all of our team members for their commitment and dedication to MGM Resorts. We would not be in the position we are today without all of their hard work.\nObviously, we are looking forward to the rest of '22 and beyond with confidence and feel our best days are yet to come. With that, operator, I'll turn it over and take questions."

Joining the call from the company today are: Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer; Hubert Wang, President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM China; and Sarah Rogers, SVP of Corporate Finance. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Sarah.\n\nSarah Rogers\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThank you, Sarah, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a very strong end to a great year, producing our highest consolidated adjusted EBITDAR quarter ever in the history of the company. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts delivered yet another all-time quarterly EBITDA record, and our regional delivered a fourth quarter EBITDA record. Our Strip and regional margins also remained very strong in the fourth quarter. These results are testament to a very talented team across the country, our sharpened focus on operational efficiency and the proven resiliency of demand for the services and experiences that we provide at MGM Resorts despite the overhang of COVID.\nOur employees remain the cornerstone of our organization, and I am so appreciative of their dedication to our company and our guests. We could not have achieved these phenomenal results without our world-class team members. We know it has not been the easiest of journeys over the last couple of years, but I cannot say thank you enough and how grateful I am for everyone in the MGM family. Simply, thank you.\nOur strong employee base and our leadership team also propelled us forward to advance our strategic plan and long-term vision to simply be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company. As a reminder, our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing in our people and planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating our capital responsibly to yield the highest return for our shareholders.\nI briefly touched on the great results we delivered in the fourth quarter, and Jonathan will go into more detail in his remarks. For now, I'd like to spend some time highlighting the significant milestones we achieved in '21 to transform our company. First, we took steps to complete our goal of monetizing our real estate assets meaningfully bolstering our domestic cash position. We have simplified our structure, bringing the operations of City Center fully under our control, selling MGP to VICI, a transaction that is expected to close in the coming months.\nWe are also making strategic changes in our Las Vegas portfolio with the announced acquisition of the operations of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and the sale of the operations of the Mirage. We believe these transactions will enhance and diversify our offerings in one of the most desirable and competitive destinations in the world.\nAt MGM, our joint venture with Entain has established a strong brand and leaders in position with the U.S. sports betting and iGaming space, finishing 2021 as the #1 operator in iGaming, and the #2 player in overall sports and iGaming. I am incredibly pleased with BetMGM's excellent execution to date. We have substantial progress in Japan where the City of Osaka chose us as their partner to build and operate a new world-class integrated resort. Doing so will allow us to continue to diversify geographically into what we believe will be one of the world's largest gaming markets in the world.\nWe also returned meaningful cash to our shareholders. And finally, we bolstered our executive team last year with the addition of Jonathan and Tilak Mandadi, who recently joined us from Disney. They both have already been vital to the execution of our long-term goals.\nWe are pleased with all that we've accomplished in '21, and we're even more excited how this sets us up for strong momentum into 2022. Starting with BetMGM, we remain confident in the team's ability to sustain and advance its leadership position in both new and existing states. And evidenced by this comments, both owners anticipate collectively investing another $450 million BetMGM this year. You heard from Adam and Gary on their recent call, and we'll hear more from the BetMGM team during their Investor Day in May.\nIn terms of new expansion opportunities, we are working with our partners, Orix, in the city of Osaka to submit an area development plan to the central government by April. We remain hopeful and confident in being awarded a license later this year to build an integrated resort in Japan.\nStateside, we're encouraged by the continued progress being made in the commercial gaming license opportunity in New York, which could be awarded as early as this year. We believe MGM is extremely well positioned given our existing operations in Empire City.\nAnd finally, as we think about organic growth in our business, we see an opportunity to deepen loyalty and garner incremental revenue share by maximizing the full potential of our network of premium resort properties and entertainment venues across the U.S. We are addressing this opportunity through a fully coordinated company-wide effort, which leverages our strategic investments in advanced analytics, data and technology. Our goal is to identify and efficiently acquire high-value gaming and non-gaming customers by optimizing our target marketing, improving on-property service and improving new experiences for those guests throughout their visit.\nWe view our loyalty program as an integral part of this effort to acquire, to engage and to retain high-value customers. On February 1, we announced the enhancement and the rebranding of our customer loyalty program from M Life to MGM Rewards. Not only does the name better align with our business, but the updated program allows us to address key opportunities, including targeting high-value non-gaming customers in addition to high-volume gaming customers incentivizing cross-property patronage and tier progression with more motivating benefits, and further activating BetMGM's customers in our properties. In 2021, approximately 42% of our new database enrollments came from BetMGM. We envision that this rapidly growing group of omnichannel customers will be able to reverse seamlessly between our online and offline offerings over time, experiencing MGM Resorts benefits proportionate to their tier status.\nMGM Rewards is the first of several steps in organic growth journey to attract and retain more high-value gaming, digital gaming and nongaming customers. Over the next several years, we'll be investing over $2 billion into our properties, creating customer-centric experiences and services in addition to the needed technology platform and advanced analytics to better engage and service our guests and drive market share in our principal markets.\nBefore I turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, I'd like to make some high-level comments on our current trends and the future outlook. As you all know, the emergence of Omicron variant in November led to rapid rise in COVID cases. Fortunately, this didn't put a damper on the year-end and plans we had -- and had a great December. However, January, which typically relies more heavily on group business in Las Vegas saw significant headwinds driven by groups mostly looking to postpone until later in the year. Cancellations while elevated, were mostly concentrated in a very short term with limited impact beyond March. CES in January was the most visible event this year with attendance down approximately 70%.\nDespite the tougher January, we're happy to see COVID cases again on the downswing across the broader U.S. Cancellations are declining and group lead volumes are normalizing. Forward hotel book has been stable over the past few weeks and are once again starting to outpace 2019 levels. I expect that given positive COVID trends in Nevada, we will start to see meaningful loosening of COVID restrictions in the very, very near future, consistent with what we have seen in other states.\nFurthermore, our weekends have remained very strong. In fact, this past weekend, the city had the East West Shine Ball, the NHL All-Star game at T-Mobile Arena, the NFL Probo-Alleged Stadium, Garth Brooks at Dolby Live at Park MGM and a pay-per-view fight in the Michelob Ultra arena at Mandalay. Our strip hotels ran 91% on Friday and 98% on Saturday. This upcoming weekend, we expect a very strong Super Bowl turnout, and we look further -- and as we look further out for the first time ever, the Grammys are coming to Las Vegas in April, and we're hosting this iconic event at the MGM Grand. Las Vegas is also serving as the host of the NFL draft in a couple of months' time. These types of wins continue to demonstrate that the city with MGM Resorts at its epicenter, remains a resilient and leading destination for exceptional of entertainment and now most notably, sports.\nTurning to our regional properties. We delivered an all-time record EBITDA year in 2021, with most of our properties leading in GGR shared with their respective markets. Our regional success continues to be driven by our premium offerings as well as strength in our rated gaming spend levels, combined with our efforts to yield to our higher-worth customers. We are reopening nongaming amenities at a measured pace as demand and resources allow, and our teams remain focused on labor productivity, giving us confidence in our ability to sustain margins above 2019 levels longer term.\nI will conclude with some comments on Macau. Despite the continued choppiness in the operating environment driven by various travel restrictions and structural shifts in the high end, MGM China reached an all-time record 14% in market share. The official launch of the Emerald Suites at MGM Cotai during the quarter enhanced their hospitality offering and is helping us also grow share. We believe MGM China remains well positioned for the market's eventual rebound given its strengths in premium mass.\nImportantly, recent constructive developments around the concession renewals, reaffirm our confidence in the government's judicious and fair approach to the process. Macau is an important part of our future and we will continue to work with the government to ultimately get our license renewed. We look forward to further promoting the long-term development of Macau's gaming industry and supporting the government's tourism and diversification goals for the region.\nAs many of you know, this is Cathy Park's last earnings call with us. I cannot thank Cathy enough for all that she has done for the company and wish her all of her very best. Although I will note today, it's 69 degrees in Las Vegas, and it's not so in Boston.\nJonathan, with that, it's yours.\n\nJonathan S. Halkyard\n\nCFO & Treasurer, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks a lot, Bill. I'd like to join Bill and deep gratitude for our entire team here at MGM. Your heroic efforts have allowed us to deliver another quarter of outstanding results. And I look forward to working with you to continue this success in 2022.\nNow let's discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail. Our consolidated fourth quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, a 13% sequential improvement over our third quarter results. Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $131 million, and our adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially to $821 million, led once again by our domestic operations.\n16 of our 17 domestic properties achieved either all-time or fourth quarter EBITDA records. And 14 achieved either all-time or fourth quarter margin records. This performance reflects strong broad-based demand across all segments, even into the latter part of the quarter, which is typically our seasonal low period. We also demonstrated our ability to improve our operations while maintaining cost discipline against the backdrop of workforce and supply chain challenges.\nOur fourth quarter Las Vegas Strip net revenues, which now fully includes City Center, were 26% above the fourth quarter of 2019 at $1.8 billion. Adjusted property EBITDAR for the Strip was $699 million, 84% above the fourth quarter of 2019. Hold had a positive $8.5 million impact on our EBITDA this quarter in Las Vegas. So Hold adjusted Strip EBITDAR was $690 million. Our Strip margins were 39% in the fourth quarter, a 1,200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 and equal to our margins in the third quarter of 2021.\nWe continue to drive healthy casino performance in the fourth quarter with Strip, slot handle and table games drop increasing 31% and 17% above the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively. Now that's when including Aria and excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas in both periods. Our fourth quarter casino revenues grew 66% over the fourth quarter 2019 or 40% when including Aria and excluding Circus in both periods. Notably, for the first time since the pandemic began, our rated 65-and-over age demographic in Las Vegas reached its pre-pandemic levels in terms of room nights in the fourth quarter.\nOur Strip hotel occupancy was 86% in the fourth quarter, improving sequentially from 82% in the third quarter. This was driven by strong weekdays anchored by our best convention quarter since the pandemic began and even stronger weekends. Our ADRs in the fourth quarter were 19% above that of fourth quarter 2019 or 7% above on a same-store basis.\nNow Bill will discuss the current operating dynamics, which have been challenging and also why we continue to be optimistic about our business beyond the first quarter. To help provide a sense of the magnitude of the impact presently, we just finished January with Las Vegas Strip occupancy at 66%. But we expect the rest of the first quarter to improve with February occupancy running in the mid-70s and March in the mid-80s. February and March ADRs are pacing near 2019 levels, fueled by weekend ADRs up over 20%. And while we had occupancy drop last month, January was our highest booking month since March of 2021, and it was better than any single month in 2019. These are rooms that were booked in January for the future. Yes, we all feel pretty good about the outlook here in Las Vegas.\nOur fourth quarter regional net revenues were $900 million and flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $309 million, which was 36% above 2019 levels. Combined with our Las Vegas results, our domestic businesses delivered over $1 billion of EBITDAR in the quarter.\nOur fourth quarter regional margins grew 900 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019 to 34%. Recall that our third quarter margins grew by a similar 886 basis points over the third quarter of 2019. Our regional casino business remains strong despite the typical seasonality in the business during the fourth quarter. Our slots and table games volumes improved by 7% and 5%, respectively, over the fourth quarter in 2019, and our net PO per day for our rated customers increased 34% over the same quarter in 2019, led by our high-value $400 segment.\nI'd like to make some comments about our cost structure and how it has evolved over time. Our Las Vegas and regional EBITDAR margins have remained very strong throughout the last year. And while they benefited from pent-up consumer demand and elevated casino spend, they also evidence the great work that our teams have put into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This ranges from labor productivity to optimizing F&B offerings to strategic player reinvestment. And as we continue to staff our teams to more sustainable levels and our nongaming revenues increasingly become larger contributors to our overall business, we expect our domestic margins to stabilize still well above 2019 levels.\nMoving to BetMGM. We're currently live in 21 markets, having launched in both New York and Louisiana in January as well as Puerto Rico today. The team remains busy, that's probably the understatement of the call, with expectations to go live in Illinois next month as well as Canada later this year. Adam and Gary from BetMGM provided a business update back on January 19, and during which they announced having delivered net revenue from operations of $850 million in 2021, growing nearly 5x over 2020. We expect the momentum to continue into 2022 with BetMGM expecting to deliver net revenue from operations of over $1.3 billion.\nOur 50% share of BetMGM's losses in the fourth quarter amounted to $57 million, which is reported as a part of the unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDAR calculation. This brings our share of BetMGM's losses to $211 million for the full year 2021. And as Bill alluded to earlier, we continue to believe that BetMGM is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and one that will generate meaningful returns on our investment.\nFinally, in Macau, overall market-wide gross gaming revenues in the fourth quarter grew 2% sequentially from the third quarter. MGM China's net revenue grew 9% sequentially to $315 million and adjusted property EBITDAR slightly declined sequentially to $5 million, partially driven by VIP hold and higher bad debt.\nTravel restrictions are still the greatest bottlenecks to a more meaningful recovery in the region, but we remain encouraged by the clear signs of demand for our offerings. In fact, for the recently ended Chinese New Year holiday period, total visitor counts to our properties were up 30% over the prior year, with our mass segment showing healthy year-over-year growth and recovery.\nFourth quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $117 million, which included about $8 million of transaction costs. We incurred some additional expenses related to our loyalty program relaunch and true-ups for performance-related compensation. And as a result, we expect that our net corporate expense in the fourth quarter will run lower -- for the first quarter will run lower than in the fourth quarter.\nUnfortunately, one of the most important topics facing our company today is the allocation of our capital. And we believe that among the most productive uses of that capital is returning it to our shareholders. At current trading levels, we believe there's tremendous value in the shares, and we've acted on that conviction. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 17 million shares for $727 million. And so far this quarter, we've repurchased roughly 8.5 million shares for $370 million. Since we started the program last March, not even 1 year ago, we have repurchased over 52 million shares for just over $2.1 billion. That's over 10.5% of our market cap. These repurchases have been funded in part by a series of transformational transactions announced over the last year. Transactions that improve our portfolio, simplify our structure, bolster our liquidity position and advance our vision to be the world's premier gaming entertainment company. This year, we are working to bring these deals across the finish line.\nOur transaction with VICI remains on track to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. We also expect to close our acquisition of the operations of the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. In December, we announced our agreement to sell the operations of the Mirage to Hard Rock for $1.075 billion representing a 17x multiple on its 2019 adjusted EBITDAR less rent. And we expect this transaction to close in the second half of the year.\nWe remain highly liquid. As of December 31, our cash position, excluding MGM China and MGP was $4.8 billion or $7.4 billion when adjusted for the VICI, the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas and the Mirage transactions, as well as the retirement of our $1 billion senior notes coming due next month.\nOur approach to capital allocation continues to be as follows: first, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity; second, we'll return cash to our shareholders; and then finally, when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages and we'll exercise prudence in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders.\nAnd then before I turn it over -- back over to Bill, I'd just like to address my final comments to our organic growth plan, starting with our new MGM Rewards loyalty program. Today in Las Vegas, we attribute over 80% of our gaming revenue to specific customers enrolled in MGM Rewards, enabling the delivery of personalized service and relevant offers. But when it comes to hotel dining and entertainment spending, that percentage that is attributable to specific customers is less than 40%.\nFor MGM, these nongaming revenues amount to approximately $5 billion per year in Las Vegas alone. And I think we'd all agree that MGM has the best, most diverse hotel dining and entertainment experiences in Las Vegas. This is a huge opportunity for us. Expanding the ways our customers earn rewards, simplifying the benefits that they receive in return provides compelling reasons for guests to share their journeys with us. As our understanding grows, it will enhance our ability to provide a more compelling, personalized experience and offers for our guests. As a result, we believe will drive deeper loyalty and grow our customer base over time, delivering financial gain for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hornbuckle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, MGM Resorts International\n\nThanks, Jonathan. Jonathan, by the way, just celebrated his first years anniversary. I wonder what he's been doing. When I first spoke with all of you as the CEO approximately 2 years ago, I expressed my desire to be focused, disciplined and transparent in how we run this company. I believe these virtues have served us well over the last couple of years, and I believe they will continue to serve us well into the future as we look to drive long-term shareholder value.\nI'd like to close by thanking again all of our employees for their service, for their commitment and their dedication to this company. Together, we've accomplished a lot in the past year, and I'm excited about what we can further do and accomplish this year and beyond.\nWith that, Chad, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

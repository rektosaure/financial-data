Instead, we're working to shift suppliers to lower political risk countries or develop domestic sources.

As a result, we are potentially overpaying duties. Unsure of potential drawbacks. Implementation of tariffs and their application is sudden and abrupt. The business is taking countermeasures.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

Supplier relationships are strained by pain-share negotiations, and competitors are gaining share by importing from lower-tariff regions.\" [Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products]",
      "\"Tariff whiplash is causing us major issues with customers. The two issues we are seeing: (1) customers are holding back orders to understand what is happening with tariffs on their products or (2) they are forcing us to accept the tariffs, which causes us to 'no quote' the job as we cannot take on that type of risk for an order.\" [Machinery]",

      "\"Tariff trade wars are incredibly volatile, quickly changing, and disrupting a ton of our current work. We are 90 percent sourced out of China , and the cost models keep changing every week. We are flying to visit suppliers in a few weeks to negotiate current terms and pricing, as well as develop more long-term, strategic plans to reduce risk in the region.\" [Apparel, Leather & Allied Products]",
      "\"Demand is slightly lower than plan, but it has been steady amid tariff concerns. Significant time has been spent quantifying the impact of changing tariff rates. Our costs will increase, and we are discussing how to share that impact across suppliers and customers.\" [Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components]",
      "\"The recently imposed 145-percent tariff rate on Chinese imports is significantly affecting our 2025 profitability.

      "\"In the evolving supply chain environment, customers are increasingly taking an active role in initiating new projects, looking for cost reduction opportunities and lead-time mitigation, with a growing emphasis on collaboration. Post-pandemic, customers have learned they need partners to navigate rough waters.\" [Computer & Electronic Products]",
      "\"We need to coordinate very closely with suppliers in order to yield a more cost-competitive offer. More back and forth is needed to reach a reasonable total price.\" [Chemical Products]",
      "\"Orders and production remain steady, and we are maintaining a healthy backlog. Continued inflation and wage adjustments continue to drive prices up, although we should get some relief from the markets stabilizing.\" [Transportation Equipment]",
      "\"Cost increases are now generally isolated to specific commodities rather than blanket increases due to 'inflation.' \" [Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products]",
      "\"Markets remain soft. Our customers have about-right inventory levels, but they paid more due to pandemic cost increases. Everyone is holding off on increasing inventories, hoping they can buy at lower costs.\" [Apparel, Leather & Allied Products]",
      "\"Overall, things continue to be very steady: Sales and revenue are as expected, and the supply environment has stabilized greatly versus 2021-22. Some things to watch include the Panama Canal (drought), U.S.- China relations, and the impact the UAW (United Auto Workers) strike could have on suppliers of ours who support automotive production. But overall conditions feel stable.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",
      "\"Cement negotiations have changed, with cement mills no longer offering annual or guaranteed pricing. We now want to contract more as a commodity, leaning toward quarterly, with fluctuating prices yet to be determined.\" [Nonmetallic Mineral Products]",
      "\"A recession feels imminent. Money continues to be pushed into the bank markets, driving inflation rates really high. Most plants are buying less material or reducing consumption in the name of sustainability, as well as running at 80 percent of capacity. Prices of some products may increase for the upcoming winter weather.\" [Petroleum & Coal Products]",
      "\"Business conditions and market demand remain strong. We are projected to be at capacity in the next 12 months.\" [Primary Metals]",
      "\"New business development is coming onboard. However, many forecasts are set for the beginning of 2024. Hiring and retaining quality people is still a struggle.\" [Textile Mills]",

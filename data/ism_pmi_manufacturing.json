      "“Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are cancelling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape.” (Chemical Products)",
      "“Decrease in domestic demand for finished products has resulted in slower manufacturing and an increase of raw material in inventory.” (Petroleum & Coal Products)",
      "“In general, business is really strained. Money is sitting tighter, and geopolitical changes add to the uncertainty/risk factor. Even medical fields are feeling the pressure.” (Miscellaneous Manufacturing)",
      "“Sales continue to underperform in our automotive OEM and industrial divisions. Our aerospace and automotive aftermarket are the only areas performing slightly above budget. This is the third month of lower-than-expected sales, and the remainder of the year outlook is not looking better. Sales are expected to be slightly less than in 2024.” (Fabricated Metal Products)",
      "“Tariffs continue to be a large impact to our business. The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful. Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly. We are trying to keep up with the wild fluctuations and pass along what costs we can to our customers.” (Machinery)",
      "“The commercial vehicle (CV) market remains depressed as customers continue to delay vehicle purchases. Uncertainty in price and transportation demand remains the center of attention. U.S. trade policy and reciprocal actions by China in the form of export controls on rare earths and semiconductors, as well as ocean freight carrier restrictions, have once again caused a lot of stress in supply lines. The CV industry is now bracing for the next round of tariffs focused on commercials vehicles, scheduled to begin on November 1.” (Transportation Equipment)",
      "“The tariff trade war has negatively impacted agricultural export markets, driving down demand and price. This negatively impacts farmer revenue and the likelihood of farmers investing in new equipment.” (Machinery)",
      "“The unpredictability of the tariff situation continues to cause havoc and uncertainty on future pricing/cost. But even with the tariffs, the cost to import in many cases is still more attractive than sourcing within the U.S. Challenges with tariffs on production equipment necessary for internal production makes it difficult to justify expansion of capacity.” (Computer & Electronic Products)",
      "“Volatility in some of our highly exposed commodity markets has tempered a bit, thanks to improved weather conditions and overall downward pressure on pricing. Tariffs continue to remain difficult to quantify, manage and deal with in general, since they continue to impact us day-to-day and our bottom line.” (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)",
      "“Wonder has turned to concern regarding how the tariff threats are affecting our business. Orders are down across most divisions, and we’ve lowered our financial expectations for 2025.” (Chemical Products)"

      "\"Fairly flat quarter over quarter, but with us being in the safety and security sector (and with U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a customer), the recent bill that passed should result in an increase in business in the coming months.\" [Computer & Electronic Products]",
      "\"Sales continue at unprecedented growth, driven by data-center construction. Customers and the sales team continue to demand lower pricing, which drives down gross margins in face of input price increases, primarily from aluminum imports.\" [Chemical Products]",
      "\"These tariff wars are beginning to wear us out. It's been very difficult to forecast what we will pay in duties and calculate any cost savings we've had this year. Also, tariffs have disrupted our customs import bond. There is zero clarity about the future, and it's been a difficult few months trying to figure out where everything is going to land and the impact on our business. So far, tremendous and unexpected costs have been incurred.\" [Apparel, Leather & Allied Products]",
      "\"Currently, higher interest rates still depress the construction industry for new construction projects. Tariff policies are uncertain, which slows down (1) our investment in new projects, (2) component sourcing for new products, (3) blanket orders and (4) replenishment of large inventory quantities. Instead, we're working to shift suppliers to lower political risk countries or develop domestic sources. We are impacted by the higher tariffs on costs of raw materials and components both sourced domestically and from overseas, and we expect expenses will be higher in the third and fourth quarters as we consume the inventory received with new and higher tariffs or update costs from domestic sources in the second quarter.\" [Machinery]",
      "\"Sales softening more than usual during the summer. Negotiations with non-U.S. manufacturers are strained as we are reluctant to issue POs for deliveries three or more months into the future with prices that include current tariffs.\" [Fabricated Metal Products]",
      "\"In the health-care world we continue with 'business as normal,' but we are increasingly searching and assessing geopolitical risk mitigation options.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",
      "\"Tariffs are causing complete uncertainty around sourcing strategies. A sit-and-wait game for now.\" [Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components]",
      "\"Sales are about on par with 2024, but nowhere near budget forecast. Tariff concerns seem to be growing as the year progresses.\" [Nonmetallic Mineral Products]",
      "\"Business is steady, with solid bookings and backlog. Still uncertainty about tariffs and associated inflation.\" [Furniture & Related Products]",
      "\"Energy capacity, specifically in the grid operated by PJM Interconnection, continues to be one of the major concerns for business continuity and growth in this region. The procurement of power and rising natural gas prices in this region due to past green energy policies, coupled with future projected allocations for artificial intelligence data centers, adds additional stress to the PJM system.\" [Primary Metals]",
      "\"Cautiously stable. Tariff impacts are still being monitored. Some increases have been implemented while monitoring other products.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

Unfortunately, this is just the beginning unless something drastically changes, but the supply chain implications will grow — depots will not be stocked, less material will be available, and it will take years for domestic production to handle the needs (if companies even want to).\" [Primary Metals]",
      "\"The geopolitical environment remains volatile: (1) ongoing shifts in U.S. tariff policy make it difficult to plan, (2) emerging conflicts in the Middle East could pose long-term commodity risks and (3) China measures on rare earth materials are causing challenges. Overall outlook for our company is positive; it's just extremely hard to make near-term supply plans/strategies or budgets.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",
      "\"The word that best describes the current market outlook is 'uncertainty.' The erratic trade policy with on-again/off-again tariffs has led to price uncertainty for customers, who appear to be prepared to hold off large capital purchases until stability returns. This has resulted in further reductions in customer demand and softening sales for the balance of 2025. Operations has planned additional weeks of downtime at multiple plants to accommodate reduced orders. Next year's forecast is not any better at this point. Additionally, most electric vehicle (EV) projects have been delayed or canceled, resulting in a significant amount of unutilized capital investment. EV technology launches for 2026-28 have been delayed past 2030.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

None of the six largest manufacturing sectors reported increased production. The index recorded its lowest performance since May 2020 , when it registered 34.2 percent. \"Panelists' companies significantly reduced output levels compared to June. New order rates remain weak, and backlog levels continue to decline. Companies continue to avoid investing in inventory due to the current economic uncertainty,\" says Fiore. An index above 52.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.",
    "production": "Employment ISM ® 's Employment Index registered 43.4 percent in July, 5.9 percentage points lower than the June reading of 49.3 percent. The index recorded its lowest level since a reading of 42 percent in June 2020 . \"The index contracted for the second consecutive month after an expansion in May, which broke a seven-month streak of contraction. None of the six big manufacturing sectors expanded employment in July. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. Panelists' comments in July indicated a notable increase in staff reductions compared to June, supported by the approximately 1-to-1.8 ratio of hiring versus head-count reduction comments,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.",
    "employment": "Supplier Deliveries † Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was slower in July, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 52.6 percent, a 2.8-percentage point gain compared to the reading of 49.8 percent reported in June. This is the first month of slower deliveries after four consecutive months of faster deliveries. After a reading of 52.4 percent in September 2022 , the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there until February. Of the six big industries, three (Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported slower supplier deliveries in July. \"Supplier deliveries are slowing as panelists' companies increasingly rely on their suppliers to manage their purchased material inventory, putting more strain on the supply chain,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.",
    "supplier_deliveries": "Inventories The Inventories Index registered 44.5 percent in July, down 0.9 percentage point compared to the reading of 45.4 percent reported in June. \"Manufacturing inventories contracted at a faster rate compared to the previous month. None of the six big industries reported increased manufacturing inventories in July. Continuing demand uncertainty is causing panelists' companies to reduce investment in inventory and remain reliant on suppliers to carry 'on-demand' inventory,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars ).",

Commodity prices continue to be volatile, especially oil, natural gas, aluminum and plastic resins. Steel prices have reached long-term historical lows, supported by declining scrap prices. Twenty-three percent of companies reported higher prices in July, compared to 20 percent in June,\" says Fiore.

For the second consecutive month, the index recorded its lowest reading since November 2023 , when it registered 39.3 percent. None of the six largest manufacturing industries reported expanded order backlogs in July. \"The index remained in contraction in July, as new order rates were insufficient to allow backlogs to grow. After 22 months of backlog contraction, it is believed that order books are now at historically low levels,\" says Fiore.",
    "backlog_of_orders": "New Export Orders † ISM ® 's New Export Orders Index registered 49 percent in July, up 0.2 percentage point from June's reading of 48.8 percent. \"The New Export Orders Index reading indicates that export orders contracted for a second month after expanding in May and contracting in April, with two straight months of expansion before that. As was experienced in June, new export orders remain sluggish as international trading partners continue to struggle with weak economies,\" says Fiore.",

Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, two (Fabricated Metal Products; and Chemical Products) reported increased production. \"Panelists' companies marginally improved output levels compared to April. With new order rates weak and backlog levels sagging to historical lows, maintaining production output without growing intermediate goods and finished goods inventory will be a challenge in June,\" says Fiore.

    ],
    "new_orders": "Production The Production Index registered 63 percent in October, 2 percentage points higher than the September reading of 61 percent, indicating growth for the fifth consecutive month and the fourth consecutive month above 60 percent. \"Five (Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) of the top six industries expanded strongly,\" says Fiore. An index above 51.7 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.",
    "production": "Employment ISM ® 's Employment Index registered 53.2 percent in October, 3.6 percentage points higher than the September reading of 49.6 percent. \"Following 14 consecutive months of contraction, the Employment Index moved back into expansion territory. This marks the sixth consecutive month of improvement since the index's low of 27.5 percent registered in April. Of the six big industry sectors, five (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products) expanded. Continued strong new-order levels and an expanding backlog signify potential employment strength for the balance of the fourth quarter. For the second straight month, survey panelists' comments indicate that significantly more companies are hiring or attempting to hire than those reducing labor forces,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.8 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.",
    "employment": "Supplier Deliveries † The delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was slower in October, as the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 60.5 percent. This is 1.5 percentage points higher than the 59 percent reported in September. \"Suppliers continue to struggle to deliver, with deliveries slowing at a faster rate compared to September. Transportation challenges and continuing challenges in supplier labor markets are still constraining production growth. The Supplier Deliveries Index reflects the difficulties suppliers continue to experience due to COVID-19 impacts amid expanding new orders and production. Supplier constraints are not expected to diminish soon and represent a continuing hurdle to production output and inventories growth,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.",
    "supplier_deliveries": "Inventories The Inventories Index registered 51.9 percent in October, 4.8 percentage points higher than the 47.1 percent reported for September. Inventories grew after three straight months of contraction. \"Inventory growth in light of ongoing supplier constraints indicate that the supply chain is beginning to improve its performance in meeting production demand,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.3 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars ).",
    "inventories": "Prices † The ISM ® Prices Index registered 65.5 percent, an increase of 2.7 percentage points compared the September reading of 62.8 percent, indicating raw materials prices increased for the fifth consecutive month. \"The Prices index achieved its highest level of expansion since October 2018 , when the index registered 71.6 percent. Aluminum, copper, steel, transportation costs, corrugate, food products and plastics all recorded price increases,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.5 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.",
    "customers_inventories": "Prices † The ISM ® Prices Index registered 65.5 percent, an increase of 2.7 percentage points compared the September reading of 62.8 percent, indicating raw materials prices increased for the fifth consecutive month. \"The Prices index achieved its highest level of expansion since October 2018 , when the index registered 71.6 percent. Aluminum, copper, steel, transportation costs, corrugate, food products and plastics all recorded price increases,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.5 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.",
    "prices": "Backlog of Orders † ISM ® 's Backlog of Orders Index registered 55.7 percent in October, a 0.5-percentage point increase compared to the 55.2 percent reported in September, indicating order backlogs expanded for the fourth consecutive month after four straight months of contraction. \"Backlogs expanded at slightly faster rates in October, indicating that new-order intakes were sufficient to fully offset production outputs and maintain an acceptable level of backlog. Four (Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Chemical Products) of the six big industry sectors' backlogs expanded. The index achieved its highest reading since November 2018 (56.4 percent),\" says Fiore.",
    "backlog_of_orders": "New Export Orders † ISM ® 's New Export Orders Index registered 55.7 percent in October, up 1.4 percentage points compared to the September reading of 54.3 percent. \"The New Export Orders Index grew for the fourth consecutive month at a faster rate and reached its highest level since September 2018 (56 percent). With four of the six big industry sectors expanding (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; and Chemical Products), new export orders were a positive factor to the growth in new orders,\" says Fiore.",
    "new_export_orders": "Imports † ISM ® 's Imports Index registered 58.1 percent in October, up 4.1 percentage points compared to the 54 percent reported for September. \"Imports expanded for the fourth consecutive month and at a faster rate, reflecting continued increases in U.S. factory demand. This is the index's highest level in more than two years (a reading of 59 percent in June 2018 ),\" says Fiore.",
    "imports": "† The Supplier Deliveries, Customers' Inventories, Prices, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders and Imports indexes do not meet the accepted criteria for seasonal adjustments."

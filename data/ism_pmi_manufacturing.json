      "“Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are cancelling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape.” (Chemical Products)",
      "“Decrease in domestic demand for finished products has resulted in slower manufacturing and an increase of raw material in inventory.” (Petroleum & Coal Products)",
      "“In general, business is really strained. Money is sitting tighter, and geopolitical changes add to the uncertainty/risk factor. Even medical fields are feeling the pressure.” (Miscellaneous Manufacturing)",
      "“Sales continue to underperform in our automotive OEM and industrial divisions. Our aerospace and automotive aftermarket are the only areas performing slightly above budget. This is the third month of lower-than-expected sales, and the remainder of the year outlook is not looking better. Sales are expected to be slightly less than in 2024.” (Fabricated Metal Products)",
      "“Tariffs continue to be a large impact to our business. The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful. Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly. We are trying to keep up with the wild fluctuations and pass along what costs we can to our customers.” (Machinery)",
      "“The commercial vehicle (CV) market remains depressed as customers continue to delay vehicle purchases. Uncertainty in price and transportation demand remains the center of attention. U.S. trade policy and reciprocal actions by China in the form of export controls on rare earths and semiconductors, as well as ocean freight carrier restrictions, have once again caused a lot of stress in supply lines. The CV industry is now bracing for the next round of tariffs focused on commercials vehicles, scheduled to begin on November 1.” (Transportation Equipment)",
      "“The tariff trade war has negatively impacted agricultural export markets, driving down demand and price. This negatively impacts farmer revenue and the likelihood of farmers investing in new equipment.” (Machinery)",
      "“The unpredictability of the tariff situation continues to cause havoc and uncertainty on future pricing/cost. But even with the tariffs, the cost to import in many cases is still more attractive than sourcing within the U.S. Challenges with tariffs on production equipment necessary for internal production makes it difficult to justify expansion of capacity.” (Computer & Electronic Products)",
      "“Volatility in some of our highly exposed commodity markets has tempered a bit, thanks to improved weather conditions and overall downward pressure on pricing. Tariffs continue to remain difficult to quantify, manage and deal with in general, since they continue to impact us day-to-day and our bottom line.” (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)",
      "“Wonder has turned to concern regarding how the tariff threats are affecting our business. Orders are down across most divisions, and we’ve lowered our financial expectations for 2025.” (Chemical Products)"

      "\"Fairly flat quarter over quarter, but with us being in the safety and security sector (and with U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a customer), the recent bill that passed should result in an increase in business in the coming months.\" [Computer & Electronic Products]",
      "\"Sales continue at unprecedented growth, driven by data-center construction. Customers and the sales team continue to demand lower pricing, which drives down gross margins in face of input price increases, primarily from aluminum imports.\" [Chemical Products]",
      "\"These tariff wars are beginning to wear us out. It's been very difficult to forecast what we will pay in duties and calculate any cost savings we've had this year. Also, tariffs have disrupted our customs import bond. There is zero clarity about the future, and it's been a difficult few months trying to figure out where everything is going to land and the impact on our business. So far, tremendous and unexpected costs have been incurred.\" [Apparel, Leather & Allied Products]",
      "\"Currently, higher interest rates still depress the construction industry for new construction projects. Tariff policies are uncertain, which slows down (1) our investment in new projects, (2) component sourcing for new products, (3) blanket orders and (4) replenishment of large inventory quantities. Instead, we're working to shift suppliers to lower political risk countries or develop domestic sources. We are impacted by the higher tariffs on costs of raw materials and components both sourced domestically and from overseas, and we expect expenses will be higher in the third and fourth quarters as we consume the inventory received with new and higher tariffs or update costs from domestic sources in the second quarter.\" [Machinery]",
      "\"Sales softening more than usual during the summer. Negotiations with non-U.S. manufacturers are strained as we are reluctant to issue POs for deliveries three or more months into the future with prices that include current tariffs.\" [Fabricated Metal Products]",
      "\"In the health-care world we continue with 'business as normal,' but we are increasingly searching and assessing geopolitical risk mitigation options.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",
      "\"Tariffs are causing complete uncertainty around sourcing strategies. A sit-and-wait game for now.\" [Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components]",
      "\"Sales are about on par with 2024, but nowhere near budget forecast. Tariff concerns seem to be growing as the year progresses.\" [Nonmetallic Mineral Products]",
      "\"Business is steady, with solid bookings and backlog. Still uncertainty about tariffs and associated inflation.\" [Furniture & Related Products]",
      "\"Energy capacity, specifically in the grid operated by PJM Interconnection, continues to be one of the major concerns for business continuity and growth in this region. The procurement of power and rising natural gas prices in this region due to past green energy policies, coupled with future projected allocations for artificial intelligence data centers, adds additional stress to the PJM system.\" [Primary Metals]",
      "\"Cautiously stable. Tariff impacts are still being monitored. Some increases have been implemented while monitoring other products.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

Unfortunately, this is just the beginning unless something drastically changes, but the supply chain implications will grow — depots will not be stocked, less material will be available, and it will take years for domestic production to handle the needs (if companies even want to).\" [Primary Metals]",
      "\"The geopolitical environment remains volatile: (1) ongoing shifts in U.S. tariff policy make it difficult to plan, (2) emerging conflicts in the Middle East could pose long-term commodity risks and (3) China measures on rare earth materials are causing challenges. Overall outlook for our company is positive; it's just extremely hard to make near-term supply plans/strategies or budgets.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",
      "\"The word that best describes the current market outlook is 'uncertainty.' The erratic trade policy with on-again/off-again tariffs has led to price uncertainty for customers, who appear to be prepared to hold off large capital purchases until stability returns. This has resulted in further reductions in customer demand and softening sales for the balance of 2025. Operations has planned additional weeks of downtime at multiple plants to accommodate reduced orders. Next year's forecast is not any better at this point. Additionally, most electric vehicle (EV) projects have been delayed or canceled, resulting in a significant amount of unutilized capital investment. EV technology launches for 2026-28 have been delayed past 2030.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

As a result, we are potentially overpaying duties. Unsure of potential drawbacks. Implementation of tariffs and their application is sudden and abrupt. The business is taking countermeasures.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

Supplier relationships are strained by pain-share negotiations, and competitors are gaining share by importing from lower-tariff regions.\" [Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products]",
      "\"Tariff whiplash is causing us major issues with customers. The two issues we are seeing: (1) customers are holding back orders to understand what is happening with tariffs on their products or (2) they are forcing us to accept the tariffs, which causes us to 'no quote' the job as we cannot take on that type of risk for an order.\" [Machinery]",
      "\"There is a lot of concern about the inflationary impacts from tariffs in our industry. Domestic producers are charging more for everything because they can.\" [Fabricated Metal Products]",
      "\"Tariff trade wars are incredibly volatile, quickly changing, and disrupting a ton of our current work. We are 90 percent sourced out of China , and the cost models keep changing every week. We are flying to visit suppliers in a few weeks to negotiate current terms and pricing, as well as develop more long-term, strategic plans to reduce risk in the region.\" [Apparel, Leather & Allied Products]",
      "\"Demand is slightly lower than plan, but it has been steady amid tariff concerns. Significant time has been spent quantifying the impact of changing tariff rates. Our costs will increase, and we are discussing how to share that impact across suppliers and customers.\" [Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components]",
      "\"The recently imposed 145-percent tariff rate on Chinese imports is significantly affecting our 2025 profitability. Due to the complexity of our parts and the lack of alternate sources, we are unable to find any alternate suppliers — especially at a reasonable cost — to our current Chinese sources. Incoming orders have slowed due to market volatility and uncertainty.\" [Miscellaneous Manufacturing]",

Although inflation has stabilized and returned to historical levels, and interest rates are decreasing, there appears to be a general pessimism in the economy that is driving customers to be more restrictive in their capital expenditures, including investment in commercial vehicles. Uncertainty in the outcome of the upcoming election has resulted in several risk analysis studies to be prepared, particularly focused on the future of the electric vehicle (EV) migration and trade restrictions/penalties.\" [Transportation Equipment]",

      "\"Sales have been very slow the past six months. Interestingly, though, inquiries are up more than 30 percent from a year ago. This indicates there is pent-up demand, but customers are skittish about national and global economic conditions. We are hearing directly from customers that they need to order equipment to satisfy their requirements but are going to keep projects as long as possible before pulling the trigger.\" [Machinery]",

      "\"This has been an interesting fourth quarter already. The port strikes, hurricanes and election will all affect us in some way. Our industry is energy intensive, so our largest concern is the national and state mandates toward electrification. Electrical components were already in short supply, and with the substation and power line damages, we expect the electrical supply chain will be even worse. Components for green energy projects will be further delayed, but we don't expect the environmental mandates to be delayed.\" [Paper Products]",
      "\"The potential port strike sent ripple effects through our industry. We have several large imports occurring in January, which created anxiety around critical components being delivered on time for a large, planned capital project. The three recent hurricanes missed large manufacturing hubs on the Gulf Coast but have still caused minor delays.\" [Petroleum & Coal Products]",

Sales are lighter, and customer orders are coming in under forecasts. It seems consumers are starting to pull back on spending.\" [Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products]",

Ordering is still well below typical levels as we continue to burn down inventory of raw goods, with 'normal' ordering trends expected to return sometime in the second half of 2024.\" [Computer & Electronic Products]",
      "\"It seems that the economy is slowing down significantly. The number of sales calls received from new suppliers is increasing significantly. Our own order backlog is also diminishing. We are hoping for an increase in customer demand, or we will possibly need to make organizational changes.\" [Machinery]",

Suppliers are shipping materials at a faster pace, especially to get the payable process started at the end of the first quarter. Employment is steady, with manpower decisions based on expected order flow in the second quarter, which is subject to change. Staffing levels in our sector are not decreasing, but employment openings are slowing across the economy, which reduces the pool of replacement candidates. We are currently projecting that the third quarter will see some improvement in business, especially in our metals coating for the aerospace industry. But unforeseen circumstances — international or domestic — could change things quickly.\" [Chemical Products]",

Additionally, the logistics problems — especially port delays and a shortage of shipping containers — are significantly impacting inbound and outbound shipments.

      "\"Late-winter storms in unexpected [areas] of the U.S. had our organization exercising business-continuity plans on a much more aggressive scale than anticipated. While the storms slowed our supply chain down, we did what we could to meet orders, even though few were short. We feel that in the coming month, we will be able to make up the misses as well as continue strong deliveries in the next month. As consumer confidence grows and the academia market reopens globally, we do expect orders to increase.\" (Computer & Electronic Products)",
      "\"Demand remains strong. Significant supply impacts on raw materials due to the Texas freeze. All major raw-material and suppliers on force majeure.\" (Chemical Products)",
      "\"Business conditions are positive for our industry and company. The constraints are mainly related to parts availability (imports, supply chain congestion). Manpower is also a constraint; hiring new members is a challenge.\" (Transportation Equipment)",
      "\" Winter Storm Uri has made daily life in supply chain quite a challenge. Everything from plastic substrates to adhesives have been significantly impacted by the production interruptions.\" (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)",
      "\"The spring and summer months look great for the national oil markets.\" (Petroleum & Coal Products)",
      "\"A lack of qualified machine and fabrication shop talent makes it difficult to keep up with production demands when there is no backup (second string). Qualified new hires are an ongoing challenge. We have had to provide better compensation to keep qualified talent. Raw-material prices are up 50 percent to 60 percent over the last six months, which results in increased prices to our customers and a disincentive to build inventory.\" (Fabricated Metal Products)",
      "\"Widespread supply chain issues. Suppliers are struggling to manage demand and capacity in the face of chronic logistics and labor issues. No end in sight.\" (Machinery)",
      "\"Business is even stronger for us this year through the third quarter, and we expect a very healthy growth of our manufacturing sales.\" (Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components)",
      "\"Business bottomed out in February; we are expecting steady improvement through the end of the year. Inflation and material availability, along with logistics, are major concerns.\" (Furniture & Related Products)",
      "\"Tremendous stress on the supply chain since the winter storm in Texas . Chemicals are on allocations or unavailable. Resin is on allocation and unavailable.\" (Plastics & Rubber Products)",

The national election and continued COVID-19 uncertainty are concerns.\" (Machinery)",

      "\"COVID-19 continues to have an effect on supplier support and operations, more from a decreased labor perspective rather than unavailable material.\" (Computer & Electronic Products)",
      "\"Business continues to be robust. Sales are greater than expectations, and cost pressures are modest. There is posturing by suppliers on market price increases for corrugated and polypropylene, yet no firm price increases at this time. We expect a strong finish to 2020 and a solid start in 2021.\" (Chemical Products)",
      "\"Sales continue to be strong — up 4 percent this September compared to September 2019 . The year-to-date level is still 21 percent below last year due to the [COVID-19] shutdown, but sales are stronger than expected and forecast to stay strong through the first quarter of 2021.\" (Transportation Equipment)",
      "\"Increased production due to stores stocking up for the second wave of COVID-19.\" (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)",
      "\"Continue to see increases in customer demand. We still are not back to pre-COVID-19 levels but are continually improving.\" (Fabricated Metal Products)",
      "\"Construction materials have leveled off but continue to be at an all-time high. Mills for board sheet stock have pushed out lead times citing increasing backlogs related to the pandemic and increased supply in the housing market.\" (Furniture & Related Products)",
      "\"Business is almost back to normal levels; however, customers are still cautious with capital spending.\" (Machinery)",
      "\"Business levels have just about returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. Our company is remaining conservative with fixed-cost spending, knowing the uncertainties that lie ahead with COVID-19 and its potential impact globally.\" (Miscellaneous Manufacturing)",
      "\"October order books are the strongest we have seen in the past six months.\" (Paper Products)",
      "\"We continue to see stronger month-over-month orders in plastic injection molding.\" (Plastics & Rubber Products)",

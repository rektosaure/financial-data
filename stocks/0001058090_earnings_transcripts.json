[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Olsen\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nPlease see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Boatwright\n\nInterim Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations due to persistent macroeconomic pressures. However, we are moving quickly with a clear actionable plan to accelerate transaction growth.\nLet me first review our third quarter results. Sales grew 7.5% to reach $3 billion including a 0.3% increase in comp. Digital sales were 36.7% of total sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24.5% and a decline of 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.29, an increase of 7% over last year. and we opened 84 new restaurants, including 6 for Chipotle. Now I want to spend a minute addressing a few of the consumer headwinds we have experienced.\nEarlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency across all income cohorts. Since then, the gap has widened with low to middle-income guests further reducing frequency. We believe that [indiscernible] would household income below $100,000, represents about 40% of our total sales. And based on our data is dining out less often due to concerns about the economy, and inflation. A particularly challenged cohort is the 25- to 35-year-old age group.\nWe believe that this trend is not unique to Chipotle and is occurring across all restaurants as well as many discretionary categories. This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased due loan repayment and slower real wage growth. We tend to skew younger and slightly over-indexed to this group relative to the broader restaurant industry.\nFinally, the promotional environment has intensified with value as a price point and menu innovation escalating throughout the year. Despite these headwinds, Chipotle maintained stable wallet share in the third quarter, but we aim to get back to consistent share gains. While value as a price point is not and will not be a Chipotle strategy, we are using this challenging period to strengthen our consumer flywheel by improving execution, enhancing how we communicate value and accelerating menu and digital innovation.\nI will give you more specifics on our initiatives to drive transactions in just a moment. But first, I will review our 5 key strategies that will help us win today and grow our future. And these include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.\nSustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level, making the brand visible, relevant and love to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain, and expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\nI will start with a combination of operations and world-class people leadership. We recently held our team director conference with our leaders who each oversee a subregion or region of the country. What is incredible about being in a room with these 80 leaders is that 85% were promoted internally and the average tenure is nearly 15 years.\nAdditionally, [ 29 ] started as crew members and grew within the organization. So this group understands that during challenging times, experience in the restaurant is more important than ever and improving it will build loyalty and drive higher frequency in the future. During the meeting, we discussed that Chipotle has experienced slowing transaction trends several times since going public.\nDuring each period, we doubled down on getting the fundamentals right in our restaurants, which reinforces and strengthens our value proposition through execution, not discounts. And this enabled Chipotle to exit each period stronger with accelerating transaction trends that follow.\nAs a reminder, our value proposition includes food, made fresh with the highest quality ingredients prepared using classic culinary techniques, served in generous portions with reliable accuracy and fast friendly service. Currently, all of this is delivered at a price point that is 20% to 30% below our peers. This gap has widened over the last few years as our pricing has consistently trailed the broader restaurant industry.\nIn fact, our pricing has tracked more closely with food at home and food away from home. Bottom line, our value proposition has never been stronger. Now it is important that we deliver this exceptional experience consistently across 4,000 restaurants every day for every guest. With this in mind, we renewed our problem detection survey. While we improved in key areas like [indiscernible] and portion sizes, we have room to be better. For example, in my visits to our restaurants, I still see inconsistencies in delivering Chipotle standard of excellence including digital order accuracy, ingredient availability and the [indiscernible] of our dining room and drink stations.\nTo address this, we are reemphasizing standards with system-wide retraining and our recent quarterly bonus incentives to better align with digital order accuracy and the guest experience. Additionally, we are upgrading our restaurants with a high-efficiency equipment package, or HEAT, as we call it, to improve the team experience and throughput while maintaining or improving upon our high-quality culinary.\nAs a reminder, these include the dual-sided place, the 3 pan rice cooker and the high capacity prior. While throughput reviews continue to show progress on Expo and the 4 pillars, we believe the rollout of HEAT will drive the next step function change in throughput as it simplifies [ prep ] enabling our teams to be properly deployed at peak periods more consistently. In restaurants where our high-efficiency equipment packages live, feedback from the field has been positive.\nOur teams report more consistent higher-quality culinary execution, more efficient prep and an overall improved team experience. For example, the new [indiscernible] cooks chicken and steak to perfection in less than half the time. expanding morning capacity and helping us to keep up through peak. In these restaurants, we are seeing the taste of food and guest satisfaction scores improve in addition to a yield savings and greater labor efficiency. We remain on track with the rollout of heat across the country, which we anticipate will take around 3 years. Shifting to marketing and menu innovation. In the third quarter, we accelerated our marketing spend to communicate the brand's extraordinary value through menu innovation, our rewards platform and high engagement promotions like the college football [indiscernible] and Chipotle IQ.\nBased on our data, these initiatives successfully drove transactions and deepened guest engagement, helping to offset some of the incremental consumer headwinds in August and September. This response reinforces our focus on transaction-led growth going forward. I will start with menu innovation. Through our research, we found that over 90% of Gen Z consumers said they would visit a restaurant just for a new sauce. Adobo Ranch proved this to be true and it was our first new dip in 5 years that help acquire new guests and drive incremental transactions. Earlier this month, we rolled out Red [indiscernible], which pairs exceptionally well with our limited time offer, [indiscernible] the sauce is prepared with only real ingredients, no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors and made fresh in our restaurants every day.\nAs we rolled it out, it drove a step-up in transactions and is around low double-digit incidents. It also drove an acceleration in trial of carne asada. Our culinary team is working hard to meaningfully accelerate our pace of innovation for 2026 to deliver new flavor experiences that are on trend, on brand, and operationally friendly to execute.\nIn addition to sides and dips, our innovation will include 3 to 4 limited time protein offers. Our past cadence of 2 offers a year has helped to drive a step change in transactions. In fact, we see in our data that new and existing guests who purchase LTOs increase frequency and spend over the following year compared to guests who do not purchase an LTO. Adding 1 or 2 more will keep Chipotle more visible, relevant and love throughout the year. Moving forward, we also plan to build awareness around new occasions that we believe could scale and be sizable pieces of our business over time.\nA few weeks ago, we launched a 60 restaurant catering pilot in Chicago. The test includes the high-efficiency equipment package to expedite prep and increase capacity in addition to a new technology stack to better manage orders. We also plan to make a full marketing push to drive demand into catering, including third-party platforms. As a reminder, our goal is to scale the catering business within our restaurants without disrupting the core operations. With catering at 1% to 2% of sales versus our peers at 5% to 10%, it could represent a meaningful opportunity in the future.\nAnd last month, we rolled out Build Your Own Chipotle, our version of a family or group occasion with the ability to build custom bowls and tacos for a party of 4 to 6. Early guest feedback has been positive and we are seeing little cannibalization as it is bringing new guests and driving higher frequency. We believe the family or group occasion is another big opportunity over time as groups of 4 or more only make up about 2% of transactions. Finally, we are elevating how we communicate Chipotle's value.\nDespite our extraordinary value proposition, we are seeing examples where this is not reflected in consumer perception. We are planning to launch a new creative campaign that spotlights, blood sets Chipotle apart, including clean ingredients, freshly prepped in our restaurants each day using classic culinary techniques served an abundance speed and price point, you can't get anywhere else. You will see new adds that address these aspects of our value proposition in really creative ways rolling out over the coming quarter and into 2026.\nNow turning to digital. We believe we have an opportunity to create more engaging experiences that drive consumers into the rewards funnel, increasing our active members and resulting in higher frequency and spend. We learned from summer of extras that gamification is a great way to drive frequency even with our most infrequent guests. Combination of summer of extras as well as incremental promotions like Chipotle IQ and Freepotle, resulted in loyalty comps accelerating versus non-loyalty comps over the last several months. Additionally, our College Rewards program, or Chipotle U, is off to a good start as enrollees are increasing their spend after joining the program. We will continue to build awareness around Chipotle U and believe the program will be a great way to increase engagement throughout the year with this important cohort. Going forward, we are planning to make some significant additions to the rewards program to drive an increase in active members and improve engagement. We'll have more to share in coming quarters.\nNow moving to [indiscernible] access. Over the past several years, we have made tremendous progress scaling our new restaurant openings from 140 openings in 2019 to an expected 315 to 345 this year. all while delivering industry-leading economics and returns. On average, that is nearly 1 new restaurant opening every day. In North America, our new restaurant openings remained strong with consistent new restaurant productivity around 80% in year 2 cash-on-cash returns around 60%. We remain confident in our ability to reach 7,000 restaurants long term. In Europe, we have made great strides in culinary and operational execution, and we continue to grow comps.\nRestaurant margins and cash-on-cash returns. Next year, we will begin to expand new restaurant openings in the region, and we continue to believe Europe is a big opportunity for Chipotle over time. In the Middle East, we opened 2 partner-operated restaurants with the [indiscernible] bringing our total to 7 restaurants, including our first in Qatar.\nAdditionally, this week, we opened our first Chipotlane outside of North America in Kuwait and we will open 2 additional partner operated restaurants in the Middle East next month. The familiarity, excitement and fandom for the brand delivered at U.S. standards has been strong, reflecting an opening volumes that rival the best we have seen in the U.S. and Canada. And in September, we announced our first joint venture partnership in Asia with SPC, with restaurants in South Korea and Singapore anticipated to open in 2026.\nSouth Korea is a trend center for pop culture across Asia with growing influence in the United States in the response to our announcement has been exceptionally strong. With high brand familiarity in both markets, a passion for exceptional culinary experiences and a rapidly evolving dining out landscape, these are ideal entry points for Chipotle in the region. In 2026, we anticipate opening between 350 and 370 new restaurants. In addition to growth in North America. This will include 10 to 15 new partner-operated restaurants in the Middle East, South Korea, Singapore and Mexico in 1 to 2 new company-owned restaurants in Europe. To close, I want to reiterate that our brand and value proposition are in a great place, and we are leveraging this challenging time to refocus and provide clarity for our organization. Through our rigorous ground-up review of the business, we have identified ways to accelerate our flywheel of operations, marketing and digital that will further strengthen and grow this great brand. In operations, we are elevating hospitality and throughput.\nIn marketing, we are sharpening our message to highlight our extraordinary culinary and strong value proposition while expanding menu innovation and growing new occasions. And in digital, we are creating more engaging personal experiences that deepen our guest loyalty and grows our rewards platform. We are also working to define the next evolution of our long-term strategy, which we are calling recipe for growth. and we'll have more to share in the coming quarters.\nAs we execute this plan, we are confident that we will return to consistent positive transaction growth, putting us on a path to surpass $4 million in AUVs over time. expanded 7,000 restaurants in North America long term and accelerate international expansion as we make our way to becoming a global iconic brand. With that, I will turn it over to Adam.\n\nAdam Rymer\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the third quarter grew 7% year-over-year to reach $3 billion, including a comparable sales increase of 0.3%. The Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% declined about 100 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share grew 4% year-over-year to $0.29 on a GAAP basis and grew 7% to $0.29 on a non-GAAP basis adjusted for unusual items.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced another step down in our underlying trend. While we did see encouraging results as we accelerated our marketing spend and rolled out [indiscernible], our underlying trends remained challenged throughout the quarter and into October.\nTaking this into consideration as well as the ongoing macro uncertainty, we now anticipate full year comps to decline in the low single-digit range. As a reminder, we will be rolling off 2 points of price in early December. Additionally, inflation is accelerating into the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to tariffs and rising beef costs, and we anticipate it will remain in this range in 2026.\nWe do not plan to fully offset this incremental inflation in the near term. And while this will pressure margins, we think it's the right thing to do to continue to provide extraordinary value to our guests during this challenging economic backdrop. I will now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales.\nCost of sales in the quarter were 30%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. The benefit of our menu price increase from last year and cost of sales efficiencies more than offset inflation, primarily in beef and chicken as well as the impact of tariffs. Tariffs impacted the quarter by about 30 basis points, and we continue to estimate that we will see about a 50 basis point ongoing impact from tariffs which does not include any impact from Mexican or Canadian imports that fall under the U.S. MCA exemption. For Q4, we anticipate cost of sales to be in the high 30% range as we have a full quarter of our premium [indiscernible] limited time offer as well as higher beef prices.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 25.2%, an increase of about 30 basis points from last year. as higher pricing was more than offset by lower volumes and wage inflation. For Q4, we expect our labor cost to be in the high 25% range with wage inflation in the low single-digit range. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15%, an increase of about 120 basis points from last year, primarily driven by higher marketing costs and lower sales volumes. Marketing costs were 3% of sales in Q3, an increase of about 90 basis points from last year.\nAs Scott mentioned, we accelerated our marketing spend in the quarter, which helped to offset some of the slowing underlying trends we experienced in August and September. We expect our marketing costs to remain around 3% of sales for Q4 and for the full year. For Q4, we anticipate other operating costs to be about 15%. G&A for the quarter was $147 million on a GAAP basis or $139 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $8 million related to retention equity awards granted to key executives in August of 2024.\nG&A also includes $137 million in underlying G&A, $8 million related to noncash stock compensation, which included a reduction in our performance share accruals and related to payroll taxes on equity vesting, $1 million related to our upcoming. All Manager Conference, which will be held in Q1 of next year, offset by $8 million in lower bonus accruals. We expect G&A in the fourth quarter to be around $161 million on a non-GAAP basis, which will include $145 million in underlying G&A as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth. around $26 million in noncash stock compensation, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance, around $2 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference offset by $12 million in lower bonus accruals. Depreciation for the quarter was $91 million or 3% of sales.\nFor 2025, we expect it to remain around 3% of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 23.1% for GAAP and 22.8% for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from lower nondeductible expenses. For fiscal 2025, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments is no debt. During the third quarter, we purchased $687 million of our stock at an average price of $42.39 and bringing our year-to-date total to a record $1.7 billion at an average price of $47.74. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $500 million to our share purchase authorization and at the end of the quarter, we had $652 million remaining.\nTo close, I want to thank all of our restaurant and restaurant support teams for their hard work and commitment to Chipotle. Times like these, our strong economic model gives us the flexibility to invest in our brand, our guest experience and our value proposition. And as we have seen in the past, this will further strength in Chipotle and allow us to emerge from this period of consumer uncertainty even stronger than when we entered it. We are confident in our path forward, and we are ready to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market projections, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Boatwright\n\nInterim Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, our restaurant teams did an extraordinary job of executing in a challenging environment, including delivering exceptional food throughput and hospitality as well as managing their controllable costs. Additionally, we are beginning to see some of the benefits of our back-of-house initiatives as we complete the rollout of the produce slicer.\nNow let me review our second quarter results. Sales for the second quarter grew 3% to reach $3.1 billion, including a negative 4% comp. Digital sales were 35.5% of total sales. Restaurant-level margin was 27.4%, a decline of 150 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.33, a decline of 3% over last year. And we opened 61 new restaurants, including 47 Chipotlanes.\nI will start with an update on our current trends. While we experienced a slowdown in our underlying trend in May, we did see momentum build as we rolled out our summer marketing initiatives and leaned into hospitality. And exiting the quarter, we returned to a positive comp and transaction trends, which have continued into July.\nHowever, considering the ongoing volatility in our trends in the consumer environment, we now anticipate comparable sales to be about flat for the full year. With that said, we have a strong plan to build on our industry-leading value proposition and accelerate transactions. The fact is in most markets, for around $10 before taxes and fees, you can get a handcrafted Chicken Bowl or Burrito filled in abundance with the best ingredients, made fresh in our restaurants using classic culinary techniques at a speed at which you cannot find anywhere else. This is a 20% to 30% discount to comparable fast casual meals and often below comparable meals at many quick service restaurants. Going forward, we will roll out new and creative ways to emphasize our value proposition while improving the benefit of our offering through better execution, menu innovation and amplifying our rewards program, which we'll get to in just a few moments.\nFirst, I will review our 5 key strategies that will help win today while we grow our future. These strategies include: running successful restaurants with people accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; making the brand visible, relevant and loved to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement; amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers, and our supply chain; expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally; and sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level.\nI want to reiterate that we have a lot of opportunity to drive consistent transaction growth over the upcoming years as we execute against the first 3 of our 5 key strategies, or our flywheel of operations, marketing and digital experience. Starting with operations. We recently appointed Jason Kidd as Chief Operating Officer. He's off to a tremendous start and brings a wealth of knowledge and vast operational experience at large-scale multiunit retail. I have no doubt that he is the right person to lead and inspire the 130,000 people that make up our restaurant teams and that he will also bring new strategic thinking to our executive team.\nThis quarter, I am pleased to say that we continued to make progress around throughput execution as the percentage of restaurants with an expo in place is now over 70%. In addition to coaching and training around the 4 pillars of throughput, we just completed the rollout of the produce slicers across all restaurants, and we are starting to see back-of-house benefits as it enables our teams to complete prep on time and be properly deployed for their peak period.\nIn addition to the slicer, we have begun rolling out the high-efficiency equipment package, which includes the dual-sided plancha, the 3 pan rice cooker and the high-capacity fryer. We anticipate this rollout will create a more scalable Chipotle with many benefits, including an improvement in the consistency and quality of our culinary and an increase in prep efficiencies that will help our teams be properly deployed for peak, driving faster throughput. This will lead to a better team member and guest experience and potentially could unlock additional growth platforms for our business like catering.\nFor the rollout, we plan to do a phased stage-gate approach, and we anticipate by the end of year, the high-efficiency equipment target will be in hundreds of restaurants, including the subregion where we plan to introduce our catering test in the fall and all new restaurant openings beginning in the fourth quarter. Based on our learnings, we can accelerate the rollout later this year, and we estimate it will take around 3 years to complete across all existing restaurants.\nWe also recently opened a new restaurant innovation space, where we have a team working on emergent technology that rethinks our tools and processes holistically rather than as bolt-on additions. Currently, this includes a high-efficiency equipment package, our augmented digital makeline, Autocado and a vision system. Ultimately, we aim to identify the ideal technology and operating model to enhance culinary standards, improve the team and guest experience and drive higher returns in our restaurants.\nThe next pillar of our comp flywheel of marketing while making Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. Over the last 2 summers, we have experienced a slowdown in trends as our guests typically step out of their routine and our marketing spend seasonally slows. To increase visibility and drive engagement, we made the decision to ramp up our summer marketing strategy and meet our guests where they are by doubling our reach in social and streaming, adding incremental menu innovation and launching our first ever seasonal program for rewards members called Summer of Extras. This has been successful in driving an acceleration in our underlying trends.\nIn terms of menu innovation, Chipotle Honey Chicken has the highest incidence rate of all of our limited time offers and is included in 1 out of every 4 orders. The guest feedback has been very positive. It will certainly be another LTO that we will bring back in the future. We also introduced Adobo Ranch last month, which is our first dip in 5 years. This is our smoky spicy twist on classic ranch made fresh in our restaurants and featuring only real ingredients. It is delicious, easy to execute and off to a great start driving incremental transactions. We see more opportunity in sides and dips in the future, and we'll have more to share as they make their way through the stage-gate process.\nIn social, we leverage user-generated content to launch a Tatted Like a Chipotle bag BOGO, which is 1 of our best-performing BOGOs ever despite only being available for 1 hour as it drove more than double the sales of a normal 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. time frame. Additionally, while the BOGO was only in-store, the over 100 million social impressions had a media halo effect, driving more guests into our digital channel, making it a highly incremental promotion.\nBased on the learnings and success of the recent marketing initiatives and as we start to think about 2026 and beyond, I believe we have a lot more opportunity to increase visibility, highlight our value proposition and add incremental menu innovation that drives consumer relevance and love for the brand all year long. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we will be testing a new catering platform this fall in a subregion of about 60 restaurants. The test will include the high-efficiency equipment package to help expedite prep and increase capacity. It will also include a new technology stack to help load balance orders across restaurants as well as a full marketing push to drive demand into catering.\nOur goal is to scale the catering business within our restaurants without disrupting the core operations. With catering at just about 1% to 2% of sales versus our peers who are at 5% to 10%, we think this could be a big opportunity longer term.\nShifting to the final piece of the flywheel, the digital experience. We continue to find ways to enhance our app functionality to provide a seamless experience for our guests. This includes a recent update to the app providing the ability to personalize multiple message offerings such as rewards, reminders and menu suggestions. Within rewards, about 20 million members are active or have transacted at least once in the last year.\nTo drive more people into our loyalty program, we are ramping up our enrollment campaigns and signage, both in restaurant and digitally. We also recently launched Summer of Extras, a 3-month gamified experience with extra points, [ badges ] and prices as our rewards members reach milestones. Results have been very encouraging as we drive more people into the rewards program and increasing their frequency and spend year-over-year. We have another exciting program planned for the fall of targeting the college cohort, and we will continue to find creative ways to drive enrollment and improve engagement.\nWhen you layer all these opportunities within the flywheel, we are confident in getting back to mid-single-digit comps and surpassing $4 million in AUVs longer term. And our 40% flow-through remains intact with the potential for additional margin opportunities as we continue to improve the back-of-house experience.\nNow moving to expanding access. In the U.S. and Canada, we opened 61 new restaurants, which marked a record for the second quarter. We now have 61 restaurants in Canada. And over the last 5 years, we have nearly tripled the business with economics, on par with the U.S.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, we remain on track to open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year, with 80% including a Chipotlane. We are also confident in our ability to grow new restaurant openings between 8% and 10% and to reach 7,000 restaurants longer term. We are also establishing a solid foundation in other international markets, which will enable Chipotle to extend its growth runway for decades.\nIn Europe, economics continue to progress with positive consumer feedback on the improvement and the experience, including the quality of the culinary. Our Head of Europe and Canada is doing an excellent job of building the team and culture to be able to scale, similar to what she did in Canada several years ago.\nIn the Middle East, our restaurant in the Avenues Mall in Kuwait completed its first year of operations, with revenue surpassing the average unit volume in the United States. We have 5 restaurants open in Kuwait and Dubai, and Alshaya Group plans to accelerate growth in the back half of the year. We remain on track to open our first restaurant with Alsea in Mexico early next year and continue to evaluate other potential partnerships in different parts of the world. Based on our progress in our current markets and discussions with partners, we have a lot of confidence that Chipotle's fresh, craveable, culinary served fast will resonate around the world.\nFinally, moving to sustaining world-class people leadership. We are often asked if there are parts of the Chipotle story that are underappreciated, and I believe there are 2: Our purpose of cultivating a better world and our culture of people development. Not only does our purpose give our teams pride in what they do every day, but with around 80% internal promotions, our teams can visualize their own growth within the organization, which is critical as we scale and build the brand.\nThe growth of our Canadian business is a notable example. Our Team Director in Canada has been with Chipotle for 23 years. She started as an apprentice general manager in Texas and then moved to Canada to become the first field leader in the country. Her deep connection with her teams and her ability to develop and grow future leaders stood out, which led to her becoming Canada's first Team Director about 5 years ago. We decided to accelerate growth in the country. She has now developed 8 of our 10 field leaders within the region and is an inspiration to our Canadian restaurant teams who see her path as achievable.\nThis is what Chipotle is all about, cultivating a better world by not only expanding access to our delicious, fresh food, but by creating life-changing opportunities for our people along the way. To close, I want to thank our teams for all their hard work bringing the Chipotle culinary experience to life each and every day. I am optimistic about our operational improvements and early results and learnings from our summer marketing initiatives, which we will use to enhance our value proposition moving forward.\nI continue to see so much opportunity ahead by leveraging our flywheel of operations, marketing and digital to drive our AUVs north of $4 million longer term. Additionally, we will continue to invest in our restaurants and backhouse initiatives to create a more scalable Chipotle as we grow to 7,000 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada and making our way to becoming a global iconic brand. This will require an exceptional team of people committed to paying homage to our culinary beginnings and our purpose while focusing on our long runway of growth ahead. I am confident that we have the right team and a clear strategy to achieve this ambitious goal.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Adam.\n\nAdam Rymer\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the second quarter grew 3% year-over-year to reach $3.1 billion, including a comparable sales decline of 4%. Restaurant level margin of 27.4% declined about 150 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share was $0.32 on a GAAP basis and $0.33 on a non-GAAP basis adjusted for unusual items, representing 3% year-over-year decline.\nAs Scott mentioned, in May, we saw a step down in our underlying transaction trend, followed by a reacceleration in June as we rolled out our summer marketing initiatives. While comparable sales and transactions turned positive in June and this trend continued into July, given the ongoing volatility in our sales trends in the consumer environment, we now anticipate comps to be about flat for the full year.\nI will now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 28.9%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit of our menu price increase from last year and cost of sales efficiencies more than offset inflation, primarily in steak and chicken. Relative to our guidance, we benefited from lower-than-anticipated avocado prices, a better-than-expected benefit from cost of sales efficiencies and a lower impact from tariffs.\nThanks to these efficiencies, which include both supply chain and in-restaurant initiatives, we have now more than offset the portion of investment we made last year. For Q3, we expect our cost of sales will step up to the high 29% range, with about 60 basis points of the step-up due to the mix impact from rolling off Chipotle Honey Chicken and 40 basis points due to tariffs. We estimate that we will see about a 50 basis point ongoing impact from tariffs, which remains in line with our commentary from last quarter and does not include any impact from Mexican or Canadian imports that fall into the USMCA exemption. We still anticipate underlying cost of sales inflation to be in the low single-digit range for the remainder of the year, which excludes impacts from LTOs and tariffs as well as benefits from cost of sales initiatives.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 24.7%, an increase of about 60 basis points from last year, primarily driven by lower volumes as higher pricing and better labor execution more than offset wage inflation. For Q3, we expect our labor cost to be in the high 24% range with wage inflation in the low single-digit range for the remainder of the year. Regarding labor execution, our restaurant teams did a fantastic job managing labor throughout the quarter, supported by the rollout of the new produce license. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14%, an increase of about 110 basis points from last year, primarily driven by higher marketing costs and lower volumes.\nMarketing costs were 2.7% of sales in Q2, an increase of about 60 basis points from last year. In Q3, we expect marketing cost to step up to the mid-2% range, with the full year in the high 2% range. For Q3, we anticipate other operating costs to be in the mid-14% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $172 million on a GAAP basis or $160 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $12 million related to retention, equity awards granted to key executives last August. G&A also includes $140 million in underlying G&A, $23 million related to noncash stock compensation, which included a reduction in our performance share approvals, $2 million related to restaurant leadership conferences, offset by $5 million in lower bonus accruals. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $139 million in Q3. We anticipate the third quarter G&A will also include around $29 million in stock-based compensation, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance, around $2 million in employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and around $1 million related to restaurant leadership conferences, offset by $8 million in lower bonus accruals, bringing our anticipated total non-GAAP G&A in Q3 to around $163 million.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $91 million or 3% of sales. For 2025, we expect it to remain around 3% of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.5% for GAAP and 24.2% for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above the grant values. For fiscal 2025, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt. During the second quarter, we purchased $436 million of our stock at an average price of $50.16, bringing our year-to-date total to a record $990 million at an average price of $52.32. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $400 million to our share purchase authorization. And at the end of the quarter, we had $839 million remaining.\nTo close, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for their dedication to Chipotle and their execution this quarter. Our strong economic model rooted in real ingredients, exceptional value and industry-leading margins and returns allows us to continue to invest in our people and our growth. As Scott laid out, we have a long runway for growth in front of us in both the U.S. and internationally.\nAnd with that, we'll open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call.\nBy now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nPlease see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of the risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking patents. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Boatwright\n\nInterim Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. While our first quarter results were impacted by several headwinds, including weather and a slowdown in consumer spending, our teams continue to make great progress improving the execution in our restaurants, testing and rolling out exciting back-of-house innovation and building out our brand in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, Chipotle Honey Chicken is off to a terrific start, driving incremental transactions in our restaurants. .\nNow turn to our first quarter results. Sales grew over 6% to reach $2.9 billion, including a comparable sales decline of 0.4%. Digital sales presented 35.4% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 26.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.29, representing 7% growth over the last year, and we opened 57 new restaurants, including 48 Chipotlanes.\nBefore I give an update on our 5 key strategies, I will provide inside current trends and outlook. In February, we began to see that the elevated level of emergency felt by consumers starting to impact their spending habits. We could see this in our visitation study where saving money because of concerns around the economy was the overwhelming reason consumers were reducing the frequency of strong visits. This drove a slowdown in our underlying trends and trends, this trend has continued into April. While we can't predict how long these consumer headwinds will last, what I do know is that the Chipotle brand has never been stronger, that we have an extraordinary proposition that is more important than ever to focus on being guest obsessed to earn every transaction.\nNow turning to our outlook. Current underlying trends would result in a low single-digit full year comp and returned to positive transaction growth in the second half of the year. We also have several near-term initiatives that I'm confident will accelerate this trend. Before I get into the details of these initiatives, I want to first review our 5 key strategies that will help win today when we draw our future.\nAnd these strategies include: Running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; making the brand visible, relevant and love to acquire new guests and improve overall engagement; sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level and expanding access and kits by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\nFirst, starting with our restaurants. Our value proposition is rooted in exceptional people serving delicious food, fast throughput and affordable price point. In fact, the average cost of our most popular entree at chicken bowl or Burrito is still under $10, which is about 20% to 30% below comparable fast casual meals and can reach as high as 50% below comparable meals in some markets. What you get for this price is handcrafted, high-quality culinary in abundance at a speed in which you can't find anywhere else. This is resonating with our guests, and we can see it in our brand tracker, which continues to gain momentum. In fact, our latest survey shows Chipotle ranks top 3 in a record 15 perceptual drivers and leads in ties, including good amount of food for your money and quality of ingredients.\nWe believe that we have built a strong competitive advantage by delivering on this value proposition year after year. and our success today and in the future relies on our ability to continue to wow our guests when they choose to eat at Chipotle. Our teams are working hard, and our culinary and throughput continue to be key differentiators for the brand. However, we do have an opportunity to lean into exceptional hospitality as part of our focus on being guest obsessed.\nAt our new leader conference in March, which included all leaders above restaurant general managers, I posed this simple question. What if, in addition to great culinary and great speed, we all knew our commitment to great hospitality. With this in mind, we laid out specific actions to be accomplished in our restaurants that will not interrupt our focus on throughput. This includes a friendly smile at Tortilla, a heartfelt thank you from our cashier, clean dining rooms and drink stations and great guest on-site recovery for any issue. The fact is smart down the line don't slow us down.\nOur restaurant leaders have cascaded this message and rolled out training tools to all of our nearly 3,800 restaurants. While it will take time to build the Gives culture across 130,000 team members, I am confident that we can do this and it will further strengthen our industry-leading value proposition at a time when our guests appreciate it most.\nAdditionally, exceptional throughput remains a key priority, and we continue to make progress on executing the 4 pillars of throughput, including In fact, our recent review show that a handful of our subregions, which average of 60 restaurants each have an Expo in place over 80% of the time. While this tells us what is possible, our reviews also show us that restaurants without an expo in place, often still prepping and not properly deployed for the peak period. As a reminder, our prep process begins at 6 or 7:00 in the morning so that we can be finished by the time we open at 10:30 a.m.\nFor those who have not seen Prep at a Chipotle restaurant, it looks like a farmer's market, including whole heads of romaine lettuce, 25-pound bags of whole onions, boxes of builtup, alpines in avocados and bunches of Salantro. When our crew arrives in the morning, they grab knives, cutting boards, pots and pans and get to work preparing our delicious food.\nSometimes, restaurants get behind in the morning and as a role are not properly deployed for the peak period, preventing the execution of the 4 pillars, including In addition to consistent training and reps, we also believe our back-of-house equipment innovation, the next big unlock for more restaurants to complete prep on time and be ready for throughput at peak.\nThis brings me to amplifying technology and innovation. We are well underway testing and rolling out innovative tools that will modernize the merits for our team members about compromising Chipotle's heritage, high-quality and crafted culinary experience, including the farmers market that I just described.\nWe remain on track to have the producer of all restaurants by this summer, which will improve the speed of prep and improve the area by ensuring consistent cut sizes for onions, bell peppers and Halapenias. We are also expanding the rollout of the equipment package, which includes the dual-sided 3-pan rice cooker and the high-capacity fryer. In addition to new restaurant open, will begin in Q4 of this year, we are now in the process of rolling out the equipment package to an additional 100 existing restaurants over the next few months. Based on the results, we can accelerate the rollout to all restaurants, which we believe we can complete over the next several years.\nWhile we do anticipate that we will realize efficiencies from these initiatives, some of this will be invested back into our restaurants to enhance the experience for our team and our guests. This will enable our crews to be properly deployed during peaks, driving better throughput and a better guest experience. will also improve and drive consistency across culinary, which is key as we continue to scale this great brand.\nFinally, we continue to make progress with both Autocado and the augmented digital makeline. These are both customized pieces of equipment, co-develop Chipotle and our innovative partners. We have gone through several iterations, including in-restaurant testing. And over the last couple of months, both were back at our Cultivate Center for enhancements. Autocado is now back in the rest for further testing and an augmented digital make line will be back in later this summer. We are happy with the progress we are seeing and remain optimistic about both pieces of equipment. Turning to marketing. Our triple Honey Chicken limited time offer is off to a strong start. Since its launch in March, it has had a higher mix than any other limited offer, even surpassing its 2-market pilot test. It is also driving incremental transactions and the guest feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. I am confident this will be another successful LTO to bring back in the future.\nLooking forward, our marketing team has an enhanced plan for the summer and the remainder of the year to make Chipotle visible, more relevant and more loved to drive difference, drive purchase and drive culture. For example, beginning in May and continuing through the summer, we will meaningfully ramp up our marketing spend to reach more guests and meet them where they are. This will include menu innovation around the possible site or dip, increasing marketing in our digital and social channels in our rewards platform to target specific customer cohorts and group occasions.\nWe are also rethinking our catering business, which we see as an opportunity long term. Today, catering is only about 1.5 sales with little or no marketing. is 1 of the best experiences at Chipotle. We have developed a plan to scale the business and will roll out a catering test this fall in one of our subregions. Our test will include the new equipment package, additional storage as well as new technology to best allocate orders and drive demand. We can then see if it allowed to effectively kill the catering business without impacting our core business, we will share our learnings along the way.\nNow shifting to our exceptional people. When we ask our teams what they love most about working at Chipotle, they consistently mentioned industry benefits, Colony commitment to food with integrity and their ability to grow within the organization. Our growth resulted in countless inspiring stories of life-changing careers to make Chipotle a very special company to look for. But at our leader conference in March, we featured and celebrated the successful journey of one of our team directors. 20 year old, he moved to the United States and started working at Chipotle as a crew member. Over the last 12 years, he worked his way up through the organization. He credits his General Manager and his team Director for helping him develop and grow along the way, including learning English, buying is first home and supporting his family. And now he's one of our top leaders managing $200 million business. This type leader inspires our teams and is it to build a strong culture in their restaurants, which is key to stability and consistency. This drives a great experience for our team, which then ladders up to a great experience for our guests, ultimately driving results.\nOuter focus on developing exceptional people makes us an employer of choice. And I'm proud to share that we were recognized again by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. And we continue to have so much more opportunity for our teams as we aim to promote 90% internal scale to our long-term goal of 7,000 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada.\nFinally, moving to expanding access. In the U.S. and Canada, we opened 57 new restaurants in the quarter, we remain on track to open between 315 and 345 new restaurants this year with 80% include potline. This includes 15 to 20 new restaurants in Canada, which will mark another record year of openings. New restaurant economics remained strong with year 2 cash on returns around 60%. Additionally, our overall cash-on-cash return is in the low 80% range as restaurants continue to grow their economics over time, which gives us a lot of confidence in long-term growth targets.\nIn the Middle East, we opened 2 more Alshaya Group in February. We now have 5 restaurants opened, including 3 in Kuwait and 2 in Dubai. Results continue to be very strong as we mentioned last quarter. We will accelerate growth this year with the Alshaya Group.\nFinally, I'm excited to share that we recently signed a new partnership, a leading operator in Latin America and Europe to open restaurants in Mexico. We anticipate the first restaurant to open in early 2026, and we will also begin to explore possible expansion into additional markets in the region.\nTo close, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for their commitment to being guest obsessed. During these uncertain economic times, our objective is to invest in the things that make Chipotle special brand. Our people, our culinary, our value proposition, our innovation and our growth. By doing so, we expect that our business will be even stronger when the economic headwinds subside.\nWe continue to be optimistic about our ability to expand 7,000 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, grow our TVs to over $4 million, expand margins and make our way to becoming a global iconic brand. Not only will this mean for delicious real food around the world, but it will also mean growth of our people and the impact of our purpose to cultivate a better work more communities.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Adam.\n\nAdam Rymer\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew over 6% year-over-year to reach $2.9 billion, including a comparable sales decline of 0.4%. The restaurant level margin of 26.2% declined about 130 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share was $0.28 on a GAAP basis and $0.29 on a non-GAAP basis adjusted for unusual items, representing 7% year-over-year growth.\nAs Scott mentioned, in February, we began to see that the eligible of uncertainty felt by consumers was starting to impact their spending. This drove a meaningful change in our underlying transaction trend that has continued into April with some improvement late in the quarter from the success of Chipotle Honey chicken.\nAs we look to Q2, we are facing our most challenging comparison as we lap a 0.2% comp from last year, including a high teens comp in April. Additionally, we roll off about 90 basis points of price and have an additional 100 basis point headwind due to the timing of Easter. With all of this in mind, we think it is best to consider our 2 stacked comp trend, which was around 7% in February and March and accelerated by about 100 basis points into April. Assuming no change in the consumer environment, we anticipate that this trend to Q2 and for comps to turn positive exiting the quarter, comparisons to ease and will return us to positive transaction growth in the second half of the year.\nI will now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.2%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. The revenue price increase was more than offset by inflation and higher usage across several items, most notably avocados, dairy and chicken in addition to the mix impact from limited time offers.\nRelative to our guidance, avocados were favorable as the year-over-year step-up was less than we anticipated, and our supply chain and in-restaurant initiatives begin to offset the increase in usage from last year. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high 29% range as the mix benefit from Chipotle Honey Chicken will be more than offset by higher inflation across several items, the normalization of avocado prices and the impact of the newly enacted tariffs, including aluminum and the broad-based 10% tariff. We estimate these tariffs will ongoing impact of about 50 basis points and due to inventory on hand we anticipate a 20 basis point impact in Q2, which is included in our guidance. These estimates do not include any impact from the tariffs that were postponed or the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada since our imports fall under the U.S. MCA exemption.\nRegarding the 60 basis point investment that we made in 2024 to ensure system and generous portions, we estimate that we have offset more than half of the impact from supply chain savings as well as improved execution in our restaurants. We continue to anticipate a full offset by the back half of the year through several in-restaurant initiatives, including the produce slices.\nWe still anticipate underlying lost sales inflation to be in the low single-digit range for the full year, which excludes the normalization of avocado prices, the mix impact from LTOs, a portion investment and any impact from tariffs.\nLabor costs for the [ 25% ], an increase of about 60 basis points from last year, primarily driven by lower volumes as leverage from price offset wage inflation. For Q2, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid-24% range with wage inflation single-digit range as we have now lapped the 20% step-up in California wages from April of last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.4%, an increase of about 10 basis points from last year, primarily driven over volumes as leverage from pricing offset underlying inflation across a number of items, most notably utilities.\nMarketing and promo costs were 3% of sales in Q1 of about 10 basis points from last year. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to be in the mid-2% range with the full year in the high 2% range which includes the incremental spend for our Summer Mark plant. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 13% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $173 on a GAAP basis or $161 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $12 million related to equity awards granted last year for retention of key executives. G&A also includes $133 million in underlying G&A, $23 million related to noncash stock compensation, which included a reduction in our performance share accruals, $2 million related to payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises partially offset by bonus accruals and $3 million related to our field leadership conference, which was held in March of this year.\nWe expect our underlying G&A to around $135 million in Q2 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate the second quarter G&A will also include around $36 million in stock compensation, while this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. Offset by $3 million in lower bonus accruals, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q2 to around $168 million.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $87 million or 3% of sales. For 2025, we expect it to remain around 3% of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.9% for GAAP and 22.7% for non-GAAP benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above grant values. For 2025, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on these items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt. During the quarter, we purchased $554 million of our stock at an average price of $54.15, and we will continue to opportunistically purchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $400 million to our share purchase authorization. And at the end of the quarter, we have $875 million remaining.\nTo close, I would like to thank our 130,000 team members for your focus on being guest obsessed and earning every transaction, which is more important than ever in a challenged consumer environment. We are in a fortunate position with an industry-leading economic model, an exceptional value proposition and a fortressed balance sheet, which enables us to continue to invest in what makes Chipotle such a special brand and enable our long-term growth. I'm confident that we have a strong plan for the remainder of the year and look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.\nAnd with that, we can open to question and answers."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nPlease see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer. After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Boatwright\n\nInterim Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. I speak on behalf of everyone at Chipotle when I say that we are deeply sad by the devastation caused by the recent wildfires in Southern California. The safety of our restaurant teams and guests is a top priority. Unfortunately, I'm pleased to report that our team members are safe and the impact of our business has been minimal. In response to this tragedy, Chipotle has provided thousands of burritos to firefighters and first responders, committed $1 million in free meals to those impacted as well as made donations through our cultivate foundation to charitable organizations aiding in the relief efforts. We also featured the American Red Cross in our app to provide our guests a way to donate by rounding up their change.\nI want to thank our employees and our guests for helping to support the recovery efforts in the affected communities. Now turning to our business update. Chipotle had another outstanding year, delivering strong transaction-driven comps each quarter, expanding margins, opening over 300 restaurants, gaining momentum in key industry-leading brand metrics, making progress on many back-of-house initiatives and building our footprint internationally. For the fiscal year 2024, sales grew about 15% to reach $11.3 billion driven by a 7.4% comp, including over 5% transaction growth. Digital sales of $3.9 billion represented 35% of sales. AUVs Increased to $3.2 million. The restaurant level margin was 26.7%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.12, representing 24% growth over last year, and we opened a record 304 new restaurants, including 257 Chipotlanes.\nOur fourth quarter results were also impressive, especially considering that we are lapping the very successful carne asada limited time offer from last year. Additionally, we experienced some volatility around the December holidays, which we believe was impacted by the calendar shifts this year. Despite this, we were able to grow transactions by 4% in the quarter driven by continued improvement in throughput as well as the successful rollout of Brisket as a limited time offer. For the fourth quarter, sales grew over 13% to reach $2.8 billion driven by a 5.4% comp. Digital sales were 34% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24.8%, a decline of 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.25 and representing 19% growth over last year, and we opened 119 restaurants, including 95 Chipotlanes.\nConsidering our underlying trends as well as our incremental throughput opportunity and strong marketing plan, we believe we can continue to drive positive transaction comps in 2025 and and anticipate annual comps to be in the low to mid-single-digit range.\nAdam will provide more details on this in just a few minutes. Now before I dive into an update on our strategies, I want to take a minute to share a key takeaway from our Leadership Summit we held in November. Important theme we are prioritizing is to be guest obsessed. I want to make sure that as we continue to scale Chipotle, everything we do is in service of our guests or those who serve our guests. This will require an understanding and a focus on how each role in the organization matters up to making the experience in our restaurants better every day. A guest obsessed mindset is crucial to ensuring that we continue to deliver against our 5 key strategies that help us win today while we grow the future. And these strategies include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity of delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.\nAmplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain, making the brand visible, relevant and love to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level and expanding access and convenience by accelerating our restaurant openings in North America and internationally. I will start with our operations and our focus on throughput. One key driver of running successful restaurants is an experienced general manager who understands the importance of throughput and and can train and develop the crude to execute the 4 pillars consistently every day.\nThe good news is our GM turnover continued to improve in 2024 and is among the lowest levels in the company's history. More stability among our GMs results in more stability in our restaurants and stability, coupled with consistent training and reps has been a big driver of the progress we have seen. In 2024, throughput improved by about 2 entrees in the peak 15-minute period, and we achieved our near-term goal to reach the mid-20s. Our support centers and restaurant leadership teams continue to find ways to improve our ability to execute the 4 pillars. For example, our weekly throughput reviews conducted across our restaurant support centers, help to keep us top of mind and give our restaurant leaders information to provide coaching and feedback to drive improvement as well as celebrate excellence. We also made the decision last quarter to have the manager on duty responsible for the expo position, and this helped to improve the percentage of restaurants with an expo in place to over 60%. While I'm thrilled to see the progress we are making, we still have work to do and throughput remains one of our biggest priorities and opportunities in 2025.\nOne of the important unlocks this year will be our focus on modernizing the back of house to improve the team member experience and the speed and simplicity of prep while maintaining our high culinary standards. This will ensure more restaurants complete prep on time, which will enable better execution of the 4 pillars during peak periods, and this brings me to amplifying technology. We have several innovative tools that we are testing to improve the process. As we mentioned last quarter, we are currently in the middle of rolling out the produce slicers to all restaurants and expect the rollout to be complete by this summer. Fresh shop produce in our restaurants each day is key to maintaining our high culinary standards. But it's also one of the most time-consuming tasks. The slicer improves the experience for our team members by reducing the time to chop produce and improve the culinary by ensuring consistent cut sizes.\nAs we have mentioned in the past, some of the efficiencies from the produce slice will help offset the investment we made last year, ensuring generous portion sizes. Over the last several months, we also began a new initiative in a patch of restaurants to better understand the synergistic benefits of installing the produce slicer, the dual-sided plancha the 3 pain rice cooker and the dual VAT fryer in the same restaurant. As a reminder, the dual-sided plancha cooks the chicken and steak and under half the time it takes on the traditional plancha with the same [ car and car ] and better consistency and juiciness. The news rice cooker eliminates the large rice pots and cooks the rice on the pan that you see on the line which creates more consistent quality and streamlines the rice cooking process. And the dual back prior doubles the capacity for frying our chips resulting in better quality and reducing the time it takes while ensuring consistent availability.\nBased on the initial results, we have decided to roll out all 4 pieces of equipment to new restaurant openings beginning later this year. And as we gain more data and insights into this initiative, we will determine if and how we roll out more broadly to existing restaurants. This is a great example of how we're beginning to look at our tools and processes and conventions holistically rather than as bolt-on additions. The end goal is to improve the experience for our teams by making tasks easier to execute, more efficient, faster and more consistent while maintaining our high culinary standards. We are also pursuing long-term innovations through our stage gate process, including Autocado, our device that cuts cores and scoops avocados and our augmented digital make line, both of which are being evaluated on a test basis. While it is early in our learnings on these opportunities, we are making progress and remain optimistic about each of these innovative tools. When we improve the experience for our restaurant teams, it ladders to a better guest experience. exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, coupled with our powerful marketing strategy to make the brand more visible, more relevant and more love builds the brand momentum and results year after year of transaction growth.\nOur marketing strategy in 2024 was nothing short of exceptional with a strong brand campaign and 2 very successful limited time offers, including Chicken al Pastor and Brisket. Both of which surpassed our expectations and drove incremental transactions and spend. This helped to further strengthen our brand as we ended the year leading and gaining momentum in important categories like high-quality ingredients, value for the money, healthy nutritious, good amount of food for the money and brand I love, and we have a strong plan for 2025 to keep the momentum going. We started off the year by putting a spotlight on our lifestyle bulls and to encourage and reward healthy habits among our guests in North America and Europe and our second partnership with Strava the app for active people with over 135 million users in more than 190 countries. With health and wellness top of mind for our guests, that's a great way to show how the Chipotle ingredients can be customized to fit and fuel any dietary restrictions or lifestyle routines.\nAdditionally, I think it's no secret that our Chipotle Honey Chicken pilot was a success. That was our best-performing limited-time offer, both in early sensory testing as well as the broader 2 market tests and you will see in our restaurants in the near future. We will also continue to reinforce our brand story of high-quality, responsibly sourced ingredients, made fresh every day through our behind the oil advertising campaign. This campaign, which features our real teams preparing our delicious food has certainly resonated with our guests who are not just buying our brand but buying into our brand and our purpose to cultivate a better world. Speaking of our teams, last year was another tremendous year of opportunities in growth with over 23,000 people promoted, of which over 85% of all restaurant management roles or internal promotions. We also promoted 3 regional vice presidents who started as crew members, and now 5 of our 11 regional vice presidents started his crew and worked our way up to the highest level of operations. managing a region of the country with sales over $1 billion. Collectively, these 5 RVPs have over 100 years of experience at Chipotle.\nTo be promoted to an RVP, not only do they need to run a successful subregion, but they also needed to show the ability to develop and grow future leaders. And these 5 have developed and promoted over 30 team directors nearly 100 field leaders and hundreds of general managers. These are life-changing careers for the RVPs as well as the leaders they are developing along the way. I think this is a testament to our leadership development capabilities as an organization, which I couldn't be prouder of. At the end of the day, our business wins when we lean into the growth and development of all Chipotle team members.\nFinally, moving to expanding access. 2024 was another outstanding year with 304 new restaurant openings, including 257 Chipotlanes, making it a second year in a row of record openings. We continue to anticipate between 315 and 345 new openings in 2025 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. I'm excited to share that we recently surpassed our 1,000 Chipotlane, and now this drive-thru format makes up over 25% of our restaurants. On average, the Chipotlane takes less than 30 seconds to complete the order pickup process. The added convenience has been incremental as Chipotlanes continue to generate better revenues, margins and returns than non-Chipotlanes opened at the same time. It can also be seen in the mix of business as Chipotlanes have a larger pickup mix, mostly offset by a lower delivery mix. Shifting to outside the U.S. We now have 85 international restaurants, including 55 in Canada, 27 in Europe and 3 in the Middle East. As we mentioned last quarter, we're proving that Chipotle resonates across geographies. And and we will accelerate growth in Canada and the Middle East in 2025. We will also continue to make progress on proving out the economic model in Europe and begin to build a pipeline for growth.\nTo conclude, 2024 was a new year of milestones, including growing transactions over 5% and surpassing $3.2 million in AUV, reaching 1,000 Chipotlanes opening our first restaurants to Middle East and making tremendous progress in Europe. I want to thank our 130,000 employees for your hard work last year. The amount of talent and passion we have is more than most businesses could ever hope for. I don't take that for granted and I'm proud to be a part of this great organization that prioritizes our people and their growth. And we continue to have so much growth in front of us as we aim to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America grow our AUVs beyond $4 million, expand margins and make progress toward becoming a global iconic brand. This will require exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput and a commitment to being guest obsessed. I'm confident that we have the right team to achieve these ambitious goals and that the best is yet to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Adam.\n\nAdam Rymer\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew over 13% year-over-year to reach $2.8 billion. As comp sales grew 5.4%, driven by 4% transaction growth. Our comp included a negative 20 basis point true-up related to our loyalty program. As a reminder, in Q4 of each year, we reevaluate the estimated breakage or loyalty points that will expire. And this year, we decreased our estimate due to higher member engagement. Restaurant-level margin of 24.8% declined about 60 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share was $0.24 on a GAAP basis and $0.25 on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted for unusual items, representing 19% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, transaction comps were positive in all months driven by the launch of Brisket and continued improvement in throughput.\nAs Scott mentioned, we experienced softer trends around the holidays in late December, which we believe was due to Christmas and New Year's falling in the middle of each week. Comps have been volatile so far in 2025 with weather having a larger impact on our sales than what we experienced last year. While we believe underlying transaction trends are healthy and we have a strong plan for the year, we do compare against progressively tougher comps in the first half of the year and therefore, are guiding to a low to mid-single-digit comp for the full year. There are also a couple of factors to keep in mind when you think about the full year.\nIn the second quarter, we will be rolling off about 90 basis points of pricing in April when we lap the pricing we took last year in California to offset the step-up in wages. And Easter will fall back into the second quarter this year, which will negatively impact Q2 comps by about 100 basis points, with no net benefit in the first quarter because of leap day in the prior year. I will now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.4%, an increase of about 70 basis points from last year. The benefit of our menu price increase was more than offset by higher usage as we focused on ensuring consistent and generous portions as well as the mix impact from our premium smoked risk an LTO and inflation across several items, most notably avocados and dairy. Relative to our guidance, avocados were favorable as the year-over-year step-up was less than we anticipated.\nFor Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high 29% range as pricing leverage and the benefit from Brisket ramping down will be partially offset by higher costs across several items, most notably avocados and chicken. Our guidance does not include the impact of the new tariffs on items imported from Mexico, Canada and China. We source about 2% of our sales from Mexico, which includes avocados, tomatoes, lines and peppers. And less than 0.5% of our sales from Canada and China. If the recently announced tariffs go into full effect, it would have an ongoing impact of about 60 basis points on our cost of sales. Also, we remain confident that we can offset the 60 basis point portion investment we made in 2024. Recently, we have started to see the impact eased slightly as we expected.\nAnd we will offset the remainder through efficiencies we have identified within our supply chain as well as several end restaurant initiatives, including the produce slicers. While we expect to realize some of the benefit in the first half of the year, we don't anticipate a full offset until the second half of 2025. Finally, underlying cost of sales inflation is expected to be in the low single-digit range for the first quarter and for the full year, which excludes the normalization of avocado prices, the mix impact from LTOs, the portion investment and any impact from tariffs. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.2%, an increase of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage was offset by wage inflation.\nFor Q1, we expect our labor cost to be in the high 24% range with wage inflation in the mid-single-digit range. We anticipate wage inflation will step down to the low single-digit range in Q2 and for the remainder of the year when we lap the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California that went into effect in April of last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.5% a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage and a lower delivery mix, partially offset by a true-up in insurance reserves. Marketing and promo costs were 3% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in below 3% range with the full year to come in the mid-2% range. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $191 million on a GAAP basis or $175 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $12 million related to equity awards granted for retention of key executives and a $4 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also included $133 million in underlying G&A, $32 million related to noncash stock compensation related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $2 million related to our upcoming field leadership conference, which is scheduled in Q1 for this year.\nWe expect our underlying G&A to be around $135 million in Q1 and will step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate first quarter G&A will also include around $33 million in stock-based compensation, although this amount could move up or down based off our actual performance and is subject to the final 2025 grants, which are issued in Q1. We around $8 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, and $3 million for costs associated with our biannual field leadership conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $179 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $84 million or 2.9% of sales. For 2025, we expect it to remain around 3% of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 24.4% for GAAP and 24.6% for non-GAAP and benefited from a reduction in nondeductible expenses.\nFor 2025, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt. During the fourth quarter, we purchased $331 million of our stock at an average price of $59.83. For the full year, we purchased nearly $1 million at an average price of $57.21. And going forward, we will continue to opportunistically purchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $300 million to our share purchase authorization. And at the end of the quarter, we have just over $1 billion remaining.\nTo close, I want to thank our 130,000 employees for all your hard work and dedicated in delivering an exceptional experience for our guests each and every day. This powers our strong economic model that we continue to protect and grow and allows us to invest back into Chipotle by growing our footprint and furthering our purpose of cultivating a better world. We have a strong plan for 2025, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.\nAnd with that, let's open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin discussing our results, I need to recognize and congratulate Jack Hartung on his nearly 25 years with Chipotle and roughly 80 earnings calls with all of you. I want to thank him for being a great friend, a terrific leader and a champion for our purpose and brand. I'll say a few more words about Jack and Adam before I hand it over to him. .\nNow turning to our results. The second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited time offer drove strong demand to our restaurants. Additionally, our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the stronger demand trends with terrific service and speed in -- driving over an 8% transaction comp in the quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 18% to reach nearly $3 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp. In-store sales grew by 24% over last year. Digital sales represented 35% of sales, restaurant level margin was 28.9%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.34, representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 53 new restaurants, including 46 Chipotlanes.\nBefore I give an update on our 5 key strategies, I want to take a minute to address the portion concerns that have been brought up in social media. First, there was never a directive to provide less to our customers. Generous portion is a core brand equity of Chipotle. It always has been, and it always will be. With that said, getting the feedback caused us to relook at our execution across our entire system with the intention to always serve our guests delicious, fresh, custom burritos and bowls with generous portions. To be more consistent across all 3,500 restaurants, we have focused in on those with outlier portion scores based on consumer surveys, and we are reemphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly. We have also leaned in and reemphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants as it is a core brand equity of Chipotle. Our guests expect this now more than ever, and we are committed to making this investment to reinforce that Chipotle stands for a generous amount of delicious, fresh food at fair prices for every customer, every visit.\nThe good news is that we are already beginning to see our actions positively reflected in our consumer scores and our value proposition remains very strong. We believe our focus on operations, including throughput as well as terrific marketing and menu innovation, have strengthened the brand and our value proposition. And we will continue to listen to and treasure our guests to earn every transaction.\nNow I will turn to our 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level, making the brand visible relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain and expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\nFirst, I will start with running successful restaurants. As I mentioned, the improvements we have seen in throughput positions us well to meet the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter, driven by what we call burrito season or our peak seasonality as well as the success of Chicken al Pastor. We often are asked why throughput is such an important operational KPI for Chipotle. So I thought I would begin by expanding on this. It is the outcome of a strong operational engine that delivers a great experience for our teams and our guests. In order to deliver exceptional throughput, our restaurants need to be fully staffed and properly deployed. Our crew needs to complete all food prep on time and they need to be well trained to execute the 4 pillars. This results in a better overall experience for our crew, which leads to more stability and, therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And for our guests, faster lines with hotter, fresher food. This type of guest experience strengthens our value proposition and drive incremental transactions. Over the last year, we have improved our tools and training to deliver exceptional throughput. This included rightsizing the cadence of digital orders during peak periods and enabling our restaurants to see in real time at the point of sale, the number of entrees in each 15-minute interval. This has received tremendous feedback from our restaurant teams. It has helped to accelerate momentum as it creates excitement and allows our teams to celebrate in a moment when they achieve their goal. And our GMs can coach in the moment when they fall short. In fact, one of our field leaders in New York have 5 of his 8 restaurants achieved their throughput goal in the second quarter, which compares to just one of his restaurants a year ago.\nWhile we are seeing progress, we still have a lot of opportunity to increase the percentage of restaurants executing the 4 pillars. Expo is a great example as it is the most impactful pillar. As a reminder, Expo is the crew member between Salsa and Kash, who helps expedite the bagging and payment process. restaurants within Expo in place are averaging 5 incremental entrees in their peak 15 minutes, yet we only see a little over half of our restaurants with Expo in place during peak periods. This is certainly better than where it was a couple of quarters ago, but it should be a lot higher. The good news is that I strongly believe we have the right leaders in training in place to keep the momentum going as we continue to gather the data on the execution of the 4 pillars and provide feedback and coaching on a weekly basis, I am confident throughput can go much higher.\nThis brings me to world-class people leadership. As we mentioned last quarter, crew and GM turnover is at some of the best levels I've seen since I joined the company. And the stability is allowing us to develop and grow our people pipeline to achieve our goal of promoting over 90% from within. We have many inspiring stories at Chipotle of crew members who have grown with the company to become some of our top leaders. In fact, our recently promoted regional Vice President started as a crew member 25 years ago. She moved to the United States at 14 years old without knowing English. At 19, she started working at Chipotle and has moved her way up, including spending time in a language development role supporting other employees at Chipotle to learn English as a second language. Her people-first mentality is what has made her so successful at hiring, developing and retaining many of our best leaders. And she has 2 sisters that have each been with Chipotle for over 15 years and our top-performing field leaders. With the addition of her role, we now have 3 of our 10 regional vice presidents who started as crew members and have made their way up to leading a region and managing over a $1 billion business. These stories really do inspire our entire organization as the opportunity to develop and grow within Chipotle, along with our industry leading benefits and pay, enables us to attract and retain exceptional people. In fact, as we look to expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America, we will be adding an RVP nearly every year along with hundreds of restaurant leadership roles.\nFinally, our 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history, enables our employees and others to purchase whole shares at more affordable prices and gives us more flexibility to compensate our top performers in stock, all with the goal to have more employees participate in the financial success of our company. It really is an exciting time to be part of Chipotle.\nNow turning to marketing. The Chipotle brand continues to gain momentum as we focus on exceptional operations and making the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved. Chicken al Pastor is a great example as it once again surpassed our expectations, reaching over a 20% incidence rate and more importantly, driving incremental transactions and spend. Similar to carne asada, we proved that when we bring back a limited time offer, we were able to make it more delicious with seamless execution. And while Chicken al Pastor will end later this summer, I am excited to share that we will be bringing back smoke brisket this fall for a limited time. Brisket was among the most requested in many items as our guests love the combination of smoke beef chart on the grill and finish with the brisket as me with smoky chile peppers. It took a huge cross-functional effort across supply chain, culinary finance and marketing to bring back this delicious LTO.\nOur marketing team also continues to find creative ways to generate excitement and drive more engagement around our annual promotions. In the second quarter, we had a record-breaking National Burrito Day, where our gamified promotion resulted in Chipotle's best sales and digital sales day ever. It also drove an influx of new and lapsed customers and was the best enrollment day of the year for our rewards program. I'm also thrilled to share that later this week, team Chipotle will be visible on the world stage as we leverage our real food for real athletes platform for those competing in Paris. We highlighted the inspiring journeys of Anthony Edwards, Sofia Smith, Taylor Fritz, Sarah Hughes and Jager Eaton. Their go to Chipotle meals and how our ingredients have been a key component of their training regimens. We will also bring back our gold foil for burritos for a limited time in both North America and France to celebrate all the athletes competing.\nShifting to technology and innovation. I want to provide an update on a few of our in-restaurant initiatives starting with the dual side of Grill. Over the last year, the Grill has been in 10 restaurants, and we have received consistent feedback that our teams and our guests love it. The grill can cook the chicken and steak in under half the time it takes on the Plancha with consistent execution and the same [indiscernible]. It also maintains better moisture resulting in juicier chicken and steak with less waste. And for our teams, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improves the learning curve.\nFinally, for high-volume restaurants, it opens up capacity and drives efficiency during morning prep as chicken and steak can be closer to serving. We are in the process of rolling out the dual sided grill to an additional 74 high-volume restaurants this year, and we'll continue to evaluate the economics prior to rolling it out further across the organization. Additionally, our automated digital make line in Autocado are making their way through final checks ahead of being pilot tested in their first restaurant. Our food safety and operation teams have worked closely with our technology teams to assure that the design takes into account things like cleaning, speed and accuracy as well as maintaining our high culinary standards.\nThe next step will be to get each device into a restaurant to continue to learn and iterate as part of our stage gate process. I'm excited about each of these initiatives, and I strongly believe we will see some impactful back-of-house changes in the years to come, that will help to improve consistency in our restaurants and drive a better overall experience for our teams and our guests.\nI'm also proud Chipotle continues to be a learning organization. Using the stage gate process is our way to drive discipline around what ultimately gets rolled out. I'm confident this process will further strengthen Chipotle as a leader in technology and innovation.\nNow moving to our final strategy, which is to expand access and convenience. In North America, we remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, and our openings remain strong across all markets. While our time lines remain consistent to last quarter, our development team continues to see groundbreaks meaningfully higher compared to last year. which should help smooth the cadence of openings as we get into the back half of the year.\nI also wanted to share an update on our partnership with the Alshaya Group. Our first restaurant in Kuwait has been open for several months and continues to have strong performance. The good news is that the feedback from guests is that the culinary experience is right on par with North America, which is fantastic to hear. It also tells me that when we execute our culinary and deliver an exceptional experience for our guests, Chipotle's brand resonates across geographies. We look forward to opening our second restaurant in Kuwait as well as expanding into Dubai with the Alshaya Group later this year.\nTo close, our crew members, GMs and field leadership delivered an excellent second quarter helped by our committed support centers that enable restaurants to better succeed. We are very fortunate to have a clear purpose and an organization that is full of talented people at all levels. It is exciting to see the progress we have made so far, and I am confident there is much more growth in front of us.\nFinally, I want to spend a few minutes reflecting on my time with Jack and his extraordinary 25 years at Chipotle. Jack is just as passionate about our brand and our purpose as he is about protecting our economic model. I know you all agree with me that he is one of the best CFOs in the business and has played an instrumental role in growing Chipotle from under 200 restaurants to over 3,500 restaurants, investing in our premium ingredients, and supply chain, protecting our exceptional value proposition and delivering industry-leading economics and returns. As Jack always says, these 3 characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate, premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. Beyond that, he has developed an exceptional finance team, including Adam Rimer, who will become our next Chief Financial Officer. Over the last 15 years, Adam has reported directly or indirectly to and been mentored by Jack in preparation for this role. And importantly, he is just as passionate about our brand, our purpose and protecting our economic model. I'm highly confident he is the right leader to become our next CFO, and that it will be a smooth transition. So again, thank you, Jack, for your friendship, leadership and so many contributions to Chipotle.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nChief Financial Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, for those kind words. I'm extremely fortunate to have had the privilege and honor to serve Chipotle, our employees and our shareholders for all these years. While retiring was one of the hardest decisions, it was also one of the easiest I've ever had to make. It was hard because Chipotle is a special brand, a special company and it's full of special people. But it was also easy because I know Chipotle is in great hands with a family of smart, talented people who are committed to our purpose to cultivate a better world. It's also easy because I have a large and growing extended family, and I treasure the time I get to spend with every one of them, and now we'll have the chance to enjoy even more special experiences with them. I'm delighted that Adam Rimer will be our next CFO, and as Brian mentioned, Adam has worked with me for 15 years, and I can tell you he's a very talented leader who knows our brand and our business well, and I'm confident in his ability to help lead Chipotle to the next level. In addition, Jamie McConnell will be elevated to our Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer. And since joining Chipotle 6 years ago, Jamie has provided great leadership, built strong teams and is well prepared to serve in our new role.\nWith that said, I'll turn now to our quarterly results. Sales in the second quarter grew 18.2% year-over-year to reach about $3 billion as comp sales grew 11.1%, driven by 8.7% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 28.9% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $0.34, representing 36% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to unrealized loss on investment and an increase in legal reserves, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.01, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $0.33.\nSales comps were highest in April, driven by the Easter shift, a strong reaction to the return of Chicken al Pastor and several successful activations, including National Burrito day. Comps settled back to around 6% in June, and continue to be driven by positive transactions. July has been more difficult to read so far due to the 4th holiday, weather disruptions in Texas and the impact from a recent technology outage, but we believe the underlying trend remains similar to June. We are maintaining our full year comp guidance of mid- to high single digit. And as a reminder, we will roll off about 3 points of pricing in early Q4 as we lap our menu price increase from last year.\nBefore I go through the individual P&L line items, I want to give an overview of what to anticipate. We expect our margins will be under pressure for the next couple of quarters. Most, if not all of this pressure is seasonal, temporary, or it's an investment that we can offset through efficiencies, and we believe our industry-leading margin structure is still intact. I'll now go through each of the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.4% in line with last year. Benefit of last year's menu price increase was offset by inflation in avocados, increased oil usage and higher incidence of beef as a result of the continued success of Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative.\nFor Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be just below 31%. About 1/3 of the step-up is due to the higher protein costs as we roll out Chicken al Pastor and then launched Smoke Brisket later in the quarter. About 1/3 is due to an uptick in dairy and avocado prices and the final 1/3 are about 40 to 60 basis points is an investment we are making as we focus on outlier restaurants to ensure correct and generous portion. We expect this investment will ease from these levels somewhat. We also believe that we can offset the remaining investment with efficiencies and innovation over time. While avocado prices are higher than the very favorable levels we have seen over the past several quarters, this is in line with our expectations from earlier this year.\nAdditionally, we are less impacted by the recent volatility in the Mexican avocado market as our supply chain team has done a fantastic job of diversifying our exposure. And in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados come from Peru. Outside of avocados and the protein mix shift, we anticipate underlying cost of sales inflation will be in the low single digits range for the remainder of the year. Labor cost for the quarter was 24.1%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation. For Q3, we expect our labor cost to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales with wage inflation to remain at about 6%. And as a reminder, about half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California as a result of the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 12.9%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.1% of sales in Q2. And in Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the low 2% range with the full year to be in the high 2% range. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 13% range due to seasonally lower sales and higher seasonal expenses like utilities and maintenance and repair. Based on these expectations provided, we anticipate restaurant level margin to be around 25% in Q3. As I mentioned earlier, some of the pressure is seasonal, like the shift from Chicken al Pastor to Brisket. Some is temporary like the higher prices in avocados and dairy, which if they persist, we can address with menu prices over time. And finally, we're confident that the investment we're making to ensure we are delivering correct and generous portions can be offset by efficiencies and innovation over time.\nG&A for the quarter was $175 million on a GAAP basis or about $171 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $122 million in underlying G&A, $43 million related to noncash stock compensation and $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $128 million in Q3 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people to support ongoing growth. Anticipated stock comp will be around $40 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual results. We also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $175 million.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $84 million or 2.8% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Effective tax rate for Q2 was 25% for GAAP as well as for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above the grant value. And for fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range thought it may vary based on discrete items. On June 26, we successfully completed our 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. During the quarter, we repurchased $151 million of our stock at an average price of $63.52. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $650 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 53 new restaurants in the second quarter, of which 46 at Chipotle. We continue to anticipate opening between 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having at Chipotle, and we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen.\nTo close, I also want to thank our employees for all their hard work in driving our strong results and for continuing to build and grow Chipotle. I also want to reflect how our historic 50-for-1 stock split. When Chipotle went public at $22 per share, I was very optimistic that we have a special brand with a tremendous growth opportunity. I'm not sure I could have ever imagined then that we would split the shares at just over $3,200 per share, but I did envision that we would reach over 3,000 restaurants as we have today in the U.S. And today, I know we have a special brand with industry-leading economics and returns. I'm also just as optimistic about our growth opportunity to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America and to expand internationally. And as we further our purpose of cultivating a better world, we'll continue to drive extraordinary value for our guests, our employees and our shareholders. It's truly an exciting time to be part of this purpose-driven company with seemingly limitless opportunity.\nAnd with that, I'll open the lines to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Forms 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The momentum in the business continued in the first quarter as we delivered 7% comp sales growth driven by over 5% transaction growth. Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants as well as successful marketing campaigns, including spotlighting barbacoa and the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited-time offer.\nFor the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.7 billion driven by a 7% comp. In-store sales grew by 19% over last year as throughput reached the highest levels in 4 years. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $13.37, representing 27% growth over last year. And we opened 47 new restaurants, including 43 Chipotlanes.\npoint in our business has continued into April. And as a result, we are increasing our annual comp guidance and now estimate comps in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year.\nNow let me shift to an update on our 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; and technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; finally, exceptional world-class people leadership.\nLast month, we held our All Manager Conference, where we brought together 4,500 of our restaurant and support center leaders to celebrate their success as well as amplify our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. The conference included over 3,200 general managers, 100 apprentices, 450 field leaders, 60 team directors and 11 regional vice presidents.\nFor the first time, we also included crew members who have worked with us for over 20 years to celebrate their commitment and dedication to Chipotle. In fact, one of our general managers in attendance from Denver, Colorado has been with Chipotle for 23 years, and she also had 4 crew members from her restaurant, who have each been with the company for over 20 years. Collectively, that is over 100 years of Chipotle experience call it one restaurant, which is just incredible. And it is no surprise, this restaurant has fantastic operations with throughput that is outperforming the overall company.\nAt our conference, we highlighted the growth opportunity at Chipotle. To reach our long-term target over 7,000 restaurants in North America, we showed our teams that we will need to double the number of field leadership positions we have. And as we target over 90% internal promotions, the majority of these future leaders will come from the GMs and apprentices at this conference. This was a powerful and motivating message and one that is in to Chipotle given our scale, growth and company-owned model.\nAnd in connection with our 50:1 stock split, we also announced that all of our GMs as well as crew members who have been with Chipotle over 20 years will receive stock grants once the split is effective. This will allow them to participate in the financial success of the company. Bottom line, Chipotle is changing lives for the better. In fact, one of our restaurateurs and certified training managers spoke at the conference and shared that her experience at Chipotle helped her to overcome financial hardship. Now she was even on the verge of homelessness before she joined Chipotle. She started as a crew member over 10 years ago and has thrived, making her way to the highest-level GM and is well on her way to becoming a field leader. She was able to leverage our education benefits to earn a college degree, the first in her family. And utilizing the stock she received as a restaurateur, she was able to purchase her first. She is also one of our team members in our Behind the Foil commercials as she really is a great example of exceptional people that makes Chipotle Chipotle.\nIn addition to our world-class people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput are key areas of focus and are both critical to running our successful restaurants. We spent time at our All Manager Conference, reminding our teams about Chipotle's culture of Food with Integrity and how there's a direct connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. We showcased Chipotle's Food with Integrity journey and our strong partnerships with our farmers and suppliers who take special care in ensuring they are growing our food with the highest standards. We also emphasized the importance of teaching and tasting Chipotle, which means that our restaurant teams taste the food they prepare multiple times a day to assure it is delicious and meets our high standards. You see Chipotle was founded on this idea of real food and real culinary. It's not a marketing slogan or a short-term initiative. It's in our heritage. It's in our DNA. Our restaurant teams take pride our food in our healthy, high-quality eating experience adds value for our guests.\nIn addition to our delicious food, exceptional throughput or the speed of service in our restaurant also adds to the extraordinary value proposition we offer. I'm thrilled to share that the momentum and throughput continued to build in the first quarter as we improved by nearly 2 entrees in our peak 15 minutes compared to last year with each month showing an acceleration.\nAt our All Manager Conference, we also focused on coaching the nuances of great throughput or executing what we call the 4 pillars. This includes Expo or the crew member between saucing and cash to help expedite the bagging and payment process; linebacker, typically the manager on duty who supplies both lines with freshly prepared food so that the crew on our line can continue to serve our guests without interruption; meat and plus or another way of saying that everything that is needed for a lunch or dinner peak is ready and in its place; and ACE is in their places are having the best trained crew deployed in each position for lunch and dinner peaks.\nWe are in the early innings of consistently executing 4 pillars, but when we do, it creates a flywheel effect in our restaurants. The restaurants run more smoothly as our teams are properly trained and deployed, which allows them to keep up with demand without stress. This leads to more stability, and therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And this can be seen in our latest turnover data, which is at historically low levels.\nAnd for our guests, faster throughput results in shorter, faster-moving lines and hotter, fresher food, strengthening our value proposition and driving incremental transactions.\nOur restaurant in the Financial District in Boston is a great example where a year ago, they were doing mid-20 entrees in their peak 15 minutes. And today, they are doing over 40 entrees in their peak 15 minutes with days that can reach as high as 80, which is among the highest in the company. The restaurant has low turnover and outsized transaction growth, which clearly demonstrates they are creating a better overall experience in the restaurant.\nNow turning to marketing. Our marketing team has started the year off strong with outstanding brand advertising and menu innovation. We have continued our successful Behind the Foil brand campaign, showing our real teams prepping our delicious fresh food by hand every day, reinforcing a key differentiator for Chipotle. This ran across all media channels, including high-profile placements in television, such as college football and the NFL Playoffs. We also began to promote our delicious barbacoa as we leveraged our consumer insights that told us that many of our guests did not know that barbacoa was braised beef. So we renamed it Braised Beef Barbacoa and emphasized the culinary recipe, which is slow-cooked, responsibly raised beef seasoned with garlic and cumene and hand-shredded. It was Chipotle's best-kept secret and is now growing in popularity.\nThe campaign was a success, driving incremental transactions and spend, and it was simple for our operations team to execute since it was an existing menu item. This is a perfect example of how our marketing team continues to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved.\nDuring the quarter, we also brought back one of our most requested new menu items, Chicken al Pastor. Our guests loved our spin on the al Pastor using our adobo chicken, Morita peppers with a splash of pineapple, fresh lime and hand-chopped cilantro. Similar to carne asada, when we bring back a past favorite, we are able to improve the entire experience as we leverage our know-how across culinary, supply chain, marketing and operations to make it more delicious with seamless execution. Chicken al Pastor is off to a great start once again, driving incremental transactions into our restaurants.\nMoving on to technology and innovation. Our marketing and digital teams continue to grow and evolve our rewards program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary. It is exciting that we now have a digital reach of about 40 million Rewards members that we can leverage to increase engagement. Through our marketing initiatives, we continue to find successful ways to drive enrollments, and we are leveraging our digital team to create a seamless app experience and deliver more relevant journeys for our Rewards members. The goal is to drive higher engagement in the program, which results in higher frequency and spend over time.\nIn our restaurants, we continue to explore technology tools that drive higher productivity and improve the overall experience for our teams. This includes things like forecasting and deploying labor, recruiting new crew members, preparing our fresh food and automating the preparation of digital orders. In fact, at our All Manager Conference, we showed our teams the latest version of our automated digital makeline and Autocado, which cuts cores and peels avocados. And as we discussed last quarter, we are excited to get both into a restaurant later this year as part of the stage process.\nOur final strategic priority is expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. We remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, mostly in North America. We continue to see strength in openings across geographies and location types, including urban, suburban and small towns. Additionally, our development team is making progress to smooth the cadence of openings throughout the year with the number of restaurants under construction up meaningfully to last year.\nOutside of North America, I'm delighted to share that we opened our first restaurant in Kuwait with the Alshaya Group, which marks the first time we've entered a new country in over 10 years. This was a highly collaborative effort between the Alshaya Group and our Chipotle teams across culinary, food safety, development operations and supply chain to successfully launch Chipotle in a brand-new market with the same food quality standards and customer experience that we have in North America. Although it is very early, the opening was strong, and we look forward to continued success in many restaurants across the region with the Alshaya Group.\nMoving to Europe. As you may recall, we brought over one of our top operators about a year ago, who helped to identify areas of opportunity, including better aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our North American operations where it makes sense and is feasible. We have made nice progress aligning the culinary and are beginning to better align the operations, including a recent change in leadership structure as we expand the role of our Canadian leader to oversee both Canada and Europe.\nOver the last 5 years, Canada's economics have improved to be on par with the U.S. In fact, Canada is leading our company in many key operational KPIs, including throughput. The successful approach of aligning the local strategy with our overall operational vision and diligently overseeing execution of Chipotle standards has set up Canada for rapid expansion.\nWe see many similarities between the European operation today and the Canadian operation 5 years ago. The new leadership team in Europe, including 2 top operators from the U.S., will take a similar strategic approach to improve economics and unlock Europe's growth potential.\nIn closing, the strength in our business, including transaction-driven comps, is due to the collective hard work of our 120,000 employees, who are results-driven, passionate about our purpose of cultivating a better world and excited for our growth opportunities ahead. At our All Manager Conference, I highlighted the importance of people development as it represents one of our greatest strengths. Seeing our leaders all in one place was inspiring, and their personal growth stories are real and a key ingredient to Chipotle's success and future growth. This makes me more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term goals of more than doubling our restaurants in North America and expanding internationally. As I've said in the past, I believe the next Chipotle is Chipotle.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nChief Financial Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion as sales comp grew 7% driven by over 5% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 27.5% [ and ] about 190 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $13.37, representing 27% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to an increase in legal reserves.\nAs Brian mentioned, based on our strong underlying transaction trends, we are raising our full year comp guidance to the mid- to high single-digit range. We anticipate second quarter comps to be the highest of the year, which includes a benefit of an extra day from the Easter ship, and we anticipate comps to continue to be driven by transactions in the back half of the year. We do have some challenging rollover components, including Chicken al Pastor ending, lapping our menu price increase from the prior year and rolling over the very successful carne asada campaign. With that said, we have a strong plan in place for the back half both in terms of operations and marketing.\nAdditionally, in April, minimum wage in California for restaurant companies like ours increased to $20 an hour. As a result, our wages in California went up by nearly 20%, and we subsequently took a 6% to 7% menu price increase in our California restaurants just to cover the cost in dollar terms. This will add almost 1 full point to total company pricing beginning in Q2. California restaurant cash flow is below the company average. So this increase will allow us to maintain cash flow. However, it will have a negative impact to overall company restaurant-level margin by about 20 basis points.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 28.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily beef and produce, and a protein mix headwind and from the successful beef barbacoa marketing initiative. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to be in the mid-29% range due to higher prices across several items, but most notably avocados as we anticipate a step-up from the low levels we have seen over the past several quarters. We anticipate cost of sales inflation will be in the mid-single-digit range for the remainder of this year.\nLabor costs for the quarter were [ 24.1% ], a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation and the higher performance-based compensation. For Q2, we expect our labor costs to stay in the mid-24% range with wage inflation stepping up to about 6% as a result of the minimum wage increase in California. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage, lower delivery expenses and lower marketing and promo costs.\nMarketing and promo costs were 2.9% of sales in Q1, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 2% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 13% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $204 million on a GAAP basis or $191 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $13 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $126 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to noncash stock comp, $21 million related to our successful All Manager Conference held in March and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vestings and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $129 million in Q2 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $36 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.\nWe also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our total anticipated G&A in Q2 to around $171 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $83 million or 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants.\nOur effective tax rate for Q1 was 22% for GAAP and 22.1% for non-GAAP. And our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above grant values. For fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOn March 19, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors. Pending shareholder approval in early June to increase the number of authorized shares, the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Wednesday, June 26.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. As a result of the timing of our announcement of the stock split, we were unable to repurchase shares for most of the quarter, which limited our share repurchases to just $25 million at an average price of $2,320. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $400 million remaining under our share authorization program, and we will be able to resume opportunistically repurchasing our shares when the window opens -- reopens in a few days.\nWe opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, of which 43 had a Chipotlane. And we continue to anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen.\nTo close, I want to reiterate the message I shared at our recent All Manager Conference. fully started over 30 years ago with a young chef who thought is best food has served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. That evolved into our Food with Integrity journey, defined the traditional fast food model by investing more in our ingredients and shaping our economic model to help fund the investment. And today, we have a special brand and unique economic model that allows us to spend more on our ingredients, yet remain one of the most affordable meals in the industry while also maintaining industry-leading margins. These 3 characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate: premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. And this is a huge competitive advantage. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, the future looks very bright for Chipotle.\nAnd with that, we're happy to answer your questions."

Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results this year driven by our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. This is driving a much better experience for our teams and our guests and resulted in accelerating transaction growth throughout 2023.\nFor the year, sales grew 14% to reach $9.9 billion driven by a 7.9% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 26.2%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $44.86, representing 37% growth over last year. And we opened a record 271 new restaurants, including 238 Chipotlanes.\nWe also ended the year with a lot of momentum as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results. Our restaurant teams are making terrific progress in building a strong foundation around throughput, and the return of carne asada as a limited-time offer outperformed our expectations.\nFor the quarter, sales grew 15% to $2.5 billion driven by an 8.4% comp. Digital sales represented 36% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.4%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $10.36, representing 25% growth over last year. And we opened a record 121 new restaurants, including 110 Chipotlanes.\nAs a reminder, we are returning to our prepandemic practice of only providing annual account guidance. While January was impacted by weather throughout much of the country, as weather has normalized, our sales trends have strengthened. For the full year, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range as we continue to focus on the same 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future.\nNow let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number two, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\nStarting with our world-class people. I'm excited to share that Ilene Eskenazi joined my executive leadership team in November as our Chief Human Resources Officer with over 25 years of experience in leading human resources and legal functions across a wide range of industries. I'm confident Ilene will be instrumental in helping Chipotle to develop and retain talent at every level of the organization and enhance the support we provide to our people both in our restaurants and at our support centers, strengthening Chipotle as a best-in-class employer.\nAs I've said in the past, we want to attract and retain the best people that we can develop and grow. Part of this includes listening to their needs and investing in ways that will help our employees thrive both professionally and personally. This is why we recently added new benefits to our industry-leading benefits platform like enhanced mental health care, a student loan retirement match and additional financial wellness tools for our workforce.\nIn addition to our benefits, our long-term growth opportunity and promote-from-within culture provides a path for team members to advance quickly within Chipotle. In fact, in 2023, we promoted over 24,000 people and over 90% of restaurant management roles were internal promotions. This includes 87% of field leader positions, which is one of the biggest jumps for our teams, going from running 1 restaurant to an average of 8 restaurants.\nThe ability to achieve this rate of internal promotions is a result of our strong restaurant leaders, many of whom started as crew members and who are committed to training and developing our future leaders.\nA great example is one of our field leaders in New York, who has been with Chipotle for over 16 years. He helped to develop and promote over 40 team members who have grown within Chipotle and have gone on to become some of our best general managers, field leaders, team directors and even one of our regional vice presidents. This is the type of person who will help us to deliver on our goals of running great restaurants, delivering industry-leading economics and expanding to 7,000 restaurants in North America longer term. Great people executing great culinary and throughput results in a terrific guest experience and drives performance.\nThis brings me to our operations. Strong leadership is the key to running successful restaurants with fast throughput. So it is no surprise that the restaurants with the most tenured general managers are executing the best. The good news is our GM turnover is at some of the lowest levels that I have seen since I joined Chipotle. And over the last couple of quarters, we have put the building blocks in place to deliver great throughput.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we have adjusted the cadence of orders on the digital makeline to achieve a better balance of labor between the 2 lines. Additionally, we began collecting data on the execution of the 4 pillars of throughput in our restaurants and providing feedback and coaching on a weekly basis. This is allowing our restaurant teams to see progress, which is energizing and motivating as the experience of winning catches momentum. And finally, our teams now have real-time access to their MAX 15 throughput results in the moment, so our GMs can coach and recognize great throughput while it is happening.\nSince we put these coaching tools in place in the third quarter, we have seen the number of restaurants with at least 4 crew members on the frontline during peak periods improve from 30% to around 50%. This is driving an acceleration in our throughput performance as the number of entrees in our peak 15 minutes improved by a full point in the fourth quarter compared to last year.\nI'm thrilled to see the progress we are beginning to make, and continuing this momentum is critical as we approach our peak burrito season in mid-March. We will also further strengthen our industry-leading value proposition, which consists of delicious culinary made with real ingredients, most customizable, convenient, served quickly and at an accessible price point.\nWhen we are executing on all parts of our value proposition, we are providing a great customer experience, which helps all other drivers of sales to perform better, such as menu innovation. And last year, Chicken al Pastor and carne asada both surpassed our expectations and drove incremental transactions. This is a testament to the cross-functional effort by our marketing, culinary supply chain and restaurant teams that do an outstanding job innovating as well as bringing back past favorites that are more delicious each time and are executed seamlessly.\n2024 will be another exciting year for menu innovation, including 1 to 2 limited-time offers and rolling out creative ways to shine a spotlight on our core menu throughout the year. As part of highlighting the core, we recently launched our latest lineup of Lifestyle Bowls, which shows how the customization of our real ingredients allows Chipotle to embrace all interpretations of wellness, whether it be plant-based, high protein, keto, paleo and more.\nIn connection with the launch, we announced a partnership with Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 120 million athletes to encourage and reward healthy habits with a chance to earn free Lifestyle Bowls. This is giving our fans the right tools to sustain healthy habits in 2024 and beyond.\nIn addition to menu innovation, our marketing team continues to do a fantastic job of making the Chipotle brand more visible, more relevant and more loved to drive difference, culture and drive a purchase. Our Behind the Foil campaign is a great example that highlights key differentiators of Chipotle. This includes our restaurant teams preparing our real ingredients, made fresh every day using classic culinary techniques, such as dicing onions and jalapenos, hand mashing our signature guac and grilling our adobo chicken, steak and fajita veggies on the Plancha. We will continue to evolve Behind the Foil campaign in 2024. And it's really exciting to see that our best-performing ads are an authentic, behind-the-scenes look into a day in the life of a Chipotle team member. This certainly demonstrates one of our core values, which is authenticity here. Our food is real, and so are we.\nShifting to amplifying technology innovation. We have made a lot of progress this year on improving the digital experience. We made several enhancements to our app functionality, including order readiness messaging, wrong location detection, reminders to scan for points at checkout, prior order history and more. This has helped to reduce friction points and improve the overall experience for guests.\nWe also launched Freepotle for our Rewards members, which was successful in driving engagement and enrolling new members as we were able to surprise and delight our guests with free rewards, such as guac, a beverage or double meat. From the Freepotle drops, we were able to learn more about our Rewards members to improve our ability to deliver relevant experiences in the future.\nFinally, we recently rolled out suggestive upsell on our app at checkout based on data we have on our Rewards members, including prior order history. Going forward, I believe we are in a multiyear path to commercializing our customer data and insights into more targeted marketing campaigns and improving the overall digital experience that will drive increased frequency and spend over time.\nI also want to spend a few minutes providing an update on our Cultivate Next Fund, which launched 2 years ago with an objective of making early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world and accelerate our strategic priorities. Since launching this fund, the amount of innovation that we have seen across the food tech landscape has surpassed our expectations and encompasses everything from farming to supply chain to alternative proteins and oils to in-restaurant automation and more.\nWe have reviewed hundreds of innovative companies and have made 7 investments, of which there are many opportunities for commercial engagements. This includes Hyphen, which we are partnering with to develop our automated digital makeline; and Vibu, which we are partnering with to develop Autocado that cuts, cores and scoops avocados.\nBoth Hyphen and Autocado help to improve the overall experience for our teams by removing less favorable tasks and for our guests by providing on-time, accurate and delicious food. We continue to work on iterations of each technology at our Cultivate Center, and the good news is that we plan to pilot the automated digital makeline and Autocado in a restaurant in 2024 as part of our stage-gate process.\nLast month, we announced 2 more investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity. Greenfield Robotics provides regenerative agriculture solutions without chemicals using fleets of autonomous robots to weed fields. And Nitricity uses technology to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by creating natural fertilizer products that are better for fields, farmers and the environment. We believe both Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity could play an important role in ensuring a more sustainable future for farms within our supply chain.\nOur suppliers are a key enabler of Chipotle's growth and help us to further our purpose of cultivating a better world. We will continue to find innovative ways to support their ability to grow, harvest and supply the high-quality, sustainably raised, real ingredients that Chipotle serves.\nOur final strategic pillar is expanding access, and our development team has done an incredible job of meeting our development targets despite the time line challenges we continue to see. In the fourth quarter, we opened 121 new restaurants and for the full year, we opened 271 new restaurants, which is the highest number of openings in the company's history in a single quarter and in a single year.\nWe have now surpassed 800 Chipotlanes and continue to see very strong results with Chipotlanes driving higher new restaurant productivity, margins and returns. Additionally, this year, we had some fantastic openings in new markets with our first restaurant in Calgary breaking an opening day record and sustaining very high volumes post opening day. When we serve delicious food with exceptional operations and execute great local marketing, our brand gains traction quickly, and Canada is a testament to this. We will continue to accelerate our growth in Canada in 2024 with 10 to 14 new restaurant openings planned, representing 25% to 35% growth for the country. And in total, we continue to target 285 to 315 new restaurant openings in 2024, mostly in North America with over 80%, including a Chipotlane.\nSo to conclude, I want to thank our 115,000 employees for their hard work, which drove strong results in 2023. We hit some big milestones, including surpassing 3,400 restaurants, 800 Chipotlanes, $3 million in AUVs and forming our first international partnership.\nAs I look forward, I see the opportunity longer term to more than double our restaurants in North America, increase our penetration of Chipotlanes, surpass $4 million in AUVs, expand our industry-leading margins and returns, and further our purpose of cultivating a better world globally. As I mentioned in the beginning, this ambitious plan will require exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. The good news is that I'm certain we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve it.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nChief Financial Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 15% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 8.4% driven by over 7% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 25.4% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $10.36, representing 25% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to elevated depreciation and changes to a legal contingency.\nLooking to fiscal 2024. We anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range for the full year. As a reminder, we were impacted by unusually cold weather throughout the country in January. As the weather has normalized, our underlying sales trends remained strong, and they support our full year guidance range. Additionally, Q1 will include the benefit of an extra day due to leap year, but this will be offset by Easter shifting into Q1 this year compared to Q2 of last year.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year, a larger mix shift to be due to the success of carne asada as well as elevated cost across the board, most notably beef, produce and queso was partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and lower paper costs.\nFor Q1, we expect our [ 29% ] range as the benefit of the mix shift out of carne asada will be partially offset by higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados and tortillas. We anticipate cost of sales inflation to be in the low to mid-single-digit range for the full year.\nLabor costs for the fourth quarter were 25%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage and better labor execution more than offset wage inflation and higher performance-based compensation. For Q1, we expect our labor cost to be in the low 25% range with wage inflation in the low to mid-single-digit range. And we anticipate wage inflation will tick up to the mid-single-digit range as California wages go up around 20% in April of this year.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 14.7%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as lower marketing and promo costs, which were 3.1% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q1, we expect marketing cost to be in the low 3% range with full year to come in right around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 14% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $169 million on a GAAP basis or $170 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $1 million change in a legal contingency. G&A also includes $122 million in underlying G&A, $36 million related to noncash stock compensation, $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $2 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of this year.\nWe expect our underlying G&A to be around $127 million in Q1 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $32 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance and is subject to the final 2024 brands, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and $21 million for costs associated with our biannual All Manager conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $187 million.\nAdjusted depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.1% of sales. And for 2024, we expect it to remain right around this level as a percent of sales. Effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.2% for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And for 2024, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. And during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $144 million of our stock at an average price of $1,936. For the full year, we repurchased a total of $590 million at an average price of $1,827. And going forward, we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $424 million remaining.\nWe opened a record 121 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 110 had a Chipotlane. And as we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having a Chipotlane. We continue to see developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and high interest rates, along with permitting, inspection and utility installation delays. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes these challenges persist. And we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming conditions do not worsen.\nIn closing, Chipotle is a purpose-driven company that's been able to scale over the last 30 years into one of the largest restaurant brands in the world. An exciting part is that we still have a long growth runway in front of us. Our strong economic model gives us a high degree of confidence that our ambitious growth objectives are achievable, if not beatable. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, our long-term growth opportunity will only expand just as it has over the last 30 years. So thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication to Chipotle, and let's keep the momentum going in 2024.\nWith that, we'll open the lines for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCynthia Henn Olsen\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Strategy\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people continues to drive strong results, including positive transaction trends that accelerated throughout the quarter.\nFor the quarter, sales grew over 11% to reach $2.5 billion driven by a 5% comp. Digital sales represent 5% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales, restaurant-level margin was 26.3%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $11.36, representing 19% growth over last year and we opened 62 new restaurants, including 54 Chipotlanes.\nTrends remained strong in October, and we anticipate [indiscernible] in the mid to high which includes our recent pricing action. Before updating [indiscernible] joined our Board of Directors. Laura is Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of [ Hilton Worldwide ]with extensive experience in global hospitality and people leadership, and will be pivotal in helping Chipotle delivery against our 5 key strategies that position us to win today while we grow our future.\nThese include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers and expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings and laying the foundation for international expansion.\nBeginning with running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture. It was exactly a year ago that we made a big effort internally to get back to Chipotle's standard of excellence, and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams have made over the course of the year. This includes staffing and turnover that are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that are prepped and ready, resulting in fewer outages, improvements in on-time and accuracy on the digital make line and continued progress on throughput. Our focus on ops is strengthening a core piece of our value proposition, which is customized, delicious culinary served quickly with great hospitality.\nAs a result of improvements in operational execution, along with keeping our menu pricing accessible, our value proposition has never been stronger. This is certainly translating to great results with transaction comps positive all year and up over 4% in the third quarter. While we are sitting on a strong foundation, we see an opportunity to be even better, particularly when it comes to throughput. We have 2 key initiatives that we recently rolled out that we believe will drive further improvement.\nThe first is adjusting the cadence of digital orders to better balance the deployment of labor, eliminating the need to pull a crew member from the front make line to help the digital make line during peak periods. And the second is a renewed focus on throughput training in our restaurants by bringing back a coaching tool that we had in place prior to the pandemic. Feedback from our restaurant teams on these 2 initiatives has been very positive, and we are seeing that restaurants that have the right cadence of orders on the digital make line and that are executing the 4 pillars of throughput are seeing an improvement of 4 to 5 entrees in their peak 15-minute period.\nAs I mentioned in the past, we hold our teams to a high standard because when they achieve it, they feel like they are part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization. For our crew members, throughput is a key performance factor in the crew member bonus plan. It is also a component of the bonus measure for general managers, field leaders, team directors and regional vice presidents. As we coach and make progress on throughput, they will enable more restaurants to achieve their quarterly bonus and importantly, will drive a better overall experience for our guests and our teams.\nSeeing of our teams, we recently brought back our Behind the Foil campaign which features our crew members, giving a glimpse into daily preparation using real ingredients and classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. The fact is we don't have freezers in our restaurants and our teams begin preparing at 6 or 7:00 in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open at 10:30. This includes grilling Fajita Veggies, and adobo chicken on the planchas, slicing and dicing onions, jalapenos and cilantro by hand, also [ hand-mashing avocados ] to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day. This campaign is a great way to put a spotlight on our talented teams and their hard work to prepare our exceptional food.\nOne of our team directors that's featured in Behind the Foil started as a crew member and within 7 years, moved his way up team director, managing a subregion of 49 restaurants at just 29 years old. His passion for the brand and helping to deliver an excellent customer experience has driven his success. In fact, he is one of the best-performing subregions across the company. He truly believes in Chipotle's purpose, and wants to position his team to be able to replicate the same opportunities that have been given to him.\nOur people are our greatest asset and developing future leaders is critical in delivering on our growth goals of reaching 7,000 restaurants longer term and surpassing 90% internal promotions. We will continue to find ways like our Behind the Foil campaign to celebrate our team's growth, hard work, success and passion for Chipotle. In addition to this campaign, our marketing team has done an outstanding job in finding authentic ways to make the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved.\nLast month, we brought back our fan favorite and highly requested Carne Asada as a limited time offer and the reception has surpassed our expectations. Carne Asada is a delicious combination of responsibly raised premium cuts of steak, seasoned on the grill with a blend of signature spices that's finished with freshly squeezed lime and hand chop cilantro. We also introduced an entirely new way to try Carne Asada with the Carne Asada Quesadilla and it's just truly delicious. I'm really proud of the cross-functional effort it took to make sure we could bring back this popular LTO, which is especially impressive given that we estimate only about 5% of U.S. beef meats our Food with Integrity standards.\nIn sports, as College Football season kicked off, we leveraged our real food for real athletes platform to partner with players and teams to showcase their inspiring journeys, their love for Chipotle and how our food can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition. We also leverage creative gaming integrations as a fun way to connect with some of our biggest fans. We brought back Chipotle IQ in August as a one-of-a-kind digital trivia game, testing the knowledge of Chipotle's real ingredients, leading food standards, culinary techniques, sustainability efforts, brand history and community engagement.\nShifting to amplifying technology, we're making progress on a couple of innovations that ultimately could help to improve the overall experience for our restaurant teams and our guests. The first is our automated digital makeline, which we recently installed at our [ Cultivate Center ] to test and learn on. Through our partnership with Hyphen, we've been testing Hyphen makeline, which fits into our existing digital makeline footprint and automatically makes bowls down below with the ability for our team to build tacos, burritos, kids meals and quesadillas on top. There are many reasons why we are excited about automating the digital makeline, such as increased capacity and improved speed and accuracy which could further help with the balance of labor between the front makeline and the digital makeline.\nAdditionally, Autocado, which cuts cores and scoops avocado is also at our Cultivate Center and our restaurant teams are providing feedback to be included in the next phase of the prototype. As we mentioned last quarter, Autocado could save time and eliminate a less favorable task, but still allow for one of their favorite parts of the job, which is to add in freshly chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro, seasoned with some citrus and salt, and [indiscernible]. While we still have some iterations to make to Hyphen and Autocado before they're ready to be tested at a restaurant, I am excited about the progress the team is making, and we will continue to provide updates on the path through the stage-gate process.\nFinally, moving to expanding access and convenience. We are on track to reach our guidance range of opening between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year, which will mark a record for the company. And we surpassed 700 Chipotlanes this quarter. As we look out to 2024, we anticipate putting between 285 to 315 new restaurants with at least 80% having a Chipotlane.\nThis month, we opened our first location in [ Calgary ]. This was the first entrance into a new market in Canada since we entered Vancouver in 2012, and it is clear there is strong demand for Chipotle with opening day sales hitting a new company record. The team in Canada has done an outstanding job with company-leading throughput on the front line and on time and accuracy on the digital make line. AUV's margins and returns are on par with the U.S., and I remain very confident in Canada's long-term growth potential.\nOutside of North America, we have outlined a plan for Europe to deliver economics that would support accelerated growth. This includes improving our operations by aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our U.S. operations where it makes sense and is feasible as well as building brand awareness. Similar to our strategy when we first entered new markets in the U.S., we are building brand awareness in Europe through more local initiatives like partnering with local universities, local sports teams and focusing on activities, which gets our food into the hands of potential guests.\nThe good news is our restaurants are staffed stable and the talent we have coming through is exciting. Finally, in the Middle East, we are collaborating with Alshaya Group across development, culinary, supply chain and food safety to support a successful opening of our restaurants next year in Kuwait and Dubai.\nIn closing, I remain really excited about all the growth ahead of us, both in the U.S. and internationally. I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work and dedication to Chipotle. Our results demonstrate that we have a winning team that sets high standards and delivers. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of running great restaurants, with exceptional people, exceptional food and fast throughput. I'm more confident than ever that we have created the foundation to achieve our aggressive growth goals and further our purpose of cultivating a better world.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nChief Financial Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the third quarter grew over 11% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 5% with over 4% transaction growth. Restaurant level operating margin of 26.3% increased about 100 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $11.36, representing 19% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had $1 million in unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring.\nLooking ahead to Q4, based on the trends we've seen so far in the quarter, including mid-single-digit transaction comps, we anticipate comps in the mid- to high single-digit range which includes our recent price increase of about 3%. As reminder in the fourth quarter, we will reevaluate estimated loyalty breakage for points projected to expire which may require a catch-up adjustment that could have a negative or positive impact on our comps, and that's not factored into our guidance. We continue to forecast full year [indiscernible] in the mid- to high single-digit range.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases was mostly offset by inflation across several food costs, most notably beef and queso. For Q4, we expect our cost of sales to be right around 30% as the benefit of the menu price increase we just took will be offset by the mix shift from Chicken Al Pastor to Carne Asada as well as higher cheese and avocado prices.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was mostly offset by wage inflation. And for Q4, we expect labor cost to be in the mid-25% range as the benefit of the menu price increase will be offset by continued labor inflation. And within our guidance, we anticipate a similar level of paid time off and other benefits that we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 14%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2% and in Q4, we expect marketing costs to step up to the mid-3% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $159 million on a GAAP basis of $158 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $1 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. G&A also included $120 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to noncash stock compensation. $3 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity investing and exercises and $1 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of next year. For Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million and to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.\nWe anticipate stock comp will be around $33 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize about $3 million related to performance-based bonus [indiscernible] and payroll taxes and equity investing exercises and $2 million related to our All Manager Conference, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $160 million. We anticipate the preopening expenses to be around $15 million in Q4 to the cadence of new restaurant openings. And as a reminder, about half of preopening expense is noncash preopening rent related to straight-line accounting rules.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.2% of sales and for Q4, we anticipate depreciation expense to step up by $4 million to $5 million due to a larger number of expected new restaurant openings. Asset [indiscernible] was $7.2 million in the quarter and in Q4, we expect [ asset retirement ] to be around $8 million as we continue to focus on proactive equipment replacement as we prioritize the guest experience through great operations.\nOur effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.2%, which benefited from higher-than-expected tax credits. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range that may vary each quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt.\nDuring the third quarter, we repurchased $226 million of our stock at an average price of $1,914 more than 2.5x our Q2 purchases as we were optimistic as the market softened. At the end of the quarter, we had $368 million remaining under our share authorization program.\nWe opened 62 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 54 had a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to open between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year. And as Brian mentioned, we plan to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, of which at least 80% will have a Chipotlane. We anticipate that our time line will remain extended, which is preventing us from reaching the higher end of our 8% to 10% new restaurant opening guidance range in 2024. We continue to see permitting and inspection delays, utility installation delays along with developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and rise in interest rates. Considering our current pipeline and time line and assuming conditions do not worsen from here, we believe we can approach 10% new restaurant openings by 2025.\nTo conclude, I want to once again thank our 114,000 employees for treasuring our guests and earning every single customer visit. We have exceptional people working hard every day to serve exceptional food to our guests, and that shows through these terrific results. As Brian mentioned, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and as we continue to make meaningful progress in improving the guest experience through faster throughput in our restaurants. This will further strengthen our brand and industry-leading economic model and continue to position us for long-term growth.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The strength in our business continued into the second quarter, driven by our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people as well as the success of Chicken Al Pastor. For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.5 billion driven by a 7.4% comp. In restaurant sales increased 16%, digital sales represented 38% of sales, restaurant-level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $12.65 representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 47 new restaurants, including 40 Chipotlanes.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate comps in the low to mid-single-digit range driven by transaction growth as we are rolling off of pricing. For the full year, we continue to anticipate mid- to high single-digit comps. Before reviewing our strategic priorities, I want to share a few organizational updates. As a way of maintaining a healthy growth mindset, we proactively conducted an in-depth review of our business needs and organizational structure to ensure we can deliver on our aggressive growth goals for future growth. This resulted in investments in areas like development, digital marketing and international expansion. At the same time, we also identified areas where we could better optimize our organizational structure, such as putting our end-to-end digital experience, including product design, analytics and the customer journey under [ Curt Garner ], our Chief Customer and Technology Officer.\nAdditionally, we streamlined our strategic project management process to focus on key projects and to enable faster and more efficient decision-making. These changes will further support our 5 key strategies that will position us to win today while we grow our future which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers, and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings and laying the foundation for international expansion.\nStarting with our Restaurants. While Project Square One is wrapping up, we have made the decision to permanently embed the program within our training DNA. On a quarterly basis, our crew members will be retrained on key components ensuring we are always focused on being brilliant at the basics and that we never lose sight of training and developing exceptional people and preparing and serving exceptional food.\nNext quarter, we will reemphasize throughput and elevate our focus on proper deployment standards during peak periods, where we often only have 3 crew members on the front make line versus our minimum deployment of 4. The 4th person, which is often the expeditor may leave the front line to help the digital make line. Our focus will be on coaching the expected to stay on the front line and to bring together the items in an order and communicate them to the cashier as alleviating this bottleneck is critical for delivering great throughput. Additionally, we believe we have an opportunity to better optimize our smarter pickup times and deployment of labor on the digital make line during peak periods. As you may remember, we began testing changes to the cadence of orders on the digital make line in several markets to see if we could improve throughput by eliminating the need to pull a crew member from frontline to help the digital make line.\nThe good news is that in these restaurants, we are seeing an improvement in throughput on the front line and an improvement in on time on the digital make line. We will continue to test adjusting the cadence of orders on the digital make line at certain restaurants and roll out where we see the opportunity to improve the overall experience. We remain confident that balancing the deployment between the front and digital make lines along with continuous training and reps will further drive improvements in throughput.\nIn fact, we have seen evidence of this in certain restaurants. I was recently in New York at our Chipotle on 50th Park, and it was a great experience with delicious food and fast throughput on the Front Line compared to my experience at the same restaurant exactly a year ago. The improvement in throughput was certainly noticeable as deployment of labor between the front make line and the digital make line was more balanced. Over the last year, the field leader responsible for this patch of restaurants in New York City worked with the GMs and crew members shoulder to shoulder on throughput fundamentals. During his regular restaurant visits, he also followed up with consistent feedback by reminding of restaurants to have an explant position during peak periods.\nBy having the proper deployment with an EXPO in place and the right balance between the front make line and the digital make line, throughput in his patch of restaurants improved by nearly 5 entrees in the peak 15 minutes as compared to the prior year. His restaurants are also outcomping his region and the company average, demonstrating throughput drives performance. This is the type of leader we want to develop, one that builds a strong team, runs world-class restaurants, ensures we serve exceptional food every day and inspires our teams to achieve great results. And this brings me to our world-class people leadership.\nAs part of our focus on developing our teams, we relaunched Cultivate University for our newly promoted field leaders, which is a 3-day training program on the skills they need to truly excel in managing their patch of restaurants. This includes developing future leaders, the foundations of exceptional throughput and coloring, why it's critical to protect our economic model and a culture of accountability. One of the most challenging transitions is from General Manager, managing 1 restaurant to field leader in managing around 8 restaurants. Cultivate University is a program that will be offered each year to support our new field leaders as they make this transition to managing a $20 million business.\nWe remain committed to hiring and developing the best people to work at Chipotle through our competitive wages, industry-leading benefits and tremendous growth opportunity. In fact, we are on track to surpass our 22,000 promotions from last year and create over 7,000 new jobs with our restaurants anticipated to open in 2023. We are also relaunching our successful and long-running Behind the Foil ad campaign. This campaign provides unfiltered and emotional testimonials from our team members about the impact Chipotle has had on their lives as well as a glimpse into our daily preparation using our real ingredients and classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. What better way to make the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved than to feature our talented restaurant team members preparing exceptional food.\nAnd speaking of exceptional food, our menu innovation has been outstanding this year. Chicken Al Pastor has proven to be a popular LTO with 1 in 5 transactions, including the new protein. It is boosting transactions with a strong repeat and is attracting new customers to Chipotle and also delivered the highest positive social sentiment of any new menu introduction and importantly, was simple for our teams to execute, which resulted in a win all around. As Chicken Al Pastor wraps up in late August, we have a planned new menu item for later in the quarter. Our rewards program is another way we aim to drive frequency within our existing customer base as our reward members come more often and spend more than nonrewards members. We launched [ Free Putla ] earlier this year, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members with 10 free rewards dropped into our members' accounts throughout the year.\n[ Free Pulte ] has been successful in driving enrollments in the first half of the year as we surpassed 35 million reward members. With each strategic [ Free Pulte ] drop, we are learning more about our customers' behaviors and utilizing those learnings to personalize future offers. We will continue to look for creative ways to drive enrollment and improve engagement in our rewards program. In traditional media, we remain top of mind at sporting events as we leverage the basketball playoffs as a high-profile opportunity to spotlight the Chipotle brand and through our NHL partnership, our Chipotle logo was featured on the ice during the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nAdditionally, the return of the popular Chipotle hockey jersey [ Bogota ] had the highest participation in the history of the program. Chipotle's ingredients continue to power many of the top male and female athletes on and off the field. Through our real food for real athletes campaign, we have showcased the inspiring journeys of athletes across all levels of sports and how Chipotle can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition. Partnering with athletes and teams, along with traditional media around big sporting events has been an authentic and successful way to connect the brand to some of our biggest fans.\nShifting to technology and innovation in our restaurants. First, I wanted to provide an update on the benefits we have seen from the dual sided Grill, which we discussed last quarter. The new grill can cook the chicken in under 4 minutes versus 12 minutes on the plancha and can cook the stake in under 1 minute versus 4 minutes on the Plancha. This allows for a faster recovery of freshly grilled chicken and steak resulting in more opportunities to remain in stock during peak periods as well as the ability to cook smaller batches, ensuring superior culinary.\nAdditionally, the grill allows for more consistent execution with the same [ Ser ] and [ car ] and maintains better moisture resulting in juicier chicken and stake with less waste. Finally, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improved learning curve, making it a more desirable role for our teams. The feedback from our guests and our teams continue to be very positive and we recently completed the rollout of the dual sided grill into 10 high-volume locations as the next step in the stage gate process. We also began to do a broader rollout of our new third pan rice cookers, which eliminates our large race pots and cooks the rice in our third pans that you see on the line.\nThis streamlines the rice cooking process while delivering fresh, high-quality rice that scooped perfectly to our standards. It can also make single batches allowing for a faster recovery time, less waste during nonpeak periods and the ability to make white and brown rice at the same time. We have rolled this out to our new restaurants with plans to add it to another 200 existing restaurants this year.\nAnd as part of our Cultivate next fund, we recently invested in [ Vibo ], and together, we are exploring collaborative robotics that will drive efficiencies and ease pain points for our employees. One device that we are in the process of developing cuts, cores and peel an avocado. It's called the [ Autocat ]. This cobotic prototype saves time and eliminates a less favorable task, but still allows our teams to hand match our signature block. As you can see, all of these initiatives have a common goal, which is to improve the in-restaurant experience for our teams and our guests while maintaining or improving upon our high culinary standards.\nI'm really proud of the work the teams are doing to leverage automation, technology and artificial intelligence, and it was nice to be recognized as one of Time Magazine's most innovative companies last month. Our final key strategy is to expand access and convenience. I'm thrilled to share the addition of [ Stephen Piacentine ], as our new Chief Development Officer. Stephen has extensive experience at some of the largest restaurant brands and will lead our very talented and tenured development team as we look to reach 7,000 restaurants over time in North America.\nThis year, we continue to target 255 to 285 new restaurants with over 80%, including a Chipotlane. And in fact, this quarter, we opened our 600th Chipotlane. In Canada, performance remains strong with 34 locations, we are on track to add about 10 new restaurants this year. We had our highest opening day ever in Canada this past quarter, which is a testament to the increasing excitement around the brand and our growth opportunity in the country. We also believe there's even more opportunity beyond the 7,000 restaurants we are targeting longer term in North America and we are laying the foundation for further international growth. Through our recent reorganization, we added resources to our European operations, including bringing over one of our top U.S. operators to Europe to drive productivity and better align our operations with the U.S. We look forward to continued progress in Europe over the coming quarters as we aim to set up the region for long-term growth.\nAnd finally, we recently announced our first ever development agreement with the Alshaya Group, to open restaurants in the Middle East, which will further accelerate our international efforts. The Alshaya Group has successfully expanded many of the largest global brands into the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, and they plan to open our first restaurants in Kuwait and United Arab Emirates in 2024. We're excited to offer guests in Middle East are responsibly sourced, classically cooked real food and look forward to furthering our purpose to cultivate a better world in this new territory.\nIn closing, I want to thank our 114,000 employees for all their hard work to reestablish Chipotle standards of excellence and culture of accountability. Earlier this month, Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary of the opening of the first Chipotle restaurant in Denver, Colorado. What makes Chipotle special and has driven our success over the last 30 years is our people, our purpose of cultivating a better world and our focus on delivering exceptional food. Our culinary using the highest quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques makes our food delicious. Our customization, convenience and speed are differentiators and our value is simply tremendous. This has resulted in an industry-leading brand with industry-leading economics, and we still have a long runway for growth. We are well positioned to win today while we grow our future over the next 30 years.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nChief Financial Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 7.4% with over 4% transaction growth, for the third quarter, we anticipate comps in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by transaction growth as we roll off nearly 500 basis points of pricing in early August. We continue to forecast full year comps in the mid- to high single-digit range.\nRestaurant-level margin of 27.5% increased about 230 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $12.65, representing 36% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring and corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of [ Petro locally ]. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales.\nCost of sales in the quarter were 29.4%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices were partially offset by elevated costs across the board, most notably in beef, tortillas, dairy, salsa beans and rice. For Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be around 30% due to higher beef and avocado prices. Our supply chain team has done a fantastic job of diversifying our avocado exposure. And in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados will come from Peru. While prices are higher than the very favorable levels in the second quarter, we are less impacted from the volatility in the Mexican avocado market.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 24.3%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was partially offset by wage inflation. And for Q3, we expect our labor costs to be around 25%, reflecting continued labor inflation and seasonally lower sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.9%, a decrease about 40 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, and in Q3, we expect marketing costs to step down to the low 2% range before stepping up in Q4 with the full year to come in right around 3%.\nIn Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-14% range. G&A for the quarter was $157 million on a GAAP basis or [ $153 ] million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $3.5 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. As Brian mentioned, we recently went through a review of our organization needs to ensure we're well positioned to get near long-term growth goals. G&A also includes $119 million in underlying G&A. $29 million related to noncash stock compensation and $5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity investing and exercises.\nFor Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million and to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $31 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $160 million. [ Deiter ] for the quarter was $79 million or 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants.\nAsset Retirement stepped up to $16.2 million, which includes $8.5 million related to corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of [ PitoriLocali ]. In the near term, we expect asset retirement to be around $8 million per quarter as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.8% due to an increase in tax benefits related to option exercises and equity vesting. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased $88 million of our stock at an average price of $1,937. At the end of the quarter, we had $295 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 47 new restaurants in the second quarter which [indiscernible] had a Chipotle. And we remain on track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. Our development time line remains extended, but our pipeline remains strong and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these time line challenges subside.\nIn closing, when I joined Chipotle, we were approaching our 10th anniversary with just over 200 restaurants. We were determined to change the way people think about and eat fast food by preparing delicious fresh food using classic cooking techniques, sustainably raised wholesome ingredients and serving it quickly. Brian mentioned Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this month, and those fundamental values that made Chipotle successful are still deeply ingrained in our brand. Along the way, we've invested in food and integrity, expanded access and convenience through our digital channel. Chipotlanes and international expansion and continue to innovate within our restaurants to improve the overall experience. We still have a long growth runway ahead and a talented team excited to continue to build expand and evolve our brand and our purpose of cultivating a better world over the next 30 years.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to a great start with first quarter sales and margins ahead of our expectations. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.4 billion, driven by a 10.9% comp. In-store sales grew by 23% over last year. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.6%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $10.50, representing 84% growth over last year. And we opened 41 new restaurants, including 34 Chipotlanes.\nThese results demonstrate that our focus on running great restaurants with exceptional food and exceptional people is driving performance. Additionally, we benefited from exciting new menu innovations including Fajita Quesadilla and Chicken al Pastor. Transaction trends were positive throughout the quarter and the strength has continued into April.\nI would like to note that beginning this quarter, we are returning to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance and anticipate comparable sales to be in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year. We will also continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and anticipate second quarter comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range.\nNow, I would like to provide an update on our five key strategies that will position us to win today while we create the future, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants and support centers. Number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. And number five, sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level.\nFirst, starting with our restaurants. We recently held our Field Leader Conference, which included all Field Leaders, Team Directors’ and Regional Vice Presidents, as well as leaders from our restaurant support center. The message was clear. We are focused on developing exceptional people and preparing exceptional food. It was truly inspiring to see over 600 highly motivated leaders aligned to deliver Chipotle's standards of excellence and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams are making.\nWe had another outstanding quarter for turnover, with both hourly and salary metrics being some of the best I've seen in five years. The stability of crew and managers and a return to shoulder-to-shoulder training is helping to translate Project Square One into results. As our teams are getting more experience, we are continuing to see improvements in each of the Project Square One focus areas, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line, being prepped and ready with our delicious food, and the overall customer experience.\nSpecifically on throughput, while we are making progress, we see opportunities to do better. One area we are focused on is deployment on the front make line and the digital make line during peak periods. We have noticed that when the digital make line gets busy, our managers tend to pull a crew member from the frontline to help, which is impacting throughput. We are currently testing changes to the smarter pickup times logic based on different sales and deployment levels in several markets, and early results show that we are increasing throughput on the frontline and increasing on time on the digital make line without impacting sales.\nLeveraging our stage gate process, we will continue to fine-tune our testing before rolling it out in phases across our restaurants. We have also added an additional incentive for our teams as we recently rolled-out digital tipping across our restaurants as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our crew member benefits. This will enable our teams to be rewarded for their efforts in preparing delicious food and providing a great experience for our guests.\nOverall, our focus on being brilliant at the basics and re-establishing our standards of excellence is resonating well. Our teams love to be held to a high standard, because when you achieve it, you feel like you were part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization. We are starting to feel this again in our culture and in our people.\nWhen operations are running better, it helps all other drivers of sales to perform better, such as menu innovation, which brings me to our brand. As we often discuss, we continue to look for ways for the Chipotle brand to be more visible, more relevant and more loved, and we had a couple of very exciting new menu innovations that did just that. We responded to a real-time opportunity to support our passionate TikTok fans, who wanted Fajita veggies and Chipotle honey vinaigrette as options for our digital exclusive Veggie Quesadilla. We worked with two popular TikTok food reviewers, who made the idea go viral at the start of the year and leveraged our strength in digital marketing and culinary to creating exciting new menu items utilizing all existing ingredients. The results have been outstanding.\nDuring the launch, we nearly doubled our Quesadilla business and had two of our top digital sales days of all time. We have decided to make this a permanent menu item as the addition of Fajitas to our Quesadilla along with dipping it in a combination of our Honey Vinaigrette and Sour Cream is really delicious. The best part is, that it is made of all existing ingredients which limits additional complexity in our restaurants and we continue to see incremental Quesadilla sales because of this launch. We also launched Chicken Al Pastor as a limited time offer. Al Pastor store has been gaining mass appeal in recent years and we tapped into these consumer trends to offer our own spicy spin on Al Pastor with our freshly grilled chicken. \nAs we mentioned last quarter, this is also operationally simple to execute as it is our existing Adobo Chicken cooked on the plancha and then mixed in an Al Pastor marinate. This has allowed for an exciting new menu item, while still maintaining our focus on Project Square One. Additionally, this is the first time we have launched a new menu innovation globally, as it was rolled-out in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The launch has been a success, and early indications show that it is outperforming Pollo Asado, which was our most successful protein LTO ever.\nTurning to rewards. We now have 33 million rewards members and we saw a nice pickup in enrollments as we rolled out Freepotle, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members through our transaction-driving rewards program. Throughout the year, our members will receive 10 personalized free rewards ranging from a signup cloth, to a bag of chips, to a free fountain drink. In addition to driving enrollments, we also saw an increase in member engagement as Freepotle gained traction throughout the quarter.\nShifting to amplifying technology and innovation. We continue to leverage technology to improve our in-restaurant and digital experiences. As we mentioned last quarter, we began testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster, allows for more consistent execution, and maintains our high culinary standards as it cooks the chicken and steak to perfection with the same sear and char. The feedback from our teams and our guests has been tremendous and we are currently in the process of rolling out the grill to 10 additional restaurants as a part of further validation through our stage gate process.\nDuring the quarter, we also rolled out our advanced location-based technology for our app, which allows for a more seamless process for scanning rewards, as it prompts reward members to scan while they are waiting in line. This has resulted in more rewards members scanning for points in our restaurants, which drives further engagement in our rewards program. For digital orders, it also alerts app users when it appears they are ordering from or heading to the wrong location, as one of our most frequent refund request is due to guest arriving at the wrong restaurant.\nSince rolling out this feature, we have seen a meaningful reduction in those refunds. We are also investing in technology and innovation through our Cultivate Next Fund to help us scale and advance our Food with Integrity mission. We recently announced two new investments, including Local Line and Zero Acre Farms. Local Line is a leading local food sourcing platform connecting local producers with buyers and helping them digitize their operations and sell products. We believe Local Line will help Chipotle increase the amount of local food for our 3,200 restaurants. And Zero Acre Farms is a food company that is focused on healthy, sustainable cooking oils made by fermentation that are more environmentally-friendly.\nAdditionally, we recently announced our new Responsible Restaurant Design, which includes features like rooftop solar panels, all electrical equipment and systems, LED lighting, Cactus leather chairs, and electrical vehicle charging stations at select locations. While the pilot will go through the normal stage gate process, we believe it will enable us to take successful elements and incorporate them into future restaurant formats. These investments and initiatives will help to further our purpose of cultivating a better world and reflects our commitment to inspire real sustainable change with a potential impact far beyond our Company.\nAnd this brings me to expanding access convenience with a long-term target of 7,000 restaurants in North America. We remain on-track to grow new restaurants 8% to 10% per year for the foreseeable future, with at least 80% including a Chipotlane. The expansion of Chipotlanes adds additional convenience by adding our unique order pickup channel, which comes with a larger digital penetration driven by the order-ahead business.\nIn Canada, we opened our first Chipotlane in Ontario and we also expanded access and convenience with our recently-announced partnership with SkipTheDishes, which is Canada's largest food delivery network. Finally, new openings in small towns continue to be a success, with the recent opening of a restaurant in a small town in California that had the second-highest opening day sales ever. In fact, within the last year, we had our top five openings in the Company's history, of which four were in small towns.\nI'll turn now to sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Our recent Field Leader Conference was a time to celebrate the achievements and career progression of our teams and I'm always amazed by all the inspiring stories of our leaders. In fact, one of our Field Leaders from the Arizona sub region, who won the award for best throughput has been with Chipotle for 20-years. She is clearly doing a terrific job leading her patch of restaurants. However, what is even more incredible is that she has two sisters, one a Team Director, who has been with Chipotle for 24-years and is consistently a top performer in her region. And the other is a recently promoted Field Leader who has been with Chipotle for 18-years. Each has a unique story, but all three sisters started as crew members and said that Chipotle changed their lives for the better and gave them the ability to develop and grow others within the organization.\nWhen you combine our industry-leading benefits with our tremendous growth, performance culture, and then layer on top exceptional leaders, who will help to grow and develop our future leaders, Chipotle really is a special Company.\nIn closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work in delivering a great quarter. Our focus on getting back to the basics and reestablishing Chipotle's Standard of Excellence is beginning to drive strong results. We will continue to develop exceptional people and prepare exceptional food and of course treasure our guests. In doing this, I strongly believe we can make Chipotle better than ever. With that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJack Hartung\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.4 billion as comp sales grew 10.9%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.6% increased about 490 basis points, compared to last year. Relative to our guidance, restaurant-level margin benefited from leverage from higher sales, labor efficiencies and lower avocado prices.\nEarnings per share was $10.50, representing 84% year-over-year growth. The first quarter did not have any material unusual expenses or our GAAP earnings and non-GAAP earnings are the same.\nAs Brian mentioned, we are going back to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance. We anticipate comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year, assuming we do not see further deterioration in the macro environment. As a reminder, for Q2 and the full-year, our comp stepped down when we lapped the menu price increase we took in late March of last year, and we anticipate comps will step down again when we lap the menu price increase we took in early August of last year. We'll continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and we anticipate comps in the second quarter in the mid-to-high single-digit range as the transaction trends for the first quarter has continued into April.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.2%, a decrease of about 180 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices more than offset a mixed headwind from the Garlic Guajillo Steak limited time offer which ended in mid-February, as well as higher prices across several items including queso, beans, rice, salsa and tortilla.\nFor Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain in low 29% range. The mix benefit from the Chicken Al Pastor limited time offer and lower dairy costs will be offset by higher costs in other areas, most notably avocados. We anticipate avocados to increase from the current favorable levels, which are some of the seasonally lows we have seen in the past few years.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 24.6%, a decrease of about 170 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was partially offset by wage inflation. For Q2, we expect our labor cost to remain in the mid-24% range as continued labor inflation will be offset by leverage from seasonally higher sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 15.3%, a decrease of about 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs.\nMarketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.2% and in Q2 we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid-2% range, with the full-year to come in right around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $148 million, which includes $119 million in underlying G&A, $19 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $10 million, primarily related to payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises, higher performance-based accruals, and costs associated with our Field Leader Conference. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $122 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.\nWe anticipate stock comp will be around $22 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q2 to around $148 million.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $77 million or 3.2% of sales. And we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Asset retirement stepped up to $8.4 million in the quarter. This includes charges related to the replacement of equipment such as fryers, grills, rice cookers and other restaurant equipment as we have been more proactive under Project Square One in preventing ingredient outages.\nIn the near-term, we expect asset retirements to remain around this level as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.5%, which benefited from option exercise and share vesting and stock prices above the grant values. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $132 million of our stock at an average price of $1,553. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the overall market and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. At the end of the quarter, we had $282 million remaining under our share authorization program.\nWe opened 41 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 34 had a Chipotlane and we remain on-track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year, with least 80% including a Chipotlane. We continue to experience challenges including utility installation, component and raw material shortages, and permitting and inspection delays, which have extended our development timeline. And while we anticipate these challenges to persist throughout the year, our pipeline remains strong and we expect to move toward the high-end of the 8% to 10% of openings range once these timeline challenges subside.\nIn closing, 2023 is off to a great start as our focus on strong operations and treasuring our guests is driving an improvement in sales and margin trends. While we are proud of the progress our teams have made in a short period of time, we recognize that there is still opportunity for us to be even better. We believe that these efforts will position us to successfully navigate through macro uncertainty and more importantly, strengthen our foundation for sustained long-term growth. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Olsen\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call.\nBy now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChairman & CEO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe delivered another year of strong results in 2022, expanding AUVs and restaurant-level margin despite facing one of the highest inflationary periods on record and an uncertain macro environment. These results demonstrate Chipotle's resiliency driven by our talented teams, delicious food made fresh daily, convenience, customization, and of course, our tremendous value.\nFor the year, sales grew 14% to reach $8.6 billion driven by an 8% comp. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 23.9%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $32.78, representing 29% growth over last year, and we opened 236 new restaurants, including 202 Chipotlanes.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with our overall growth, our results were impacted by a few factors that were unique to the quarter, including a lower-than-expected benefit from Garlic Guajillo Steak and a headwind from loyalty accounting.\nFor the quarter, sales grew 11% to $2.2 billion driven by a 5.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 18% over last year. Digital sales continue to represent 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24%, an increase of 380 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $8.29, representing 49% growth over last year, and we opened 100 new restaurants, including 90 Chipotlanes.\nOur transaction trends improved throughout the quarter as we lapped brisket, and I'm pleased to report that our underlying trends have further improved entering 2023, with transaction trends turning positive. For the first quarter, we anticipate comps in the high single-digit range.\nOur focus on getting back to the basics and running great restaurants is beginning to pay off, and we plan to further emphasize this in 2023. Additionally, we will continue to build upon our 5 key strategies that will help us to win today while we create the future.\nNow let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number four, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.\nBeginning with our restaurants. As we discussed on the last call, Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and it is critical that we treasure the guest and deliver an exceptional experience, including great culinary and in-restaurant execution. During the pandemic, there were unforeseen challenges, such as supply outages, staffing challenges and exclusions from COVID that resulted in a need to create workarounds. We have been eliminating the workarounds and reestablishing operational standards with Project Square One while continuing to build a culture of excellence in every aspect of our business. This means ensuring all ingredients are in stock, that our teams are fully staffed and properly deployed during peak periods to drive throughput, that our delicious food is prepped and cooked on time, that we are improving throughput on the frontline and improving on time and accuracy on the digital make-line; and of course, that we are delivering exceptional customer hospitality. Project Square One has helped to lay the foundations, including training in each of these areas. We are also bringing back more shoulder-to-shoulder training.\nOne thing that I believe everyone has learned from the pandemic is that virtual training is not the only tool needed. So we are reducing the amount of virtual training and bringing new crew members into our restaurants sooner for on-the-job training. This helps to accelerate onboarding and gives more confidence to our new crew members as they are learning by doing. Shoulder-to-shoulder training by experienced managers is an essential process.\nI'm also happy to see an improvement in turnover with December being one of our best months in the past 2 years for both hourly and salary turnover rates. And our staffing levels continue to improve with 90% of our restaurants fully staffed. This, combined with better stability, leads to more experienced teams.\nWhen you combine this with Project Square One training for the past 2 quarters, positive signs are emerging across the operation. We are focused on operational excellence and have intensity and collaboration to achieve it. Great people and great culinary drives performance.\nAnd speaking of great people, I'm proud to share that in 2022, we promoted over 22,000 people, surpassing 2021, and 90% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. And we have tremendous growth ahead. In 2023, to open our new restaurants, we will have the opportunity to promote over 1,800 hourly manager roles, over 255 GMs and over 40 field leadership positions. And these numbers will continue to grow as we expand our restaurants by our targeted range of 8% to 10% per year.\nAs we have said in the past, our goal is to be the employer of choice. In addition to career advancement opportunities, industry-leading benefits and competitive wages, we will continue to look for ways to improve the overall experience for our teams.\nWe know one way is to continue to invest in technology and innovation. There are a couple of new stage-gate initiatives that I'm excited to share along with an update on improvements to our app functionality. First, we are currently testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster and has consistent execution, which lowers the learning curve significantly. Importantly, we believe it maintains our high culinary standards and can cook the chicken and steak to perfection. We look forward to further validating it through our stage-gate process.\nAnd second, you may remember that in the second quarter, we announced Hyphen as one of our first investments in our Cultivate Next fund. Hyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on the digital make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on-time, accurate orders for our digital guests. This would allow our restaurant teams to focus more on our in-restaurant guests on the frontline, further improving throughput. I'm thrilled to share that together with Hyphen, we are developing our first automated digital make-line prototype, which we will test and learn on, and we expect to have it in our Cultivate center in the first half of this year.\nSpeaking of our digital business, it is over $3 billion in revenue and represents 39% of our sales, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our guests. Last quarter, we started testing advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality. For guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code at checkout and more.\nThe results from the stage-gate process were very encouraging, including an improvement in delivery speed, a reduction in customers going to the wrong location and an improvement in the experience for our Rewards guests, allowing them to quickly scan for their Rewards points without impacting throughput. As a result, we rolled it out nationwide last month.\nMoving on to making our brand more visible, more relevant and more loved. Our Real Food for Real Athletes platform has been a success as we partner with athletes of all levels who are fans of Chipotle and focus on helping them perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we teamed up with U.S. Men's National Soccer Team stars, Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie to showcase their journey to soccer's biggest international tournament while featuring the athletes' go-to orders in our app. We also continue to leverage social media to remain relevant with our consumers, especially Gen Z. This year, we surpassed 2 million TikTok followers, which to put into context rival some of the largest brands in the world. And we were the first brand to launch on the new social media platform, BeReal.\nShifting to menu innovation. As we mentioned last quarter, 2023 will consist of 1 to 2 LTOs. I'm delighted to share that Chicken Al Pastore has been validated and ready to be rolled out in the near future. This new menu item is operationally simple to execute while still providing a new exciting flavor that drive transactions and sales.\nWe also recently launched a new lineup of Lifestyle Bowls that cater to contemporary wellness habits of Gen Z and millennials. The lineup spans a wide range of healthy habits such as our Balanced Macros Bowl, our High Protein Bowl and our Grain Freedom Bowl. Lifestyle Bowls are a great way to show our customers that they can create balanced meals made with our existing ingredients that taste great and that they feel great eating.\nTurning to our Rewards program. In 2022, we increased our Rewards members by 20% to 31.6 million. Our program continues to get more sophisticated as we better understand who our members are and serve them with relevant content, targeted offers and gamified badging to help drive transactions. In 2022, 60% of our Rewards program promotions were personalized, and we plan to increase this going forward. To drive engagement and enroll new members, we recently introduced Freepotle, which offers each Rewards member 10 personalized free rewards throughout the year.\nOur fifth strategic pillar is to expand access, and our development team has done an outstanding job of navigating headwinds such as material shortages and permitting and inspection delays while successfully opening 236 new restaurants in 2022, including 202 Chipotlanes. In fact, we opened 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, which was a record for the company. We also opened our 500th Chipotlane during the quarter as we expanded access and convenience through our unique digital drive-through format, and the performance of Chipotlanes continues to be strong. In fact, since we began opening Chipotles in 2018, our new restaurant productivity has improved by about 1,000 basis points. We plan to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with over 80% including Chipotlanes.\nWithin our 2023 expansion plans, we will accelerate new restaurant growth in Canada and continue to open restaurants at a measured pace in Europe. In Canada, we have built out a strong local field leadership team that works closely with our U.S. team to ensure best practices and a consistent culture while adapting to local needs. We are now ready for accelerated growth and plan to add around 10 new restaurants in 2023, which will be the fastest development growth rate since we entered the Canadian market.\nWe also remain encouraged by the performance in Europe despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. In 2023, we plan to add a few additional locations in the U.K., and we are also rolling out our digital capabilities to further expand access. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunity, and we'll continue to update on Europe's progress of the stage-gate process along the way.\nIn closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for another terrific year. Our focus on getting back to the basics is starting to pay off. Our teams are energized, and I'm excited to see further progress over the coming quarters. We have a long growth runway ahead with the ability to more than double our restaurant count, grow AUVs beyond $3 million and expand margins. I believe we have the right team and strategy in place, and we will remain focused on meeting the standards of excellence that make Chipotle, Chipotle.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nCFO & Chief Administrative Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.\nSales in the fourth quarter grew 11% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 5.6%, which included about an 80 basis point headwind related to our loyalty program. In Q4 of each year, we reevaluate the estimated loyalty breakage for points that will expire. And this year, we decreased our estimate due to higher member engagement.\nRestaurant-level margin of 24% increased about 380 basis points compared to last year. In addition to loyalty program headwind, restaurant-level margin was impacted by a higher level of sick pay and medical claims in the quarter compared to our expectations. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $8.29, representing 49% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification and corporate restructuring.\nTurning to our sales outlook for 2023. As Brian mentioned, we've seen the transaction trends turn positive as we remain focused on delivering a great guest experience. January comps were in the low double digits. And for Q1, factoring in momentum we've seen quarter-to-date as well as tougher comparisons as we move through the remainder of the quarter, we anticipate comp sales to be in the high single-digit range.\nWhile it's difficult to forecast comps for the rest of the year, considering economic uncertainty, including the possibility of recession, we expect comps to moderate as we lap menu price increases in early Q2 and the middle of Q3.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.3%, a decrease of about 230 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases and lower avocado prices offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy, tortillas, beans, rice and salsa. In Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high-29% range due to higher prices across several items, including queso, salsa, spices and oil.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 25.6%, a decrease of about 80 basis points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage was somewhat offset by wage inflation in addition to higher-than-expected sick pay and medical claims. For Q1, we expect our labor cost to improve slightly but remain in the mid-25% range due to seasonally higher employee taxes as employee taxes start the year at an elevated level due to resetting of wage caps.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 15.7%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales as well as sales leverage, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs.\nMarketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.4%, 20 basis points below last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $135 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million in legal expenses, $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also included $119 million in underlying G&A, $18 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a reduction in the estimated payout levels of our performance-based stock awards and was offset by $8 million reduction in performance-based bonus accruals.\nWe expect our underlying G&A to be around $121 million in Q1 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and is subject to the 2023 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and $2 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in February, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $155 million.\nDepreciation for the quarter was $74 million or 3.4% of sales, and for the full year 2023, we expect it to inch up slightly each quarter as we open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. And for 2023, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $199 million of our stock at an average price of $1,487. And we repurchased a total of $827 million in 2022, which was the largest amount ever repurchased in a single year. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.\nDuring the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $414 million remaining. We opened a record 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 90 had a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with at least 80% including a Chipotlane.\nDevelopment delays remain a headwind, including utility installations, permitting and inspection delays, construction, labor challenges and component and raw material shortages. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside.\nTo conclude, we're off to a strong start in 2023 with early signs of progress from our focus on getting back to the basics of running great restaurants and treasuring our guests. While we cannot predict how the macroeconomic environment will play out over the next 12 months, we will continue to strengthen our operations and work hard to earn each and every customer visit.\nI want to thank our restaurant teams and our restaurant support teams for all their hard work this year and for their commitment to Chipotle.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures.

Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChairman & CEO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrated the resiliency of the brand and strength of our organization in managing through a difficult consumer environment along with the inflationary headwinds we have experienced over the past 18 months.\nFor the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.2 billion, driven by a 7.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 22% over last year. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.3%, an increase of 180 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.51, representing 35% growth over last year, and we opened 43 new restaurants, including 30 Chipotlanes.\nIn the third quarter, we continue to see a widening of trends by income level with the lower income consumer further reducing frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, the majority of customers are from higher-income households, which continue to increase purchase frequency. While it is difficult to predict the macro impact on future spending trends, we know our value proposition remains strong and we experienced minimal resistance to our price increase in the quarter.\nTo put it into perspective, our average Chicken Burrito Bowl, which makes up about 50% of our orders across the U.S. is below $9 in our restaurants. This is a tremendous value when you consider the quality of our food, including our food with integrity standards, the fresh preparation utilizing classic cooking techniques, the customization, generous portions and of course, the convenience and speed.\nOur fresh preparation is particularly unique when comparing Chipotle to other restaurants. There are not many restaurant options that prepare their food fresh daily, and we do it in all 3,000-plus restaurants. Our restaurant teams begin preparation at 7:30 in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open.\nWe only use 53 real ingredients, all of which you can pronounce, and our dedicated employees prepare the food in our open kitchens using classic cooking techniques. This includes grilling Fajita Veggies and Adobo Chicken on the Plancha and mashing avocados to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day.\nSo again, when you combine all these elements, you get an industry-leading brand with a tremendous value offering. And our 5 key strategies will continue to help us win today while we create the future.\nNow let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, expanding access convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level.\nFirst, starting with our restaurants. We remain focused on being brilliant at the basics, including staffing our restaurants with talented team members focused on the foundations of the business. These include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment, improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-restaurant business.\nAt the end of last quarter, we rolled out an updated training program called Project Square One, which includes training around throughput, digital execution, food quality and hospitality to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've made some progress during the quarter, but we are not where we need to be. The capabilities of our teams need to and will improve. Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and we need to train and develop our teams so that these standards are met.\nAdditionally, in these uncertain times, it is critical that we treasure the guest, and this will be a primary focus of everyone in operations and across our company. With so much change over the past couple of years brought on by the pandemic, it has been refreshing to focus on the foundation which Chipotle was built.\nWe do see that our highest volume restaurants are meaningfully outperforming lower-volume restaurants in terms of throughput. What these restaurants have in common is experienced managers include that understand the importance of the foundations. As our newer restaurant employees go through the training and get more real-time reps, we believe we will see consistent improvement over time. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to look for ways to enhance our tools and systems to support in-restaurant execution and improve the overall experience for our employees and guests. I am excited to share a pilot that we recently announced as well as an update on Chippy. We are piloting advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality and provide a seamless, convenient experience for our guests.\nFor guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with our order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code to checkout and much more.\nAnd I'm happy to share that Chippy is now in one of our restaurants, and we are excited to test and learn from the autonomous robot that helps our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. Chippy is trained to replicate Chipotle's exact recipe to cook the chips to perfection, finishing with a hint of lime juice and a dusting of salt. Additionally, Chippy can make chips throughout the day, which results in fewer outages and improves freshness.\nMoving to our branding, our Real Food for Real Athletes platform continues to expand as we rolled it out to football, America's most watched sport. The campaign focusing on athletes that love to eat at Chipotle as part of their training and lifestyle as it helps them to perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real ingredients. At the pearl level, we brought together The 88 Club for the first time in an ad with Dallas football greats who were the #88: CeeDee Lamb, Michael Irvin, Dez Bryant and Drew Pearson. The 88 Club TV ad premiered during Sunday night football and all of the athletes' go-to Chipotle orders were featured in our app. Chipotle's 88 Club content achieved great engagement with millions of views across channels.\nAdditionally, at the college level, we took a local approach with the Real Food for Real Athletes campaign in Ohio, which is one of our biggest markets and where we have our largest restaurant support center. We partnered with Ohio State offensive lineman and running back TreVeyon Henderson, on an ad narrated by former Buckeye running by great (inaudible) Archie Griffin.\nTapping into the passion, the fans have for their favorite teams and game day excitement, the ad showcase TreVeyon's journey before he runs onto the field and was amongst our highest engaged videos in social media channels.\nShifting to LTOs. We remain comfortable with our cadence of 1 to 2 LTOs a year as it excites our guests and is driving both higher frequency and spend. As you may have seen, we launched Garlic Guajillo Steak in mid-September, which is an entirely new flavor profile featuring tender cuts or freshly-grilled steak with the bold flavor of Garlic And Guajillo peppers and finished with fresh lime and cilantro. In maintaining our relevance in the Metaverse, we premiered the Garlic Guajillo Steak to our community on Roblox where users could grill, season, cut and virtually taste the steak. The first 100,000 users who successfully completed the Chipotle Grill Simulator, received a promotional code that can be redeemed in our restaurants. Again, showing our ability to blend the Metaverse with real life.\nComplementing the Roblox experience, we also provided early access to our 30 million Rewards members as we continue to provide Rewards members with added value. While still early days, Garlic Guajillo Steak is getting excellent customer feedback and is driving a higher check as a premium protein experience. However, it is faced with the challenge of rolling over our highly successful Brisket program last year. As a reminder, Brisket ended in mid-November and the Garlic Guajillo Steak program will go through the end of the year.\nAdditionally, following the success of Pollo Asado, we began testing Chicken Al Pastor in Denver and Indianapolis. Chicken Al Pastor adds an exciting level of spice to guests go-to orders. And if successful in the stage-gate process, it could be available for rollout in 2023.\nOur next strategic pillar is expanding access, which is still a top request from consumers. We remain on track to open 235 to 250 new restaurants in 2022 and anticipate opening between 255 to 285 restaurants in 2023 barring any further delays in construction or equipment availability.\nOur pipeline remains strong. And as these challenges ease, we are confident that we can get to the top end of our targeted 8% to 10% range.\nIn addition to expanding in our core markets, we remain excited about new opportunities, including Alberta, Canada and small towns in the U.S. We plan to enter Alberta, Canada in 2023 with our first location in Calgary. Alberta makes the most sense as our next market to open in Canada as it has 2 of the main cities, including Edmonton and Calgary, each with relatively large populations. Additionally, there is brand recognition as people from Alberta have visited Chipotle restaurants in British Columbia and Ontario.\nIn the U.S., our small town strategy is also performing very well. Overall, small town restaurants have comparable margins and returns to the company average, and we're excited about the growth opportunity, which is included in our 7,000 long-term restaurant target. I'm also proud to share that opening day sales for a restaurant in a small town in Texas was a new company record. I would like to express my congratulations and gratitude to the restaurant and development teams for making that one happen.\nAnd speaking of teams, our purpose of cultivating a better world starts with our people. The importance of developing our people is paramount to running great restaurants as well as developing future talent to grow. I'm delighted that over 90% of our promotions are internal, and I believe we will continue to see that percentage go up. There are many examples of senior leadership roles that started out as crew members.\nIn fact, one story that particularly moved me was about our team in the Mid-Atlantic region, where our Regional Vice President, Team Director and Field Leader were all promoted from within the organization in March. Our RVP immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt and his first job was as a crew member in 2009. He is another person that has worked his way up from a crew member to Regional Vice President overseeing $1 billion in sales. For perspective, that would be the fourth largest company in Egypt.\nHis successor as Team Director immigrated to the U.S. from Palestine in 2017 with his first job as a crew member and now oversees a $200 million business. And finally, his successor is a field leaders of women who integrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia in 2015, who also started as a crew member and now oversees 7 locations totaling $20 million in sales.\nTheir perseverance is inspiring to many and a great example of how our growth and brand changes lives and communities for the better. Each of these individuals is also developing terrific talent that has the ability to become future leaders. For perspective, each year just in the United States and Canada, we have the opportunity to promote more than 1,500 managers to open our new restaurants.\nIn addition to career opportunities in industry-leading benefits, we also believe that communication between leadership and our restaurant teams is critical. We do this through several ways, including chitchats, where members of our executive leadership team meet with our restaurant teams to listen to their feedback. Through this feedback loop, we were able to identify that our teams wanted more educational benefits, which is why we implemented debt-free degrees and career certificates. And team members who have participated in our educational programs are 2x more likely to be retained and 6x more likely to be promoted. Supporting, developing and growing our people will remain a core focus for Chipotle and is key to growing to 7,000 restaurants.\nIn closing, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter. We remain committed to getting back to the basics and running great restaurants. I believe these actions will position us for strong performance in any environment and more importantly, is key to delivering an excellent customer and employee experience. I'm excited to see everyone back in our restaurants next week for our 22nd year at Boorito.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jack.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nCFO & Chief Administrative Officer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by reiterating Brian's commentary about treasuring our guests and earning every single transaction.\nDuring past periods of economic challenges, focusing on our guests, getting the details in the restaurants right and providing a great dining experience has served as well. As Brian mentioned, this will be the primary focus of our organization and what we believe will lead to building an even stronger brand for the future.\nNow moving to our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 7.6%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.3% increased about 180 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.51 representing over 35% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to onetime employee separation expenses, corporate and restaurant asset impairments, corporate restructuring and our previously disclosed 2018 performance share of modification.\nLooking ahead to Q4, our current comparable sales trends are choppy as we lap our Brisket LTO from last year and we expect our October comps will likely end in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full fourth quarter as Garlic Guajillo Steak will be in restaurants through the end of the quarter compared to Brisket, which ended in mid-November of last year.\nEarlier this month, we took a price increase in around 700 restaurants to address pockets of outsized wage inflation. Menu prices in each restaurant increased between 2% and 3%, which had a company-wide impact of about 0.5% overall. And I'll go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales.\nCost of sales in the quarter were 29.8%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy packaging and tortillas. In Q4, we expect our cost of sales to remain at about the same level as the benefit from the menu price increases will be offset by higher beef, chicken, dairy and tortilla.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 25.1%, a decrease of about 70 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and somewhat offset by wage inflation as well as lapping employee retention credit that we received in Q3 of last year. In Q4, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid-24% range due to leverage from our menu price increases as well as our premium price Garlic Guajillo Steak.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 14.5%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expense categories, most notably, utilities, including natural gas.\nMarketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.2% or 20 basis points below last year. And in Q4, we expect marketing costs will be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in right around 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be around 15%.\nG&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $136 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding about $4 million in employee separation and corporate restructuring costs and $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares. G&A also includes $115 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock compensation, a $1 million benefit related to the reversal in lower performance-based bonus accruals, mostly offset by payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $120 million in Q4 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support our ongoing growth.\nWe anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and $1 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in early 2023 bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $146 million.\nDepreciation was $71 million, and in Q4, we expect it to increase slightly to $73 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.4% for GAAP and 23.4% for non-GAAP, and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased $107 million of our stock at an average price of $1,438 and we've repurchased a total of $628 million year-to-date so far. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program, and at the end of the quarter, we had $413 million remaining.\nWe opened 43 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 38 had a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. As Brian mentioned, we anticipate opening between 255 and 285 restaurants in 2023 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. Development delays remain a headwind, including equipment and construction material shortages, construction labor challenges as well as permitting, utilities and inspection delays. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move towards the high end of our targeted 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside.\nTo conclude, we believe we have a tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us with room to more than double our current presence in the U.S. and Canada over the long term. We will remain focused on what makes our brands special. And that is our purpose of cultivating a better world, our food integrity standards, a strong unit economic model and of course, our talented and dedicated teams.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Olsen\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.\nI will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our outlook and our actual results could differ materially from the projections in the forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWe will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian R. Niccol\n\nChairman & CEO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter performance during a period of inflation and consumer uncertainty. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.2 billion driven by a 10.1% comp. In-store sales grew by 36% over last year. Digital sales represented 39% of total sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.2%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.30, representing 25% growth over last year. And we opened 42 new restaurants, including 32 Chipotlanes.\nI would like to spend a couple of minutes providing insight into current trends and our outlook. Regarding Q2, through mid-May, comparable sales were on track to reach the top end of our guidance range. Since then, the underlying trend has decelerated, and we anticipate mid- to high single-digit comps for Q3 with planned pricing in August.\nThere are a couple of key things we have learned during the quarter. Our pricing power is strong and the brand is resilient. Our culinary and Food with Integrity commitment is a key point of difference. Our restaurants are staffed with terrific people despite a difficult hiring and retention environment. And our people are still getting up to speed on running a growing multimillion-dollar digital business as well as a growing multimillion-dollar in-restaurant business.\nTo accelerate this learning curve, we are instituting an ops initiative focused on being brilliant at the basics. We did this in 2019 and saw a positive impact on the business right up to the pandemic in 2020. I will discuss this in more detail later.\nAnd finally, we are focused on the right strategies. It is as important as ever that we remain focused on our 5 strategies that help us to win today while we create the future. Now let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement.\nLet's start with discussing running successful restaurants. I'm happy to say that I've seen lines out the door and mobile pickup shelves full in Boston, Philadelphia, Denver, Austin, Ann Arbor, Dallas, Cincinnati, London, Paris and Los Angeles. I think everybody gets the point. Fortunately, we were staffed with terrific employees, and they are working hard with smiles on their faces and great attitudes. I'm very proud to say that our restaurant teams have successfully grown average unit volumes to about $2.8 million with 39% being digital.\nOur general managers and teams have adapted well to our growing digital and growing in-restaurant business. However, customers were waiting on digital orders and the front line was moving, but it could have been quicker. I know we can be better. This is why we have launched an ops initiative focused on retraining our crew members on the fundamentals of our business. These fundamentals include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment, ensuring that restaurants are staffed and appropriately deployed across both the digital make-line and front make-line; improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business; and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-store business.\nAdditionally, we completed the rollout of our new labor management tool that helps put the right people in the right place at the right time. We believe the combination of being brilliant at the basics with the new labor management tool will drive meaningful productivity in our restaurants. Along with our labor management tool, our technology road map remains robust. I think it is worth highlighting how we are investing in technology to support strong execution of the basics.\nWe just installed new customer-facing pin pads that offer faster and contact-free payment options. We've deployed a new learning management system that enables immersive ways for our employees to experience training and provides digitally enhanced e-learning courses, videos and resource materials.\nWe also are in the process of updating our POS hardware across the system, which should be completed by this year, and we have made DML enhancements that aid accuracy and throughput. These recently completed or in-flight programs will all be positive for our restaurant teams and guest experience.\nAdditionally, we will continue to invest in possible technology for the future, like Chippy, the autonomous robot we are testing that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to help our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. And we are exploring an automated real-time kitchen production system that ensures high-quality food is always available to meet the needs of our guests.\nThis brings me to our Cultivate Next venture fund, which is off to a great start and is giving us a front-row view of emerging food technologies. We are interested in our breadth of innovations, including sustainable farming, supply chain advancements, restaurant operating efficiencies and ways to elevate the employee and guest experience. We've received a lot of interest with over 200 inquiries for investments. And as you may have heard last week, we announced our first investments in Hyphen and Meati.\nHyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on a make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on time, accurate orders for our digital guests. We look forward to sharing more investments in the future that will help us drive meaningful change at scale.\nI do want to take a moment to discuss our people. Despite a challenging labor market, I am proud to say our staffing levels remain above 2019 levels. Our purpose of cultivating a better world with Food with Integrity has created a brand that people are proud to represent and be part of. We continue to offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts, along with our growth and purpose, are helping to attract and retain great employees.\nAnd our people development program is important in order to accelerate our new restaurant openings. The real estate pipeline remains strong and supports our target of 8% to 10% new restaurants per year with more than 80%, including the Chipotlane. We now have 430 Chipotlanes, and results continue to exceed our expectations with Chipotlanes generating higher average unit volumes and higher restaurant-level margins. In fact, a recent opening of a Chipotlane in a small town in California had one of the highest opening day sales in the company's history.\nIn addition to the U.S., we are also excited about our progress in both Canada and Europe. Canada has hit a stride with AUVs and returns that are at the same level as the U.S., and Canadian comparable sales trends remain strong. We currently have 29 locations in Canada and longer term, we see room for several hundred, which is included in our target of 7,000 restaurants in North America.\nAnd Europe continued to move through the stage-gate process. We have made significant progress in improving the economics in Europe driven by operational efficiencies, adding our digital systems and opening smaller formats that resemble the U.S. restaurants. We have opened 5 new restaurants in the U.K. over the last 18 months, and results have been strong. We are gaining confidence that Europe could be another layer to our growth story in the future.\nThis brings me to making the brand visible, relevant and loved everywhere we operate. Our Real Food for Real Athletes campaign focuses on helping athletes across all levels perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients. As an official sponsor of the NHL, we activated this relationship through traditional media and creative promotions to highlight Chipotle, including having our logo in the ice for every game of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Additionally, we have partnered with U.S. soccer to create behind-the-scenes content that showcases how Rose Lavelle and Sophia Smith overcame the challenges of competing at the highest level of women's soccer. And later this year, we will file the U.S. Men's National team via our sponsorship and with advertising during the World Cup.\nWe also continue to appear in nontraditional channels to drive difference, culture, and ultimately, a purchase. We recently launched Burrito Builder on Roblox on National Burrito Day. The first 100,000 players to successfully roll a virtual burrito at a virtual Chipotle earned a free entree on our app. This led to one of our best digital sales days and marks the first time a brand-enabled Roblox player to earn and exchange virtual Roblox currency for real-world items.\nOkay. Moving on to the menu. Our pipeline remains robust. Building upon the brand's recent success with menu innovations, including smoked brisket and pollo asado, we have tested and successfully validated garlic guajillo steak, and this steak is ready for rollout in the future.\nShifting to our digital experience. We now have a digital business tracking towards $3.5 billion in sales, and we currently have over 29 million Rewards members. We are mining the data every day for insights while leveraging the information to influence behavior and drive greater frequency. We are also working aggressively on greater personalization across the customer journey and obtain valuable insights on which incentives provide the greatest ROI.\nAdditionally, we're excited about the recent launch of the Rewards program in Canada, which will provide another way for Canadian guests to engage with the brand and provide Chipotle with the ability to further delight its Canadian Rewards members. Finally, our digital ecosystem is rolling out in the U.K., and France will follow shortly thereafter.\nTo conclude, there is much uncertainty we are all dealing with, but what I am certain about is Chipotle and its people will remain committed to leading and growing. I'm certain that over time, we have the ability to grow our average unit volumes and achieve at least 7,000 restaurants across the U.S. and Canada. I'm certain that we will move our purpose of cultivating a better world forward in a meaningful way I'm certain that Chipotle provides one of the best value propositions in the industry. I'm certain that we have the right teams with the right focus to navigate whatever comes our way and that our culture will continue to offer our crews terrific career opportunities. Finally, I'm certain that we are well positioned for long-term growth.\nLastly and very importantly, I want to thank our restaurant teams for their hard work and contributions to making Chipotle one of the best restaurant brands in the world. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nCFO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. Sales in the second quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 10.1%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.2% increased about 70 basis points compared to last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.30, representing nearly 25% year-over-year growth. Second quarter had unusual expenses related to certain legal proceedings, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as the restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, mostly offset by an unrealized gain on investments, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.05, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $9.25.\nRegarding our sales trends. As Brian mentioned, we were on track for comparable sales to reach the upper end of our guidance range for the first half of the quarter. Since then, we've experienced a step-down due to a combination of macro pressures, our ability to handle the growth with relatively new workforce and a return-to-normal summer seasonality for college-based restaurants. For perspective, about 15% of our restaurants are in college town, and we've not seen normal seasonality in 3 years.\nLooking ahead to Q3. With pricing from last year rolling off, our current trends in July are running in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comp to be in the mid- to high single-digit range, which includes our planned August pricing increase of about 4% to help offset incremental inflation pressures, especially in dairy, tortillas and packaging as well as pockets of wage pressure throughout the country.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.4%, about flat to last year. The benefit of menu price increases offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in avocado, packaging, dairy, beef and chicken. In Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be about 30% of sales as the benefit from the menu price increase will be partially offset by the higher cost of dairy, tortillas and packaging.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 24.8%, an increase of about 30 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to take a meaningful step-up in wages last May, which is partially offset by menu price increases. In Q3, we expect our labor costs to be about 25% due to leverage from our menu price increases offsetting pockets of wage pressures across the country.\nAs Brian also mentioned, we have now completed the rollout of our labor management tool. While our teams are still learning how to use the tool, we believe it has the potential to lead to better deployment to both make-lines during peaks, which we think will eventually lead to better throughput on our front serve line and better on-time results for the DML. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 90 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases as well as a decline in delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas.\nMarketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.5%, 10 basis points above last year. In Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the mid-2% range with the full year to average right around 3%. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-14% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $130 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $7 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters, $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $106 million in underlying G&A, $25 million related to noncash stock comp and a $1 million benefit related to lower performance-based bonus accruals, partially offset by payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises.\nWe expect our underlying G&A to be around $111 million in Q3 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $136 million. Depreciation was $70 million, and we expect it to remain at this level for the rest of the year.\nOur effective tax rate for Q2 was 25.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the second quarter, we repurchased $261 million of our stock at an average price of $1,350. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $300 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $320 million remaining.\nWe opened 42 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 32 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continues to be strong, maintaining record-high new store productivity. In terms of development, we continue to navigate various challenges, including construction and permitting delays and material shortages. However, our team has done an outstanding job of anticipating these challenges and mitigating delays where possible. And we still anticipate opening between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, once we move beyond these development challenges, we expect to be able to accelerate openings and get closer to the high end of the 8% to 10% opening range.\nIn closing, I've experienced Chipotle's resiliency over the past 20 years through both great times and challenging times, and I share Brian's confidence in our ability to navigate the current environment. Looking forward, I'm excited about the growth opportunity ahead of us with a runway to more than double our restaurant base and grow AUVs beyond $3 million with a 40% flow-through.\nI want to thank our 100,000 employees in our restaurants and in support roles for their continued effort and commitment to Chipotle.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Niccol\n\nChairman & CEO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I share our first quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the 3,200 outstanding general managers and field leaders that attended our All Managers' Conference in Las Vegas last month. It was our first time together in nearly 4 years, allowing us to celebrate our general managers as well as inspire and learn from one another as we codified our 2022 strategic priorities. It truly was great to be back together again.\nChipotle's performance in the first quarter was strong despite challenges from the Omicron variant. For the quarter, sales grew 16% to reach $2 billion, driven by a 9% comp. In-store sales grew by 33% over last year. Digital represented 42% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 20.7%, a decrease of 160 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $5.70, representing a 6.3% growth over last year. And we opened 51 new restaurants, including 42 Chipotles.\nAlthough our restaurant margins remain bumpy due to inflation, we have the ability to be patient while costs are volatile, and the growth in pricing power to recover our margins over time. And I'm pleased to report that Q2 is also off to a strong start, fueled by Pollo Asado our most popular new protein to date.\nOur 5 key strategies continue to position us to win today while we create the future. These include: number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.\nLet me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, starting with restaurant operations. Our people are our greatest asset and well trained and supported employees preparing delicious food served quickly equates to an excellent guest experience. We are currently focused on improving our throughput as our sales continue to increase throughout the spring, and our in-restaurant business continues to grow.\nRecently, I was in Denver at our 6th & Broadway location, which opened in March of 2000, and I met 2 employees who have been with this restaurant since the day it opened, so it's 22 years. They were training our new team members online, demonstrating how to execute with excellence and speed. It was incredible to see our teach and taste Chipotle value being brought to life. We know throughput, a foundational element of convenience that our guests value, is an opportunity for us, and we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience.\nWe have daily goals in place for the number of entrees per 15-minute period on the front make-line and promised time execution on the digital make-line. These goals are now included in the restaurant manager and crew bonuses to better drive performance and accountability, and both measures improved during the quarter. We are also in the process of rolling out a new scheduling tool, which will help ensure the right people are in the right positions at the right time.\nI believe that we are finally getting back to pre-pandemic operations, and I couldn't be more excited. We have been intentional in our recruiting efforts, and we have made investments in our people. We offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education, and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees as our staffing levels are better today than they were in late 2019.\nWe are constantly looking for ways to be better at training and development. With that in mind, we have enhanced our training and development programs, recently rolling out an AI-based learning management system, the Spice Hub, which offers immersive learning and development opportunities and upskilling for future roles for all employees. We believe our team members of today will be our leaders tomorrow, and we are looking for them to grow with us.\nOpening 8% to 10% new restaurants per year means we need more crew, more GM's, more field leadership. In fact, team members can advance the restaurateur, the highest general manager position in as little as 3.5 years with average compensation of $100,000, while leading a multimillion dollar growing business. And it doesn't stop there. A GM can become a certified training manager, a field leader, a team director and a regional vice president. In fact, we just recently promoted an individual to regional vice president, who started as a crew member and he's the second one of our regional vice presidents to share this incredible career trajectory.\nOur marketing team continues to do a tremendous job of keeping Chipotle relevant in culture, driving difference as well as transactions. We continue to leverage both traditional and nontraditional media to increase awareness and amplify the brand. You may have seen our Knowing Taste Better television campaign, which highlights Chipotle's real ingredients like antibiotic-free chicken, freshly prepared food like our hand-mash guac and features our real team members. Additionally, we remain a leader in the digital space with our latest Chipotle Metaverse experience that launched on National Burrito Day, garnering more than 4 million game plays in the first week.\nFrom a product innovation standpoint, we generally introduce 2 to 3 new menu items per year using a disciplined stage gate approach to innovation. These new product introductions are extremely effective as they bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users and increase check while giving us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand.\nPollo Asado was our first chicken innovation in 29 years, and the reaction has been outstanding. In addition to adding new variations to our health-oriented Lifestyle Bowls in January, we also attracted new guests with our plant-based Chorizo limited time offering, which prove that you don't have to sacrifice flavor or food with integrity to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein.\nAnd we're far from being done. We've got an exciting new menu item that will start testing in the coming weeks, which I think guests are going to love. We have a robust product pipeline for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nA key part of guest engagement is our Chipotle Rewards program, which now has nearly 28 million members. We recently celebrated the 3-year anniversary of the program by relaunching Guac Mode, an exclusive benefit for Chipotle Rewards members that unlocks access to surprise free guac rewards throughout the year. which resulted in our highest social engagement of all time and loyalty enrollments up 35% week-over-week.\nWe continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys that can influence guest behaviors as well as make their experience with Chipotle more relevant for them. This approach uses personalized messaging to learn more about an item the guest has previously ordered, view their ordering preferences or to see their cumulative real foodprint, which is a guest potential environmental impact based on their order history. We are constantly learning, evolving and optimizing to drive more frequency with rewards members. We are pleased with the progress to date but believe we will get even better over time. Our ability to share relevant personalized communications with our guests will ultimately deepen the relationship between rewards members and the brand.\nOur digital sales remain a big part of our business due to it being a convenient frictionless experience that has been enhanced by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution. On average, it only takes about 10 minutes from the time a guest places an order until it's ready for pickup, which is simply outstanding. Chipotlanes also continue to outperform non-Chipotle locations due to the convenience, which is encouraging since digital order pickup is our highest margin transaction. We continue to look for ways to increase access and convenience through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program.\nAs a people-first company, we are investing in human capital technology to enhance the team member experience in our restaurants, creating a more efficient, consistent and compliant environment. We recently rolled out a new labor scheduling program as well as began testing radio frequency identification technology to enhance traceability and inventory systems. Also in test is an autonomous kitchen assistant, Chippy that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips in our Cultivate Center innovation hub. Our goal is to drive efficiencies through collaborative robotics that will enable Chipotle's team members to focus on other culinary tasks in the restaurant. We will not sacrifice quality and deliciousness. We are going to place Chippy in a Southern California restaurant soon so we can leverage our stage gate process to listen, test and learn from our crew, and guest feedback before deciding on our implementation strategy.\nTo accelerate our strategic priorities, we recently announced that we created a new venture fund called Cultivate Next to make early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission. As a digital disruptor, we are looking to support early-stage companies that are forward-thinking and will enhance our employee or guest experience, advance our food with integrity mission and perhaps, revolutionize the restaurant industry.\nOur last strategic pillar is to expand access and convenience, which today is still a top request from consumers. In less than 30 years, we reached 3,000 restaurants with over half in the last 10 years. We are relentless in our pursuit of bringing food with integrity to more communities. We're not even halfway to our goal of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America and are building a real estate pipeline that will accelerate new unit growth in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with more than 80% of new restaurants featuring a Chipotle.\nOur digital order drive-through pickup lane continues to be a favorite among guests, giving customers more easy ways to access Chipotle.\nLast week, we issued Chipotle's 2021 sustainability report update, which highlights our commitment to people, food and animals and the environment. We've even tied a portion of our executive compensation to achieving various goals to ensure we held ourselves accountable for making business decisions that cultivate a better world. The report talks about how we invested in our people, supported our communities and worked to reduce our environmental impact. I'm proud of the strides that we have made to showcase real, meaningful action and measurable change.\nIn closing, none of the results that I've shared with you today would be possible without our world-class teams. I want to thank our employees in the restaurants, field teams and support center staff for constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. As I mentioned at the start, we just brought together 3,200 of our general managers and field leaders and hearing their ideas, passion and enthusiasm for this company convinced me more than ever that we have the right people and the right strategies in place to position Chipotle for accelerated growth in the years ahead.\nWith that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nCFO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 9%. Restaurant level margin of 20.7%, decreased 160 basis points compared to last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.70, representing a 6.3% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, slightly offset by a reduction of legal expenses, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.11, leading to GAAP EPS of $5.59.\nAs we look to the remainder of 2022, there remains uncertainty from macroeconomic impacts as well as COVID and make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. Comps in April so far continued right around the same 9% we saw in Q1. And while it's difficult to predict the comp in Q2 due to these factors, assuming current sales trends continue, we expect it to be in the 10% to 12% range as we expect the comp to increase throughout the quarter.\nOur restaurant level margins continue to be impacted by unprecedented levels of inflation. Our Q1 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we expected, primarily from avocados, tortillas and dairy resulting in our Q1 margin falling below the nearly 22% guidance we provided on our last earnings call. To offset these rising costs, we increased menu prices over 4% at the end of the quarter.\nAnd looking ahead to Q2, we expect our restaurant level margin to be around 25%, which will benefit from a full quarter of the new menu prices and assuming we don't see additional inflation above our current estimates.\nI'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were at 31%, an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. Costs were higher across the board, but most notably beef, avocados and paper and more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases. Additionally, cost for avocados, tortillas and dairy increased during the quarter. And in Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain near 31% as the benefit from our menu price increase will be offset by a full quarter of these elevated costs.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 26.3%, an increase of about 140 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to increase average wages to $15 per hour in May of last year, which was partially offset by menu price increases. In Q2, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid-24% range due to leverage from our menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales.\nOther operating costs for the quarter were 16.4%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases as well as a decline in delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas.\nMarketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.5%, the same level we spent last year to support plant-based Chorizo as well as the launch of Pollo Asado. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid- to high 2% range with the full year to remain around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-14% range.\nG&A for the quarter was $147 million on a GAAP basis or $144 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification through 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses, offset by a $1 million reduction related to legal settlements. G&A also includes $101 million in underlying G&A, $20 million related to noncash stock compensation, $6 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises and $17 million related to our All Manager Conference. We expect our G&A -- underlying G&A to be around $104 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth.\nWe anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $5 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises bringing total G&A in Q2 to around $136 million.\nDepreciation stepped up in the quarter to $72 million as we accelerate depreciation for several in-store tech items we plan to upgrade this year. For example, adding contactless payment for our in-restaurant guests as well as for remodels and relocations that will expand our Chipotlane footprint. We expect depreciation to remain at an elevated level for the next few quarters.\nOur effective tax rate for Q1 was 16.7% for both GAAP and non-GAAP, and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at stock prices above their brand value. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $260 million of our stock at an average price of $1,490. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.\nWe opened 51 new restaurants in the first quarter, of which 42 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continue to be strong, driving our new store productivity to record levels. The development team continues to do a tremendous job delivering new restaurants despite the many issues we're facing, including structured labor shortages, permitting delays and raw material and equipment shortages. Although these issues have lengthened the time line of our new restaurants, our pipeline continues to be strong, and we expect to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane.\nLet me end by expressing my appreciation to our over 100,000 team members in our restaurants and field leadership teams and in our restaurant support centers for their efforts to serve and delight our guests. I was thrilled to see our general managers and field leaders at our All Manager Conference last month and personally thank them for their dedication and hard work over the past several years and share with them the opportunity that they all have as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants in the years to come.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Niccol\n\nChairman & CEO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was an outstanding year for Chipotle, highlighting the organizational strength and resiliency of our brand. Despite an unprecedented environment, our employees remain passionate about their work, dedicated to delivering excellent guest experiences and aligned with our purpose and values. Our business is as much about people as it is about food, and I strongly believe that we have the best in the industry. I'm very grateful for our team members' monumental efforts. And together, we accomplished many incredible things and accelerated business momentum, all of which was fueled by our multipronged growth strategy.\nFor the fiscal year, this resulted in sales growing 26% to reach $7.5 billion driven by a 19.3% comp; digital sales of $3.4 billion, which grew 25% versus the prior year; restaurant-level margin expanding 520 basis points year-over-year to reach 22.6%; adjusted diluted EPS of $25.42, representing 137% growth over last year; and we opened 215 new restaurants.\nI'm also delighted with our fourth quarter performance even with the surge in Omicron cases that began in December. For the quarter, we reported sales of $2 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant-level margin of 20.2%, was 70 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.58, representing an increase of 60% year-over-year; digital sales growth of nearly 4% year-over-year, representing 42% of sales; and we opened 78 new restaurants, including 67 with the Chipotlane. We're encouraged by the recent performance but really excites us with the longer-term opportunity as we believe our powerful economic model will deliver best-in-class returns while achieving AUVs well beyond $3 million and significantly expanding the number of Chipotle restaurants in North America, which I'll elaborate on shortly.\nThere's no doubt in my mind that our 5 key strategies still have a long runway and are positioning us to win today while we create the future. We've revamped them slightly to reflect this transitioning from our turnaround phase to a sustainable growth base. These now include: number one, running successful restaurants with people, accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive digital growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings.\nLet me provide a brief update on each of these, starting with restaurant operations. The key to happy customers is a wonderful guest experience that provides consistently great-tasting food prepared and served quickly. This hasn't been easy, especially if the number of COVID cases spiked and, at times, impacted our staffing capabilities. But we're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary while adapting seamlessly to the dynamic environment. Their execution, whether it be on new menu introductions or managing the balance between digital and in-restaurant orders, has been exemplary.\nAs always, throughput remains a key focal area and something that we're determined to improve, especially as more guests come back to the front line. The critical success factor is ensuring we have proper staffing, which is currently a challenge for many companies. However, ongoing investments in our people, including competitive starting rates, enhanced benefits, debt-free degrees, development programs and transparent career progression opportunities, are resulting in better employee recruitment and retention as well as allowing us to make progress on labor challenges.\nBut we know there's more work to do, especially to support our future growth. As a result, we are focused on increasing our staffing stability through investing in human capital technology that will enhance our hourly team member experience. Specifically, we are in the process of implementing a new digital scheduling program as well as upgrading our learning management portal.\nAlso, I know we've mentioned this before, but it's worth highlighting again the importance of the GM role. Their leadership is crucial in executing the fundamentals of our business and setting the standard for how we run great restaurants every day. Additionally, our GMs helped grow the brand and the careers of countless team members, many of whom end up being top-performing leaders in our organization. In fact, during 2021, 90% of our restaurant management roles were internal promotions. Overall, we've promoted almost 19,000 team members in 2021. Our goal is to develop and retain diverse talent at every level of the organization and be the employer of choice, a message we will emphasize at our all-manager Conference in March.\nAfter all, our employees need to be ready to support the consistent demand our talented marketing team creates by making Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. This is done using different advertising channels, including traditional media, to enhance brand awareness and stay relevant.\nA wonderful example is our short animated film called A Future Begins, which is a sequel to our award-winning 2011 film Back To The Start and shines a light on the modern-day challenges the next generation of farmers are facing. While many young farmers value sustainability and ethics and farming like we do, they are struggling with new problems like climate change, technology costs and access to farmland. Launching this film is one of the ways that we are raising awareness of our mission to influence the 2023 farm bill that would facilitate equitable access to up to 1 million acres of land for the next generation of farmers.\nWe also utilized creative social media to successfully drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. We celebrated the 21-year anniversary of Boorito by providing $5 digital orders and serving up $1 million in free Booritos through a virtual Chipotle restaurant on roadblocks. We're the first restaurant brand to create a virtual experience on the interactive roadblocks platform, which resulted in Halloween 2021 having the most digital transactions of all time at Chipotle. This is a great illustration of us reaching consumers in a unique way to build sales today and the brand for tomorrow.\nEnhancing our marketing efforts is a consistent cadence of 2 to 3 new menu items per year, using a disciplined approach to innovation. Not only do these items help bring new guests into the Chipotle family, but they also drive frequency with existing users and give us another opportunity to highlight the brand.\nIn 2021, we launched cauliflower rice in January, followed that with quesadillas in March and, finally, debuted smoked brisket in September. All of these new items performed very well, driving an increase in both check size and transactions.\nIn 2022, we have already launched plant-based chorizo for a limited time across our U.S. restaurants. This entree is made using all real fresh ingredients growing on a farm, not in the lab, and proves that you don't have to sacrifice flavor to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein. It is off to a terrific start and is helping drive cultural buzz for its health and environmental benefits.\nAnd there's more on deck. Pollo Asado, the first menu innovation with chicken in our 28-year history, has been successfully validated as part of our stage-gate process, and our culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. So stay tuned.\nAnother important growth driver that accelerated during the pandemic has been our technology transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the fourth quarter, digital sales grew 4% year-over-year to $811 million and represent 42% of sales. We're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons, and our overall digital mix remained steady in what seems like a new normal. Incredibly, our full year digital sales of $3.4 billion is nearly 3.5x what we did pre-COVID in 2019. Digital has proven to be sticky as it's a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous investments, and you will likely see us increasing technology enablement for our restaurants and support centers to amplify innovation, enhance the customer experience and optimize efficiencies to improve operational execution.\nAs a result of this pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and, at times, incremental occasions. Having 2 large and growing businesses that are supported by separate make-lines makes it easy for guests to access Chipotle through different channels and is a key point of differentiation. Currently, about 2/3 of our guests use in-restaurant as their exclusive channel, with the remainder using Chipotle's digital ecosystem to conveniently access our real food. This dynamic gives us several future opportunities, including adding more guests, converting more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users and leveraging our expanding loyalty program.\nWe now have more than 26.5 million members in our rewards program, which is a key enabler of our digital flywheel. We're focusing a lot more on personalization by creating journeys, primarily for new and at-risk customers that can influence guest behaviors and ultimately drive more frequency. As the program grows and we gain more experience, we are constantly learning, evolving and optimizing. For example, offering greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards as well as gamifying the program with personalized challenges and badges that helped drive engagement and deepen relationships with our guests.\nNot only have we seen strong positive responses from our most loyal fans, but even more exciting is that these program enhancements have increased engagement from our medium and low-frequency guests. We are delighted with our progress to date and believe ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights will make us even better.\nOur last strategic driver is to expand access and convenience, which today is the #1 request from consumers. And we're listening. I'm excited to share that over the long term, we now believe we can operate at least 7,000 Chipotle restaurants in North America, up from our prior goal of 6,000 based on the success of small town opportunities that are delivering unit economics at or better than our traditional locations. We're also in the early stages of testing alternative formats, including seam locations, which, if successful, could further expand our addressable market.\nAdditionally, given healthy and improving cash-on-cash returns, we are building a real estate pipeline that will allow us to accelerate new unit growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with greater than 80% of new restaurants having a Chipotlane. And of course, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience with Chipotlanes, alternative formats, delivery and catering to provide many ways for our guests to Chipotle.\nIn closing, I can't thank our employees enough for everything they've done to elevate the brand and cultivate a better world for each other, our guests and our communities no matter what external restrictions came our way in 2021. As I've said before, challenges create opportunities, and we are now in a much stronger competitive position than we were 2 years ago.\nWhile we're still navigating through what we all hope is the last phase of this pandemic, I look forward to the future with optimism and can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Chipotle.\nOkay. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.\n\nJohn R. Hartung\n\nCFO, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We ended the year on a positive note, with sales in the fourth quarter growing 22% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 20.2% expanded 70 basis points over last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.58, representing 60.3% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification transformation costs as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.89, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $4.69.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID impacts as well as staffing and inflationary pressures that limit our visibility, and therefore, make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. These headwinds were significant in January, which also included some challenging weather, which led to a January comp of around 5%. We remain optimistic that as these challenges ease that our comps will accelerate from the January level. While it's difficult to predict the comp for Q1 with precision, we expect it to land somewhere in the mid to high single-digit range, assuming the effects of COVID continue to subside.\nThere's no doubt our restaurant-level margin is (inaudible) in the near term. So let me provide some perspective on Q4 and what we expect moving forward. Besides ongoing labor pressures, our Q4 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we originally expected, primarily due to elevated beef and freight costs. As a result, we took a 4% menu price increase in the middle of December to help offset these headwinds.\nGiven the timing of this pricing action, it had little impact in the quarter, resulting in our Q4 margin being at the lower end of our 20% to 21% guidance range. However, if you look ahead to Q1 where we will see the pricing benefit for the full quarter, our restaurant level margin is expected to be nearly 22%. And normalizing for the elevated marketing spend expected this quarter as well as transitory COVID-related cost pressures, the underlying Q1 margin would be in the low to mid-23% range. The bottom line is that our underlying margin remains healthy, and we believe we still have pricing power to use as needed if inflation continues to rise going forward. Of course, we'll be thoughtful and patient as we consider these actions to make sure we continue to deliver an excellent value and dining experience to our guests.\nNow let me go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. While our supply chain team continues to do an admirable job keeping our restaurants and supply key ingredients and managing the cost of doing so, external challenges were quite extreme in Q4, which led to food cost being 31.6%, an increase of [60] basis points from last year. As I just mentioned, inflation on beef and freight and, to a lesser extent, avocado costs more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases.\nAs we think about Q1, the successful premium brisket LTO has ended, and we get the full benefit of our December pricing. These tailwinds will be partially offset by a full quarter of elevated beef prices as well as seasonally higher avocado pricing. As a result, we expect our Q1 food cost to be in the 30% to 30.5% range.\nLabor costs for the fourth quarter were 26.4%, an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategic decision to increase average nationwide wages to [$15] per hour in May of last year, which was partially offset by menu price increases and sales leverage. While we're expecting elevated wage inflation to continue, especially given higher exclusion and overtime pay because of the Omicron variant, our December menu price increase should provide some offset, resulting in labor costs being in the low 26% range for Q1. Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.3%, a decrease of about 160 basis points from last year, due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.6%, about 30 basis points lower than we spent last year, but as expected, 120 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support smoke brisket and the latest brand messaging under our Behind The Foil campaign. Like Q4, Q1 tends to be a higher marketing quarter to support new menu items like plant-based chorizo. Therefore, we expect marketing to be in the high 3% range in Q1 but to remain around 3% for the full year. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the first quarter.\nG&A for the quarter was $116 million on a GAAP basis or $133 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $18 million related to the proposed settlement of legal matters, $7.6 million for the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1.3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to noncash stock compensation, $1.8 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises, and roughly $1.4 million related to our upcoming all-manager conference. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $101 million in Q1 and grow slightly every quarter thereafter as we continue to make investments, primarily in technology and people to support ongoing growth. Despite the elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth, just like we did in 2021.\nWe anticipate stock comp will be likely around $30 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and subject to the 2022 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vested during the quarter as well as about $17 million related to our all-manager conference.\nOur effective tax rate for Q4 was 20.3% on a GAAP basis and 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a benefit for the write-off of uncertain tax position reserves in the fourth quarter of 2021. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased [$169] million of our stock in average price of $1,750. And we continue to -- we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock.\nWe're privileged to have the financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments, including restaurant design and real estate development growth. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 78 new restaurants in the fourth quarter with 67, including a Chipotlane. This is despite all the construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor labor issues, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays. For the full year, we exceeded our guidance and opened 250 new restaurants with 81% or 174, including a Chipotlane. We ended 2021 with 355 Chipotlanes, including 16 conversions and 11 relocation. And overall, these formats continue to demonstrate a stellar performance. Furthermore, we're gaining more confidence in our conversion and relocation strategy, which will allow us to enhance the Chipotlane opportunity and provide more access and convenience for our guests. As a result, we expect to open between 235 and 250 restaurants in 2022 with more than 80%, including a Chipotlane. And this guidance includes 5 to 10 relocations to add a Chipotlane. Looking past the pandemic, we expect to be able to accelerate openings in 2023 and beyond and move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range that Brian mentioned.\nLet me end by expressing my gratitude for our nearly 100,000 team members in the restaurants and in the support centers for overcoming countless issues in the past year to safely serve and delight our guests. Their focus and strong execution have brought us to where we are today and I believe will be critical to sustaining our industry leadership in the future.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

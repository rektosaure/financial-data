Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Betsy Frank, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Miller Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release. Unless stated otherwise, all references to growth rates are on an adjusted year-over-year basis.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Varun will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Betsy, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 3. We had another strong quarter. We capitalized on the underlying growth in vehicle production in North America and Asia Pacific while also continuing to experience strong revenue growth in nonautomotive markets. Our resilient operating model has allowed us to proactively respond to shifting global trade policies, allowing us to keep our customers connected, with minimal impact to our operations and profitability. Thanks to our in-region, for-region integrated supply chain network, underpinned by the end-to-end global visibility provided by our comprehensive supply chain digital twin.\nOur robust operating model has been validated by the Supplier Quality Excellence awards we've received from Volkswagen and General Motors this year, underscoring how Aptiv is trusted by our customers to consistently deliver high quality solutions on time. And when combined with our unique full system solutions, we're able to provide our customers with flexibility and cost savings, which expands our competitive moat and which we've leveraged to accelerate our penetration of other end markets.\nLastly, with our focus on further maximizing shareholder value, we're progressing as planned with the separation of our electrical distribution systems business by the end of the first quarter of 2026.\nMoving on to our third quarter financial performance. The strength of our product portfolio and operating execution translated into another quarter of record financial results, including revenue, operating income and earnings per share. Our third quarter bookings of $8.4 billion validate customer confidence and strong market demand for our portfolio of advanced technologies. Revenues increased 6% to $5.2 billion, reflecting strength across multiple areas of our business as well as stronger-than-expected vehicle production in North America and China.\nOperating income increased 10% to $654 million, reflecting the flow-through on volume growth and continued strong operating performance, increased operating earnings and lower share count drove record earnings per share of $2.17. And lastly, we generated $584 million of operating cash flow and deployed $250 million for share repurchases and debt paydown. Varun will discuss each of these in more detail later.\nMoving to Slide 4 to review our third quarter business bookings. As expected, customer awards accelerated in the quarter. Our portfolio of advanced technologies and track record of flawless customer service led to $8.4 billion of new business awards, including $1.6 billion in our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, $2.1 billion in our Engineered Components Group and $4.7 billion in electrical distribution systems, bringing our year-to-date new business bookings to roughly $19 billion. We exited the third quarter with momentum and our customer award pipeline remains large and is growing. We continue to expect roughly $31 billion in new business bookings for the year, although timing of some program awards slated for the fourth quarter could shift into 2026.\nLet's move on to review each segment in more detail. Moving to Slide 5 to review the third quarter highlights for our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment. Revenue was flat year-over-year, reflecting the launch of new programs and continued strong growth for Wind River. Over 20% in the quarter, partially offset by the ongoing headwinds related to the roll-off of a legacy infotainment program and the cancellation of certain programs with 2 Chinese local OEMs, both of which we discussed last quarter. Third quarter program launches reflect the breadth of our product offering. Highlights include the launch of Aptiv's New Gen 8 Radar product, which unlocks new possibilities for hands-free driving in complex urban environments with improved cost and efficiency for our customers.\nThe first high-performance cockpit controller launch from Mahindra's market-leading BE 6 and XEV 9e high-volume electric SUVs, further underscoring Aptiv's ability to support different configurations based on customer needs and several launches for ADAS controllers with leading Chinese local OEMs including Changan, incorporating an increased percentage of locally sourced components.\nMoving to new business bookings. We continue to experience strong demand for our active safety products, as well as our next-generation user experience solutions, evidenced by multiple awards with global OEMs, extending their L2 and L2+ ADAS programs, a full-stack cross-platform, next-generation in-cabin sensing solution for a major Korean OEM and awards with leading Chinese local OEMs, including Geely, Chery and Changan across numerous product lines, including advanced active safety. Wind River was awarded new business across multiple end markets, including enterprise cloud offerings for Black Box, a global leader in digital infrastructure solutions, software application and VX work RTOS on mission-critical systems for an aerospace and defense prime and real-time operating system software for industrial market applications.\nEfforts to expand Wind River's Edge AI ecosystem continue with 3 new strategic AI partnerships for this quarter, including with LatentAI to bring AI capabilities to real-time edge platforms, for mission-critical infrastructure, TORADEX to advance innovation for aerospace and defense, by uniting certifiable reliability with rapid development. And SOCE integrating its time-sensitive networking solution with VxWorks RTOS to create a scalable, secure and certifiable foundation for mission-critical applications.\nMoving to Slide 6 to review the highlights for our Engineered Components Group. Our new business awards and program launches validate the strength of our product portfolio and established position across multiple end markets. Notable program launches include high-speed connector assemblies for an all-new fully electric midsized SUV for a global OEM. High-voltage solutions for multiple Asia Pacific OEMs including connectors for a mass market electric vehicle platform with a Japanese OEM and an electrical center for Voya, Dongfeng's luxury electric vehicle brand.\nDuring the quarter, new business bookings included a cross-platform award for a large European OEM, integrating our connectors and cables into our Intercable automotive bus fare application, enabling DC fast charging. High-voltage connector awards with multiple global OEMs, including a conquest award for next-generation EV platforms, customer awards for high-speed connector assemblies across nearly a dozen OEMs, including BYD, Chery and Changan.\nInterconnects and assemblies for Alstom, Transportation, a global leader of high-end passenger rail vehicles and equipment. And interconnects across energy, data centers and A&D applications.\nTurning to Slide 7 to review our Electrical Distribution Systems business, which delivered double-digit revenue growth, reflecting solid business performance and an easier year-over-year comp. New program launches reflected the pace of new business awards, including incremental content on a major SUV platform from a large North American OEM. Multiple launches with select Chinese local OEMs that are focused on increasing their penetration of global markets, including [indiscernible] motor and SAIC. And the launch of our first program in the energy storage sector, demonstrating a market where automotive expertise easily translates.\nMoving to new business awards. We continue to book programs across low- and high-voltage architectures as well as geographic regions. During the quarter, we were awarded incremental volume for a global OEM's top-selling North American truck platform, as well as low- and high-voltage architectures for U.S.-based global EV manufacturers autonomous mobility program. We also booked over $1 billion of new business in China, a significant portion of which was with local OEMs, including Chery, Great Wall Motor, Changan and Xiaomi.\nTurning to Slide 8. Before I pass the call to Varun to take you through our financials in more detail, I'd like to briefly discuss our updated 2025 outlook and the setup heading into next year. As Varun will discuss, we're raising our full year 2025 guidance, reflecting the strength of our third quarter results, partially offset by recent customer-specific production disruptions and an outlook for the fourth quarter that prudently incorporates an element of conservatism to reflect the amplified trade tensions beginning to impact semiconductor supply chains. Although it's early in terms of providing explicit guidance for 2026, as we sit here today, we're confident that our revenue growth will accelerate next year, driven by new automotive program launches and continued double-digit revenue growth in the other end markets we serve.\nHowever, the macro environment remains very dynamic with changing geopolitical trends, regulations and trade policies as well as customer-specific challenges, all of which are difficult to precisely forecast. Regardless, our team remains relentlessly focused on navigating the challenges in the current environment, policy serving our customers and delivering strong financial results that increase shareholder value. And we'll continue to provide you with as much visibility as possible into the macro dynamics we're facing.\nLastly, the separation of our EDS business, which we'll talk more about at our Investor Day in a few weeks will result in 2 independent companies that are well positioned to pursue their unique market opportunities and capital allocation strategies and will unlock incremental value for shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Varun to go through our financial results and our full year and fourth quarter guidance in more detail.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive Vice President & CFO\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our third quarter financials on Slide 9. Aptiv delivered record financial results in the third quarter, reflecting strong execution in a better-than-expected vehicle production environment, double-digit growth in non-auto end markets, the timing of certain customer settlements as well as the benefits of ongoing capital allocation initiatives. Revenues were a record $5.2 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income grew 9% and 10%, respectively, also reaching record levels. And operating income margin expanded 30 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume flow-through, manufacturing performance and the benefits from our ongoing cost initiatives.\nThese efforts helped offset the unfavorable impact of FX and commodities, a 130 basis point headwind to margin on a consolidated basis, largely driven by the impact of the Mexican peso and [ copper ].\nEarnings per share totaled $2.17, an increase of 19%, reflecting the flow-through of higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher tax expense versus the prior year due to the timing of certain discrete items. Operating cash flow was also strong in the quarter, totaling $584 million and capital expenditures were $143 million.\nBefore we go into details on the quarter and our updated outlook for the year, I wanted to discuss the noncash goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the third quarter and is excluded from our adjusted results. The impairment charge of $648 million for Wind River is the result of our regular impairment testing of our reporting units. The charge reflects slower than originally expected growth in the business over 2023 and 2024 going to delays in 5G adoption and the launch of software-defined vehicles. That being said, this impairment does not change our expectation for the long-term structural growth and value that Wind River represents for our business overall as evidenced by solid double-digit growth year-to-date and our expectation to deliver mid-teens growth in 2025.\nTurning to the next slide and looking more closely at third quarter adjusted revenue growth on a regional basis. In North America, revenue grew 14%, driven by double-digit growth in AS and UX, primarily within Active Safety and Wind River, while EDS also grew double digits. In Europe, revenue was down 3%, driven largely by AS and UX, while both ECG and EDS grew low single digits. And in China, revenue was flat, which reflected the impact of unfavorable customer mix in the AS & UX segment that we discussed last quarter, offset by strong growth in ECG.\nMoving on to our segment performance on Slide 11. And again, I'll refer to revenue growth on an adjusted basis. Starting with AS & UX, revenue of approximately $1.4 billion was in line with the prior year with strong growth in Wind River up over 20% and strength in our North America business, which was offset by the roll-off of legacy infotainment program and customer mix in China, headwinds we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, we expect these dynamics to continue through the end of this year before abating into next year. AS & UX adjusted operating income was down 16%, which reflected a $21 million headwind associated with lapping of a customer settlement from a year ago, which I discussed last quarter. Excluding this item, and unfavorable FX of 80 basis points, margin would have been essentially flat in the segment.\nFor ECG, revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% and was driven principally by growth in China, more specifically, nearly 30% growth with local OEMs and continued strong growth in the non-auto end markets. ECG adjusted operating income grew 10% and margin expanded by 20 basis points, driven by flow-through from stronger volumes, which was partially offset by a 120 basis point impact of unfavorable FX and commodities.\nLastly, for our EDS business, revenue of $2.3 billion increased 11%. This was driven by growth across all regions, though principally North America, which benefited from an easier comparison as one of our major customers took substantial production downtime in the third quarter of last year. In addition to benefiting from strong EV production ahead of the EV tax credit phaseout. EDS adjusted operating income grew by 54% with over 200 basis points of margin expansion. This was driven by favorable volume flow-through, performance in manufacturing and timing of a $15 million customer recovery, all of which more than offset a 150 basis points impact of unfavorable FX and commodities.\nNow let's review our balance sheet on the next slide. We generated $584 million of operating cash flow in the third quarter with the increase versus the prior year, owing primarily to higher earnings and also lower net working capital. We ended the third quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash and $4.2 billion in total liquidity. This is net of nearly $250 million in proactive capital allocation in the quarter, including $96 million of share repurchases and $148 million of debt pay down. Since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, we have deployed approximately $3.2 billion in cash towards share repurchases, including our ESR program.\nAdditionally, we have paid down roughly $1.2 billion of debt on an LTM basis, net of $700 million of refinanced euro notes. Given the strength of our operating model and our balance sheet, we expect to continue these efforts through the end of the year. With gross leverage now at 2.4x and net leverage at 1.8x, our net leverage is now consistent with the levels prior to our ASR program.\nTurning now to our guidance, which we are raising for the full year. Starting with our growth outlook on Slide 13. We now forecast active weighted global vehicle production to be approximately flat for full year 2025, equating to approximately 95 million units, and this is consistent with the industry's performance year-to-date. Relative to our prior 2025 outlook, this reflects stronger volumes in China and North America. Based on our vehicle production assumptions, we expect full year adjusted revenue growth at the midpoint of our guidance to be up 2% on a global basis, including North America up 5%, Europe down 3% and China down 1%. For the fourth quarter specifically, we forecast Aptiv weighted global vehicle production to be down 3%. Within this production backdrop, we expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth in North America to be up 7% driven by growth in AS & UX as a result of new product launches, continued growth at Wind River as well as growth in EDS. Europe, down 4%, driven by low to mid-single-digit declines across all segments and China down 4%, reflecting customer mix in the AS & UX segment.\nMoving on to other components of our guidance. Our full year revenue outlook of $20.3 billion at the midpoint continues to reflect an adjusted growth rate of 2%. The higher midpoint is largely the result of FX, primarily the euro, as well as stronger vehicle production offset by recent supply chain disruptions and production adjustments at some of our OEM customers in North America and Europe. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $3.22 billion with $2.45 billion at the midpoint, each up 4% versus the prior year. The higher midpoints largely reflect the stronger third quarter performance, offset by lower expectations for the fourth quarter, which I'll talk more about in a moment.\nAdjusted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $7.55 and $7.85, up 23% at the midpoint. This is $0.25 higher than our prior range, reflecting the higher operating income as well as the benefits of our capital allocation actions. And lastly, we continue to expect operating cash flow of approximately $2 billion and capital expenditures of roughly 4% of revenue.\nOur fourth quarter guidance implies a revenue growth of 1% on an adjusted basis at the midpoint. This is slightly below what was implied by our full year and third quarter guidance provided in July, which primarily reflects the impact of recent developments at certain customers and within the broader supply chain. Specifically, based on our current visibility into customer schedules, we estimate recent known disruptions and production adjustments at a few of our OEMs in North America and Europe creates a revenue headwind of approximately [ $80 ] million.\nBeyond this, our guidance has contemplated an element of conservatism related to amplified trade tensions impacting semiconductor supply chains. Our fourth quarter guidance implies operating income margin of 11.8% at the midpoint. Relative to our prior guidance, the margin reflects the impact of the flow-through of the known customer disruptions I just mentioned, elevated copper prices and the timing of certain customer settlements that were realized in the third quarter rather than fourth.\nLastly, we forecast fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.90. As with prior updates, our current guidance reflects our exposure to tariffs based on trade policy as it currently stands and does not include the impact of tariffs that have not yet been implemented. As a reminder, our direct exposure to tariffs is minimal in large part because of a high compliance with USMCA and our low level of non USMCA imports into the United States. In the limited areas where we have exposure and cannot change sourcing going to the industry setup, we have largely been able to pass on the incremental costs. That said, with our resilient business model and relentless focus on optimizing performance, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong execution and financial results.\nWith that, I'd now like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Varun. I'll wrap up on Slide 15 before we open the call to Q&A. We exceeded expectations in the third quarter, delivering record revenue, operating income and earnings per share, and we're well positioned to continue our strong operating performance heading into next year. Our continued strong execution despite ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment is a function of our robust business model and our proactive efforts to continually enhance our product portfolio and improve our cost structure.\nWe continue to experience strong demand for our portfolio of industry-leading products and remain uniquely positioned to benefit from the acceleration towards a more automated, electrified and digitalized feature that's happening across multiple end markets. We remain vigilant on positioning Aptiv for long-term success through proactive portfolio management and cost structure optimization with the separation of EDS being a great example of our commitment to increasing value for shareholders. We look forward to updating you more at our Investor Day in a few weeks. Operator, let's now open the line for questions."

Moving to slide five for an update on our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, where revenues declined low single digits in the quarter. The result of mid-single-digit revenue growth in Aptiv Safety and Wind River, offset by the ongoing rolloff of legacy User Experience programs we've referenced previously, and a recent slowdown in production schedules on select Zeekr and NIO programs in China. We expect these to remain headwinds for the next few quarters. Looking ahead, we executed multiple strategic program launches across each of our product lines. The highlights include an ADAS system spanning multiple brands for a leading European OEM, enhancing the performance of their current ADAS solution and enabling them to meet the latest regulatory requirements, an in-cabin sensing solution across multiple brands with a leading European OEM.\n\nOur first in-cabin sensing program with this customer, opening the door to other opportunities, and a User Experience solution for one of the flagship platforms of a luxury European OEM. Moving to new business bookings, we continue to see momentum with our flexible and scalable Gen 6 ADAS platform, as evidenced by two major awards. First, a leading North American OEM selected Aptiv PLC for their next-gen ADAS solution that runs across a range of vehicles, supporting features which scale up to hands-free driving. We're also awarded a full system ADAS program with Leap Motor, a Chinese EV OEM for the European market, which includes an RTOS from Wind River running on a China local SOC and an AI-powered vision stack from StradVision. These awards demonstrate how our global ADAS expertise, open-architected platforms, and global footprint make us a partner of choice for a wide range of OEMs.\n\nIn User Experience, we were awarded a next-generation digital cockpit program for a German luxury OEM, which incorporates Wind River Studio for over-the-air update and lifecycle management, providing enhanced connectivity, performance, and personalization. Wind River also had a range of strategic customer awards across multiple end markets, which include Wind River Studio for Hyundai Mobus, to power their software development and deployment and lifecycle management for automotive applications, Wind River Cloud Platform for a multinational telecom company, an edge platform solution and safety certification for a leading U.S. aerospace and defense prime, and an edge platform for advanced medical imaging systems with a leading healthcare equipment provider. At the same time, we expanded Wind River's edge AI ecosystem by establishing multiple strategic partnerships with AI players, including Zadata, Nota AI, Thema.AI, and DeepX, which will help advance the deployment of AI across diverse edge applications and industries.\n\nMoving to slide six to review the highlights for our Engineered Components group, which delivered solid mid-single-digit revenue growth. We launched several strategic programs and secured strong new business awards across our portfolio. Notable program launches include a high-voltage charging inlet on a luxury European OEM platform, enabling expanded charging access across multiple regions, low-voltage ECU connectors for a leading Chinese OEM's commercial vehicle program, and an up-integrated high-voltage electrical center for a large Korean OEM for next-generation electrical and electronic architectures. Moving to new business bookings, these awards underscore our role in advanced signal, power, and data distribution. During the quarter, we received high-speed cable assembly awards to enable next-generation features, including L2++ hands-free driving for local Chinese OEMs such as BYD, Geely, and Changmen.\n\nIntercable Automotive's first Bus Bar Award for a new autonomous vehicle program with a leading U.S.-based EV manufacturer, a high-voltage inlet award for a luxury European OEM, and an award for our rapid power reserve, providing highly reliable redundant power for a variety of critical functions for Sirius with Huawei systems. Notable awards outside of the automotive sector include an award in aerospace and defense with a leading manufacturer and operator of small satellites for use in low-Earth orbit and bookings for mission-critical applications from a leading U.S. defense company. Moving to slide seven to review the second quarter highlights for our Electrical Distribution System segment, which delivered solid mid-single-digit revenue growth. Beginning with new program launches, we gained incremental high-voltage content on a recent launch of a refreshed vehicle platform from a U.S.-based global EV manufacturer.\n\nWe also launched a high-voltage battery wiring program for a leading Korean OEM that will be used across multiple electric vehicle programs for the Asia-Pacific market. Moving to new business awards, we continue to book programs in both high and low-voltage architectures. We increased our share of wallet on current vehicle programs with local Chinese OEMs, including Leap Motor's new flagship SUV and a new extended-range electric SUV from IM Motors, SAIC's EV brand. In India, we were awarded low-voltage harnesses for a next-gen platform with Tata and a significant low-voltage harness award on a top 10 European battery electric vehicle platform with a luxury European OEM. Turning to slide eight, I would like to provide some context on our outlook before Varoyia takes you through our update in more detail. As intended, we are providing Q3 and updating our full-year 2025 financial guidance.\n\nOur first half results benefited from stronger than forecasted vehicle production, likely reflecting some pull forward of demand. We capitalized on this market backdrop with strong manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain performance across each of our segments. Looking at the second half of the year, we remain in a period of uncertainty driven by evolving trade and regulatory policies and remain cautious that consumer demand could weaken in the back half of the year, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. Our team remains relentlessly focused on navigating the dynamic environment, serving our customers, and delivering strong financial results that enhance shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Varoyia to go through our Q2 results and Q3 and full-year 2025 guidance in more detail.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q2 financials on slide nine, Aptiv delivered record financial results reflecting strong execution, continued progress on our operational efficiency programs, and the benefit of our ASR completed in the quarter. Revenues were a record $5.2 billion, up 2% on an adjusted basis. I'll talk more about our revenue performance on the next slide. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income both grew 4%, marking record levels on an absolute basis. Operating income margin expanded 10 basis points, primarily driven by the strong performance on our operating and cost structure initiatives, including our continued footprint rotation to best cost locations. These efforts were offset by the impact of FX and commodities, which were a 120 basis point headwind on margin, largely driven by the Mexican peso, where we lack a natural operating hedge.\n\nEarnings per share was $2.12, an increase of 34%, reflecting the flow-through of higher operating income, benefits of share repurchases, net of higher interest expense, the restructuring of the Motional Joint Venture, and lower tax expense in the quarter, driven by the timing of certain discrete items. Operating cash flow was $510 million, and capital expenditures were $149 million. Turning to the next slide and looking more closely at Q2 adjusted revenue growth on a regional basis. In North America, despite vehicle production being down year on year in the region, revenue grew 3%, driven by growth in both Active Safety and electrified programs. In Europe, revenue was down 1%, slightly better than vehicle production in the region, driven by growth in commercial vehicles. In China, revenue declined 1%, which reflects the unfavorable impact of customer mix in the AFUX segment.\n\nMoving to our segment performance in slide 11, and again, I'll refer to revenue growth on an adjusted basis. Starting with AFUX, revenue of approximately $1.5 billion was down 3%, primarily driven by the two factors Kevin mentioned previously. Partially offsetting these was a 6% growth in Active Safety revenue, driven by strong volumes and take rates across major customers in North America and and Europe. AFUX adjusted operating income grew 5%, with 90 basis points of margin expansion. A 150 basis point headwind from FX and commodities was more than offset by our ongoing performance and cost savings initiatives and the lapping of a customer receivable issue in the second quarter of last year that was resolved in the third quarter. The associated settlement from a year ago will present a temporary headwind to margin next quarter.\n\nFor Engineered Components, revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% and was driven by growth in Europe and continued traction with local China OEMs, which grew by more than 30%. Engineered Components adjusted operating income declined 4%, while margin contracted by 160 basis points as flow-through from stronger volumes was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable FX, commodities, and labor inflation. Lastly, for our Electrical Distribution Systems business, revenue of $2.2 billion increased 5%. This was driven by strong volume growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, while commercial vehicle revenue grew by 17%. Electrical Distribution Systems adjusted operating income grew by 18%, with 70 basis points of margin expansion, going to strong flow-through on volume growth and execution on footprint optimization, which more than offset a 90 basis point margin headwind related to FX. Now let's review our balance sheet on the next slide.\n\nWe generated $510 million of operating cash flow in the second quarter, with the change versus prior year owing to investments in working capital. Our cash flow, as measured on a last 12 months basis, remains very strong, at well in excess of $2 billion. We ended the second quarter with over $1.4 billion of cash and approximately $4 billion in total liquidity. As I discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we paid down $175 million on our Pan-European factoring facility in early April. Year to date, we have paid down approximately $700 million of prepayable debt, well ahead of our original deleveraging schedule. With net leverage at two times, our balance sheet continues to provide us with flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives while selectively pursuing growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance, which we have updated for the full year and have established for the third quarter.\n\nStarting with revenue growth expectations on slide 13, we continue to forecast Aptiv PLC weighted global vehicle production to be down 3% for the full year 2025, equating to approximately 92.5 million units. Relative to our original 2025 outlook, this reflects stronger volumes in China, offset by slightly weaker volumes in North America. Based on our vehicle production assumptions, we expect adjusted revenue growth at the midpoint of our guidance to be up 4% in North America, driven by content growth with key customers, as well as growth in commercial vehicles. Down 1% in Europe, slightly better than vehicle production in the region, and down 2% in China, which largely reflects our revenue mix between the local OEMs and multinational JVs.\n\nFor the third quarter specifically, we forecast Aptiv weighted global vehicle production to be down 2% and adjusted revenue growth in North America to be up 9%, with strength across all end markets and partially reflective of an easier comparison from a year ago. Europe is down 1%, driven largely by low production in the region, and China is down 4%, driven by customer mix across all segments. Moving on to other components of our guidance, our full-year revenue outlook of $20.15 billion at the midpoint continues to reflect a 2% adjusted growth rate, with higher midpoint a function of favorable FX. We expect low single-digit adjusted growth at each of our three segments. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $3.19 billion and $2.42 billion at the midpoint, up 3% and 2% respectively, and unchanged from prior guidance.\n\nWhile FX is a benefit to our top line, primarily owing to the euro, conversely, it is a headwind to our bottom line due to peso-related costs. Higher commodity prices are also a headwind, and these are being offset by stronger performance. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $7.30 and $7.60, up 19% at the midpoint. This is $0.15 higher than our prior range, reflecting a lower share count following the completion of our ASR program and favorable net interest expense as we have deleveraged ahead of schedule. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of $2 billion, $100 million lower than our prior guidance, owing to accelerating actions associated with the EDS separation that were originally slated for early 2026 into 2025. On capital expenditures, we expect these to be approximately 4% of revenue.\n\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenue growth of 3% on an adjusted basis at the midpoint, with operating income margin 11.6% at the midpoint, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.60 and $1.80. While our full-year tax rate remains unchanged at 17.5%, owing to the timing of discrete items, the tax rate in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. Looking more broadly at the full year, we remain cautious that markets could weaken in the second half, and our guidance reflects this. Combined with revised FX and commodities assumptions, this bridges the delta in our second half expectations relative to our original guidance provided in February, which we believe is prudent given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nOur current guidance reflects our exposure to tariffs based on trade policy as it currently stands and does not include the impact of tariffs that have not yet been implemented, including the copper tariffs that were announced overnight. As we have previously discussed, our direct exposure to tariffs is minimal, in large part because of our high compliance with USMCA and our low level of non-USMCA imports into the U.S. In the limited areas where we have exposure and cannot change sourcing, owing to the industry setup, we have been able to pass on the incremental costs. With our resilient business model and relentless focus on optimizing performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong execution regardless of the environment. With that, I would now like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nThanks, Baron. I will wrap up on slide 15 before we address any questions. We exceeded expectations in the second quarter, delivering record revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. We remain well-positioned to continue our strong operating performance through the balance of the year. Our continued strong execution, despite the macro uncertainty, is a function of our resilient business model and our proactive efforts around our product portfolio and cost structure to position Aptiv PLC to perform in all macro backdrops.\n\nWe continue to see robust demand for our portfolio of industry-leading products across our full sensor-to-cloud technology stack, which is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued transition toward a more electrified, automated, and digitalized future across multiple end markets and remains vigilant on positioning Aptiv PLC for long-term success through proactive portfolio management, with the forthcoming separation of Electrical Distribution Systems being a great example of our commitment to increasing value to our shareholders. Operator, let us now open the line for questions.\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We request that you limit your questions to one initial with one follow-up so that we may take as many questions as possible. Again, press star one to ask a question. We will pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. Our first question comes from Eti Mackelly at TD Cowan.\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just first question. Morning. Just first question on the degree of visibility you have at the moment for Q4 production. The guidance, I think, implies a healthy decline year over year, but pretty strong outgrowth on your part. I am just curious how far visibility do you have right now in terms of the schedules themselves?\n\nAs we've talked about previously, we get schedules out through, based on where we sit today, out through the end of the year. Obviously, the closer to where we are today, the stronger the schedule. I would say fairly firm EDI schedules typically ranging from two to four weeks out from where we sit today and then less firm as you move beyond that. At this point in time, we've not seen any significant change in schedules relative to where we were a month ago. I think there's an element of, as we look at what actually will flow through from a production standpoint, given the dynamic market, given the strength that we saw in the second quarter, given our discussions with OEMs and a view that there was some element of pull forward and that OEMs, to some extent, manage the supply base through their demand signals.\n\nWe took a relatively conservative outlook for the back half of the year, which we previously had when we initially gave guidance in February in the front half of the year. We get visibility, but just in light of the dynamics, we've decided to be somewhat conservative. I believe it's prudent to be conservative.\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks, Kevin. As a follow-up, with the changing U.S. emissions standards, some automakers are expressing an intent to shift their mix to larger vehicles and take an opportunity. I am curious whether that does present any content opportunities for you on that presumed makeshift that may happen next year.\n\nYou're talking about movement from EVs to ICE vehicles increasing?\n\nOr more just more like larger vehicles within ICE, more SUVs, kind of larger vehicles given the emission.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So to be transparent, we have already seen some of that this year. We saw some of that in the second quarter. So our outlook for growth in the EV that we originally had at the beginning of the year will certainly end up below our original outlook. That has been more than offset with both production schedules as well as content, certainly on large trucks in North America. So we have, in fact, offset that headwind from a slowdown of EV adoption in North America.\n\nWe'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\n\nYes. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I had a question on the bookings target of $31 billion. You spoke to award progress in some areas, but also an uncertain macro backdrop. The bookings target is 2H weighted. Can you help investors better understand the visibility you have into reaching the $31 billion full-year target and any key drivers that you see that would contribute to the increase in bookings in 2H?\n\nYeah. So there is a cadence for bookings. I would say we have a very strong funnel with significant visibility to booking. I would say we have a high level of confidence that they will achieve the target that we've presented to investors. I would also tell you it's taking a little bit longer to get bookings finalized and documented. Just in light of the environment we're in, the reality is our OEM customers across the globe are spending a lot of time kind of managing through the evolving trade and regulatory landscape, in addition to working with suppliers like ourselves on new business awards. So I would say we have a reasonable level of confidence that we'll be back and loaded. We saw some amount of protracted periods between RFQs and awards last year, and we had a strong year last year.\n\nI think you'll continue to see us have a strong year this year as well.\n\nThanks for that, Kevin. My other question was in the non-automotive areas. The company's had a goal of diversifying and better addressing some of these other areas, industrial, aerospace, defense. Can you speak a bit more on what you're seeing there and whether or not you were able to grow faster in some of these non-automotive end markets? Thanks.\n\nGrowth has been certainly strong in the first quarter. It was kind of a low single digit this quarter. In the back half of the year, based on our visibility, we believe it will be solid double-digit growth. I mentioned during my prepared comments from a booking standpoint, both within the Engineered Components business as well as the Advanced Safety and User Experience business awards in the industrial sector, whether it is aerospace and defense or, broadly speaking, industrial. We will end this year with actually that particular customer category or sector being our fastest growing market. We are making significant progress and gaining traction.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe'll go next to Dan Levy with Barclays.\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nMorning.\n\nI want to start with a question on the implied growth in the second half and specifically the implied growth over market. I think in the first half, the growth over market or your organic growth relative to underlying active markets was something like 1 to 2 points. You are guiding to, I believe, for the full year, roughly 5 points. So there is some acceleration in the back half on that outgrowth. Maybe you could just talk about some of the assumptions in the second half growth change.\n\nI think first, when you look at growth on a year-over-year basis, you certainly need to focus on Q4 of last year and what we saw from a global vehicle production relative to current outlooks, ours or IHS. You have to keep that in mind. When you unpack our acceleration of growth in the back half, where you see the most significant pickup is certainly within the Advanced Safety and User Experience. Within the Advanced Safety and User Experience business, you also see significant pickup in growth as it relates to our Electrical Distribution Systems business. Those would be the two biggest drivers. I would say from an overall growth rate, Engineered Components stayed roughly in line with how it has grown year to date.\n\nIf you unpack Advanced Safety and User Experience, a big piece of that is the ongoing launch of ADAS programs principally in North America and Europe, partially offset by that reference to the two Chinese OEM programs that will be a headwind, but we will still see acceleration and growth. At Electrical Distribution Systems, we see strong growth continuing, certainly in the third quarter, part of that year-over-year comp, and then actually slowing a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is also a, if you remember, fourth quarter last year, Electrical Distribution Systems had a very strong fourth quarter last year. The comp is pretty tough.\n\nGreat. There's not one specific launch that you're dependent on or that this is weighted to, correct?\n\nNo. Listen, we're launching this year, we'll launch over 2,500 programs, Dan. So it's multiple programs that are being launched during the year that affect that back half and five.\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. The second question is around capital allocation. Maybe you could just revisit the framework specifically with the Electrical Distribution Systems spin. Now it sounds like you are pulling that forward. How should we think about capital allocation dynamics in the future post-Electrical Distribution Systems spin? Especially on the inorganic side, what types of targets you may be seeking?\n\nSure. First, we are not pulling the EDS spin forward. We are still on a path where we will spin the business at the end of the first quarter of 2026. We are obviously, given the size of that business, there is a lot of time spent by management focusing on moving that, continuing to move that forward. So I want to make sure I correct you on that. As it relates to capital allocation, starting with the EDS spin, that is a business that we are very focused on having very manageable leverage out of the gate. So there will be an element of leverage on that business and a dividend to Aptiv PLC.\n\nThat cash will be used to pay down some amount of debt. We will continue to deleverage during the back half of this year and into 2026, certainly at RemainCo, partly as a result of earnings growth, partly as a result of select debt paydown. When we look at priorities from a capital allocation standpoint, as of right now, we have made the decision for the first couple of quarters that we are going to really sit on cash, evaluate the environment. We will continue to sit on cash during this quarter. Priorities are really first M&A opportunities in the Engineered Components and in the Advanced Safety and User Experience space, principally in assets that have exposure outside of the automotive market.\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nWe'll go next to Joe Spak with UBS.\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin, just to start, just a few points of clarification. When you are saying second quarter pull forward to demand, I just want to be sure you are talking about consumer demand of vehicles and you shipping to that, or do you think there was actual channel inventory builds, like you shipped more than production? I will let you answer that.\n\nI think an element of both the schedules we receive from our customers and the number of vehicles our customers produced. I think it is a mix. Obviously, those two are aligned. I think, Joe, it is difficult to be precise on how much of that took place. Based on our dialogue with customers and the timing of changes, I think it is reasonable to assume that there is some element of pull forward in production.\n\nFair enough. The second clarification just on the implied Q3, Q4 guidance, it looks like revenue is really pretty flat Q3 to Q4, but a big step up in margins. Is that just sort of the normal seasonality you see in engineering recoveries, or is there anything else that sort of drives that fourth quarter margin higher than the third quarter?\n\nFrom a year-over-year growth rate, it is really important that you look at the prior quarters. To a certain extent, we were impacted slightly differently by business Q3 and Q4 last year. If you look at overall production, you will see a few anomalies in Q3 and Q4. Q4 vehicle production last year was the highest Q4 it has been in. I think you can go back for a very long period of time, and I think on a sequential basis, it was up four-quarter growth rate on a year-over-year basis. A portion of our business, especially our Electrical Distribution Systems business, gets impacted. Q3, given our customer mix in Q3, obviously, you will see strong growth there. So I think it is important you look at it that way.\n\nI think as you look at margin, how margin plays out in Q3, Q4, it is really about the continued benefit of the cost actions we have taken last year and this year and the timing associated with those. Then it is, to your point, Joe Spak, it is the timing of engineering credits, which tend to be back and loaded in our business, principally more of that in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.\n\nOkay. Then second question, just on the 85% of your day bookings with the local Chinese OEMs, does that tend to come on quicker than some other bookings you have? We have heard from some other suppliers, there could be a pretty short period of time from when to launch, like around the year. Then maybe you could just shed a little bit of light on what is really driving this acceleration, how you are winning. Is it just a refocus on those customers? Are there new products or any major differences in profitability, anything like that?\n\nListen, we have been talking about this for quite some time. I would not say it is a new focus. It is a focus we have had for the last couple of years where we are making progress. Joe, you are familiar with our China team. It is a China-based team that is localized. Our product capabilities, our engineering capabilities, manufacturing, and supply chain are all focused on the China market and have been for a very, very long period of time. I think it is the strength of our product portfolio. I think we leverage our global scale. I referenced in my prepared comments the award for Leap Motor for their European vehicles, our Gen 6 ADAS solution. We have other awards across our segments that relate to programs in China and outside of China.\n\nThe major players we have business awarded for both export as well as for programs that they are launching out of Europe or South America. There is more to come there. It is an area we continue to focus on. To your point, in terms of between award and launch, I would say one year is long. I would say it is six to nine months, quite frankly, at this point in time from a pace standpoint. That ranges anywhere from wire harnesses to interconnects to Active Safety or User Experience systems. It is very rapid. Having said that, it is a very dynamic environment. I made the comment about the Zeekr and NIO programs, which they are important customers, but we are on a couple of vehicle platforms, for example, with Zeekr, where those platforms are not doing well in the China market.\n\nWe saw a fairly rapid reduction in production schedules beginning in Q2 that will affect us in Q3 and Q4 that we are working through. A positive is we continue to book a lot of business, and we are confident we are able to replace that volume as we execute for and head into next year.\n\nVery helpful. Thanks.\n\nWe'll go next to Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research.\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. I wanted to get a few more thoughts from you on the trajectory of Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues. They were down 3% in the quarter. You flagged some roll-offs of legacy User Experience programs, and then some unfavorable mix in China. Generally, can you lay out the growth narrative for this business? I think you have launches in the back half. How should we think about a forward growth trajectory for Advanced Safety and User Experience?\n\nYeah. So it's a great question. It's a business that sits in a place where content per vehicle is growing. As you know, we have a headwind that we've talked about in terms of that legacy User Experience program. When you look at our overall growth rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, year-over-year basis, however you want to look at it, it's worth 200 to 300 bps as that program winds down. We get to finally lapping it beginning in Q1 next year. So that wind-down ends at the end of the fourth quarter of this year. So that's had over the last, this past year, certainly an impact on our overall growth rate. Active Safety, our outlook for Active Safety is that it'll grow roughly 6% this year, so mid-single digits. That, unfortunately, is a bit impacted by the China programs that I just mentioned, those OEM programs I mentioned.\n\nA couple of those are actually ADAS programs. So that is a bit of a headwind. But as you head into 2026, we're confident that we're in that kind of mid-single-digit sort of growth rate as it relates to the ASUX business, just given new program launches as well as that headwind coming to an end, that User Experience headwind coming to an end.\n\nThat's very helpful. The second topic for me, I wanted to ask you about the ECG margins. They decreased in the quarter versus last year, even though organic revenues were actually up a very good clip. Maybe some effects in commodities in there. I guess more generally, where do you think ECG margins can go?\n\nListen, this quarter was all FX and commodity prices. That was the headwind. We are facing significant headwinds, principally as it relates to the pay stub. We are hedged down to 19. I will let Varun Laroyia talk about it. That has been a significant headwind for that business, for the margin profile of our Electrical Distribution Systems business, and to some extent, lesser extent, our Advanced Safety and User Experience business. Varun, I should let you answer this.\n\nYeah, I think, Kevin, you've pretty much answered that. If you think of the points that Kevin just mentioned, and as you think of the second half of the year, we do see the seasonal uptick in margins in the ECG business also. So outside of the FX piece that we've pulled out, Mexican peso, we do see ECG margins recovering in the second half of the year.\n\nIn terms of EBITDA margin opportunity, where we sit today from an EBITDA standpoint, we will end the year at, I do not know, roughly 22% sort of EBITDA margins. We will continue to see those increase. In 2022, they were at under 20%. So we have seen significant improvement in margins as we continue to grow, especially outside of automotive in the industrial sectors where our margin rates are much higher. Just to remind everybody, for us in this business, that sector is growing faster than our traditional automotive sector. We will naturally see an accretion to margins as well.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nWe'll go next to Chris McNally with Evercore.\n\nHi, Kevin. Thanks so much, team. I appreciate the conservatism. I think we all know there's a lot that needs to happen, particularly around the Mexico trade deal, which seems next. Kevin, that's sort of my first high-level question. You guys are always pretty connected in D.C. If we step back, what do you think the industry is asking for at this point? Is it sort of 15% like all the other countries, or is there a case that USMCA compliant vehicles could get something better? Just curious, super high level, what you think the industry is asking for, or really, in your opinion, should be asking for for good policy going forward?\n\nYeah. I try to avoid political policies. We can share with you our view. USMCA will definitely stay in place. There will be some recalibration of certain aspects of USMCA. The administration is focused on bringing high-paying jobs back to the U.S. Our OEM customers in North America are supportive of that and are working with them to do that. So that will be the principal target. I cannot answer, Chris. I am not smart enough whether there will be a lever where, to the extent vehicles reach some sort of U.S. content but manufactured in Mexico, whether or not they will be subject to a lower tariff regime or not. I can say for us, I think this is the important thing and Varun Laroyia talked about, I talked about in his prepared comments. For U.S. production, 95% of our product comes from Mexico.\n\n99% of that is USMCA compliant. The announcement yesterday with respect to copper tariffs that will not work, we are clear that will not impact wire harnesses. So that will not be an issue for us. As we size a potential headwind based on what we know now, and we still do not have the information to give precise estimates, but it is relatively small and something that we can manage. So from our standpoint, whether the vehicle is manufactured in Mexico or it is manufactured here in the U.S., given how we are positioned and given how we think things will play out, we are in a good place.\n\nNo, that's great. I appreciate the sensitivity, Kevin. I think it's only interesting because we're now starting to hear public discussions from players like VW on their call talking about almost OEM-specific deals for reshoring. Obviously, you had players like Aptiv PLC, big customers that are already announcing that. Look, it's going to be an exciting August and September on that front. We'll stay tuned. The last thing, just as that relates to your guidance then, is it fair to say that that minus 6% is sort of an industry number where we all were assuming a kind of rough Q4 based on tariff-related pricing? Is it okay to paraphrase that your minus 6% almost implies no new deal and that OEMs have to put through price and SAR goes down, so production goes down?\n\nIs that a fair case that that's sort of the conservatism here is assuming that we have to have price and negative SAR as a result? If something's better than that, then maybe this will have an upside.\n\nYeah. I think it is two things. I think it is a year-over-year comp with Q4 last year from a vehicle production standpoint. The presumption is that we have weaker consumer demand, whether that is driven by vehicle pricing or other issues that consumers are wrestling with, which obviously affects OEMs and OEM production, right? Chris, just taking a step back, as we look at the world, our presumption when we gave guidance in February was we were going to be more immediately impacted by tariffs under the presumption they were going to be implemented much sooner. They have not been. Our reasonably educated view is that there was some pull forward of production by our North American customers. I cannot give you an exact number. Now we have that same concern we had back in February for the back half of this year.\n\nIf we are wrong and vehicle production is stronger, we will benefit, just like we did in Q1 and Q2. Sitting here today, we felt the most prudent thing to do was to be a bit more, and I do not know if you want to call it conservative. That will depend upon what plays out, that we should assume that there is an impact on vehicle production in the back half, given the implementation of changing trade policies and tariffs.\n\nAbsolutely, Kevin. Makes complete sense.\n\nWe'll go next to Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.\n\nOh, great. Thanks for checking my questions. If I look at the quarter, your mix in China, I think you were about 10% under market. You were similar and a little better in Q1. When does that start to normalize? Because especially you flagged some new wins with very short lead times. Does that actually start to narrow pretty meaningfully into the second half? How should we think about it, maybe even into next year?\n\nYeah, I think it depends. Listen, Colin, we were making significant progress over the last two years. We will continue to make progress. Our target was to be at the same mix as industrial production in China at the end of this year, or roughly at the end of this year. We are on that track. These programs that I, these vehicle programs or vehicles that I mentioned with respect to Zeekr and NIO, obviously, have a negative impact and set us back. So we will continue to focus on where can we play where we can bring the most value and obviously drive the most profitability. China is a very dynamic market right now, extremely dynamic. It is a critically important market for Aptiv. We are very focused on it.\n\nBut we are very focused on not only revenue growth, but how do we make sure that we hit the margin expansion and the return on investment as it relates to that market? We can. We are confident of that. We have a low-cost structure. We continue to aggressively reduce that cost structure by rotating engineering activities, by leveraging global platforms, by reducing our sourcing costs as it relates to our supply chain. So the team is doing a great job. But it is important that we be focused on doing business with the right customers on the right platforms and ensuring that we do not end up in minimizing the risk of being in a situation like we are talking about to you today with respect to a couple of customers on a few platforms that they have significantly reduced volumes having an impact on.\n\nSo we are working our way towards that, but our real focus is how do we grow earnings both in China as well as on an aggregate Aptiv basis.\n\nGot it. Makes sense. You also mentioned that the guide doesn't include the copper tariffs, which I guess makes sense. Is there any way to frame that in terms of, I believe most of your contracts have pass-through provisions? Is there a risk to numbers or from a dollar perspective, or is this more of a margin dilution risk?\n\nNo. This is not, this is derivative. So it's non-232, but it's manageable. Based on our analysis, and we don't have all the specifics, Varun Laroyia and I can confidently tell you this is something we can manage through from a supply chain standpoint. To the extent we're not able to offset all of it, it's something that we've been having conversations with our customers regarding, and we'll be able to push it through. Varun, you should.\n\nNo, I think that is right, Kevin. Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nWe'll go next to Tom Narayan with RBC.\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I know you guys have talked a lot about China. Just one more. On that order booked 85% to domestics, just curious if we could get a little more detail on that. I know one of the big catalysts was potentially, you know, the fact that these domestic OEMs have to expand or want to expand outside of China, particularly Europe, and that that benefits you guys. Just curious as to commentary in that regard. Is that a big factor that was driving, you know, the domestics that you were winning, or is it just kind of across the board?\n\nNo, it's a great question. It's across the board. It's across the board. We've been winning significant business, for example, with BYD over the last, in our EDS business over the last couple of years, in our EDS business over the last 12 months with opportunities in Advanced Safety and User Experience that we're working on now. Our focus is on strategic programs in China, vehicle programs, as well as, I'd say, an additional focus on where are those OEMs taking vehicles, offshore, whether that be through export or through production in Europe. There are a few of them that were spending a lot of time on their European or South American supply chain as they move production out and try to ramp up. We're in front of those particular vehicle programs, but making progress.\n\nI would say it's a bit of a two-prong, but we feel like we can bring the most value, quite frankly, or we can bring incremental value for those that need support outside of the China market.\n\nGot it. My follow-up, this is kind of more a high-level question. In your prepared comments, there were a lot of big wins, it sounded like. I was just curious as to those wins, are they mostly like on the ADAS side, are they mostly like, is there a characteristic of where these wins are more than others? I have actually forgotten my question. I am just curious as to where, if you could just comment on where those wins are specifically.\n\nYeah. So our ADAS awards are in North America, Europe, and China. We would tell you, just given cost pressure that our OEM customers are under tariff and other, they are very focused on. There is incremental focus and willingness to look at full system solutions that save them money. We talked about the award from Leap Motor, rather, for their European vehicles that include locally sourced China-based SOCs, Strategy and Vision Solution, which is our reference vision solution for our Gen 6 ADAS platform, and then our Gen 6 ADAS platform. So very cost-effective. Similarly, with the North American OEM, a different vision solution, but it is an enhancement of our existing Gen 6 ADAS solution, adding more features, more capability, more scalability, with significantly more focus on the trade-off between performance and cost of performance.\n\nI think I remember what I was going to ask. Sorry. Yes. So this is something we have been hearing from a lot of the OEMs, is, you know, the larger OEMs feel like on ADAS that, you know, there is a lot of, I want to insource. Maybe some of the smaller ones, there is a, you know, maybe a propensity to outsource more. Just curious, is that what you guys are seeing? You know, like the larger OEMs have an inclination to perhaps want to take kind of piece parts of your ADAS portfolio as opposed to the entire suite? Is that not the case that you are winning kind of across the board?\n\nWe would tell you now, we are seeing from OEMs less desire to do things internally. Now, there may be some things that, with particular OEMs, where it might be a feature or some features within an ADAS stack, but that we are going to do it all ourselves. Listen, you are familiar with the OEMs that have tried doing that, have spent money doing it, and have not been overly successful. We would say that trend is reversed for us. We would say, though, all of our OEMs are looking for open-architected solutions where they have flexibility, that that is important, that they are scalable so that they can put higher performing, high-cost systems on a more luxurious vehicle and lower-cost systems on entry vehicles. To the extent you can do that with a single platform, it is less engineering cost for them.\n\nAll of them are looking for that sort of approach to things. In a strange way, all of the cost pressure going on in the industry is actually helpful to our business model. Again, we are willing to provide the full system solution or part of the solution depending upon what the customer is looking for.\n\nThat will conclude today's question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Clark for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nThank you, operator. Thanks, everybody, for spending time with us this morning. We really appreciate your questions. Have a great rest of the day. Thanks.\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Aptiv Q2 2025 earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time and have a great day."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Betsy Frank, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBetsy Miller Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.\nThe press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items, and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our first quarter results as well as our financial outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chair and CEO; and Varun Laroyia, EVP and CFO. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Varun will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Betsy, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning.\nLet's begin on Slide 3. Aptiv started the year strong, with first quarter results exceeding our guidance range due to higher-than-expected vehicle production volumes, principally in China, and solid growth in nonautomotive end markets as well as strong operating performance, demonstrating our ability to adapt to a dynamic market environment while continuing to execute on our strategy, including the separation of our EDS business, which remains on track.\nTouching on a few of the first quarter highlights. Revenue totaled $4.8 billion, down 1% as a result of lower vehicle production in North America and Europe and negative customer mix. Operating income reached a first quarter record of $572 million, an increase of over 5%, reflecting strong operating execution and the benefit of ongoing cost reduction initiatives, which, along with share count reductions, drove earnings per share to a first quarter record of $1.69. And lastly, operating cash flow totaled $273 million, positioning us to accelerate our original deleveraging plan.\nWe completed our $3 billion accelerated share repurchase program on April 1, which reduced our share count by 18%, bringing the percentage of shares retired over the last 12 months to 20%. In summary, our team continues to do an excellent job executing on what we can control, while also addressing the evolving needs of our customers and increasing the robustness of our business model.\nTurning to Slide 4. We're confident that the long-term growth drivers of our business remain fully intact. The future is electrified, software-defined and connected, and Aptiv is well positioned to enable this transition across multiple end markets.\nHowever, we're currently in a period of uncertainty due to rapid changes in global trade policies and their impact on demand in the markets we serve, particularly in the automotive market. We've not experienced major changes to underlying demand in our business today. We delivered strong first quarter results, and our second quarter is tracking well with limited changes to OEM production schedules.\nHowever, it's difficult to determine how the changing market dynamics will impact the second half of the year. Given the situation, while we remain confident in our initial full year outlook that excluded the impact of tariffs, we'll continue to closely monitor any demand changes in the markets we serve, and we'll provide an update to our full year outlook when visibility improves, hopefully later this quarter.\nIn the meantime, we're proactively adapting our business to the evolving landscape of trade policies, customer mix and EV adoption. Our resilient business model enables us to remain agile and responsive, leveraging our in-region, for-region commercial and supply chain strategy, flexible cost structure and comprehensive portfolio of advanced technology solutions to adapt to the dynamic environment, while also addressing the needs of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 5 to provide you with additional detail on our exposure to the recent tariff announcements and the actions we're taking to mitigate any impacts on our business. We prioritize being close to our customers. And over the last several years, we've worked to establish a localized supply chain and cost-effective manufacturing footprint. As a result, our cross-regional trade exposures between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe, for example, are minimal, with the activities ongoing to further reduce any exposures.\nAs we've discussed, our principal trade exposures within North America, with more than 95% of our U.S. trade flows actually between the U.S. and Mexico. We import just under $5 billion of product annually from Mexico, of which over 99% is USMCA compliant.\nWe're working to mitigate the tariff impact by further optimizing our supply chain and identifying additional localization opportunities, shifting our manufacturing footprint, including the possibility of relocating certain high-value production to the U.S., strategically building inventory of select products to ensure flawless execution on current programs and new launches, while also preserving balance sheet flexibility, and any remaining tariff amount that cannot be mitigated will continue to be passed on to our customers. Our team is doing a great job navigating the dynamic environment, while continuing to serve our customers, maximize our operating performance and deliver value to our shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 6 to review our new business awards. Bookings for the first quarter were nearly $5 billion. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $1.3 billion, driven by Active Safety bookings of $800 million. Bookings in the Engineered Components Group reached $2.1 billion, ranging across the segment's full product portfolio and multiple end markets. And Electrical Distribution Systems bookings totaled $1.5 billion, including $1 billion in electrified vehicle platforms. We also continued our strong bookings traction in China, reaching over $1.4 billion, with over $1.2 billion of new business awards across each of our segments with local Chinese OEMs.\nWhile demand for our portfolio solution remains strong, the uncertainty related to trade policy and regulatory changes have led to delays in customer program awards, causing shifting time lines across our business. Despite these dynamics, we continue to collaborate with our customers on delivering high performance, cost-effective solutions and remain confident in reaching our target of over $31 billion in new business awards this year.\nTurning to Slide 7 to review the first quarter highlights for our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment. Revenues were flat, driven by high single-digit growth from customers in North America and over 20% growth from nonautomotive customers. Active Safety revenues increased 9% and revenues for smart vehicle compute and software grew double digits, driven by strong growth in Wind River revenues.\nWe're proud to announce that during the quarter, Aptiv won the Automotive News PACE Pilot Innovation Award for a radar-based AIML and ML behavior planner. These integrated solutions offer significant advancements over conventional software for vehicle safety, including 99% better classification rate in all weather conditions and 80% better object size estimation.\nIn addition, Wind River was ranked #1 in Edge operating systems by [ VDC Research ], retaining its long-standing position as a global market leader in real-time operating systems and embedded Linux. And last week, we showcased a broad range of fully localized solutions for the China market at the Shanghai Auto Show, which garnered tremendous interest from local Chinese OEMs and has expanded our pipeline of new business opportunities in the region.\nFurther underscoring the strength of our portfolio, bookings during the quarter included multiple awards, with leading local Chinese OEMs in Active Safety and smart vehicle compute, where our unique ability to leverage the local ecosystem has enabled us to provide solutions that meet our customers' needs at a competitive cost, an in-cabin sensing solution for a leading global OEM and Wind River software platform awards from several customers in the A&D and industrial markets. These commercial awards validate Aptiv's industry-leading technologies as well as the value that our innovation provides to our customers.\nTurning to Slide 8 for an update on our Engineered Components Group during the first quarter. Revenues increased 1%, reflecting strong growth of Chinese local OEMs, and mid-single-digit growth in traditional interconnect in specialty product revenues for the non-auto markets. ECG's ability to further penetrate new customers and markets is supported by continuous product innovation, including highly engineered solutions focused on increasing performance, while reducing weight and cost, is reflected in the recently launched [ MiniCoax ], a smaller, lighter, more flexible version of the traditional coaxial cable connectors widely used in a variety of high-speed data applications.\nAs I mentioned, ECG booked approximately $2.1 billion in new business across product lines and end markets, including a high-speed cable assembly award for Ethernet applications from a global OEM, which enables seamless data transmission for connected vehicles, and electrical center award with a luxury European OEM that will help accelerate its transition to a next-gen 48-volt architecture across multiple vehicle lines, and multiple awards in the semi fab equipment, mass transit, medical and general industrial markets.\nTurning to Slide 9 to review Electrical Distribution Systems first quarter highlights. Revenues declined 3%, principally the result of lower light vehicle production. We executed on our footprint strategy during the quarter, completing the closure of 2 additional manufacturing sites in China. We also continue to leverage our proprietary internally developed engineering software tool chain, [ I harness ], to engage with several customers on advanced development programs targeting vehicle, architecture design optimization and manufacturing automation.\nIn addition, we demonstrated strong commercial momentum as reflected in our bookings, which included over $1 billion of new business awards with leading Asia Pacific OEMs, including bookings of Xiaomi and JAC Motors in China, and our first grid energy storage award in North America. Lastly, we made progress executing our plan to position EDS as a stand-alone company. As I mentioned, we remain on track for completion of the separation by the end of the first quarter next year.\nMoving to Slide 10. Before I hand the call over to Varun, I'd like to highlight our recently announced strategic partnership with ServiceNow, which demonstrates our progress commercializing our Edge to Cloud offerings in the enterprise space. The integration of ServiceNow's AI-powered platform and CRM workflows with Wind River's cloud platform, which is a cloud-native on-premises private cloud solution, and eLxr Pro, Wind River's enterprise Linux offering for AI and mission-critical workloads, will drive intelligent automation and operational resilience across industries. This strategic partnership includes a joint go-to-market plan across our sales teams, targeting the telco automotive, enterprise and industrial sectors.\nWe also announced yesterday, an expanded partnership with Capgemini, to deliver next-generation private cloud solutions for the enterprise sector. Our joint solution combines Wind River's Cloud Platform and eLxr Pro, with Capgemini's systems integration, transformation and application modernization capabilities. These partnerships will not only expand our global reach and extend our footprint in the enterprise space, but also drive faster adoption and deployment of our technology across industries where security, performance and reliability are critical.\nI'll now turn the call over to Varun to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive Vice President & CFO\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the first quarter on Slide 11. Aptiv delivered strong financial results in the quarter, reflecting robust execution across all 3 segments, with continued progress on cost savings and margin improvement actions and cash flow generation in a backdrop of a dynamic market environment.\nRevenues were $4.8 billion, down 1% versus the prior year. And growth was impacted by lower vehicle production in North America and Europe as well as customer mix in China, in particular, for our EDS business. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income was $758 million and $572 million, respectively.\nOperating income margin expanded 80 basis points versus prior year, primarily driven by strong execution of our operating performance initiatives, including the continued rotation of our engineering and manufacturing footprint to best cost locations. These actions more than offset the impact of FX and commodities, which was a 50 basis point headwind on margin.\nEarnings per share was $1.69, an increase of 46% from the prior year, reflecting the flow-through of higher operating income as well as the benefit of share repurchases, net of higher interest expense and the restructuring of the [ Motional ] joint venture. Operating cash flow was strong, totaling $273 million, and capital expenditures were $197 million in the quarter.\nLooking at first quarter revenues on Slide 12. Revenue of $4.8 billion was driven by lower vehicle production levels, partially offset by growth from new program launches and strong growth in adjacent markets, which were up mid-single digits. Net price and commodities were a positive to the top line, while foreign exchange was a headwind of $64 million, primarily related to the Europe, China renminbi and the Korean won.\nMoving to the right panel of the slide. Despite a weaker production environment in North America, revenues were only down 2%, supported by strong growth in Active Safety. In Europe, revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by volumes on select EV platforms. And in China, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, driven by growth with several local OEMs, partially offsetting significant production volume declines with a specific EV customer.\nMoving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Revenue was flat in the quarter. Active Safety was up 9%, benefiting from new program launches and ongoing proliferation across platforms, as well as continued strong take rates in North America and Europe. User experience was down 14%, primarily driven by the roll-off of legacy programs that we have previously highlighted and were in line with expectations. We expect this trend to continue through the back end of the year before new launches related to software-defined in-cabin sensing and integrated cockpit controllers begin to ramp.\nSV compute and software revenue grew 12% due to strong commercial traction of Wind River solutions, particularly in the Aerospace and Defense and Industrial markets. Segment adjusted operating income was $155 million, with a record first quarter margin of 10.9%, up 10 basis points over the prior year, owing to ongoing performance initiatives and strong flow-through on Wind River volume growth and the continued rotation of our engineering footprint to best cost locations. These actions offset an 80 basis point margin headwind, [ owing ] to FX and commodities in the quarter.\nTurning to the ECG segment on Slide 14. Revenue in the first quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by China revenues up 24% as a result of significant traction with local OEMs, which more than offset vehicle production in both North America and Europe. Segment adjusted operating income was $274 million or 17.3%, up 140 basis points over prior year, due to operating performance initiatives across manufacturing and supply chain, including strategic sourcing, which more than offset a 90 basis point headwind from FX and commodities.\nTurning to the EDS segment on Slide 15. Revenue in the first quarter was approximately $2 billion, a decrease of 3%, driven by strong growth in commercial vehicles of 14%, offset by lower production schedules of select customers, primarily in North America and Europe. China revenues were down 3%, representing single-digit growth with local China OEMs and multinational joint ventures, offset by a global EV manufacturer that experienced significant volume reductions in the quarter.\nSegment adjusted operating income was $143 million or 7.1%, up 60 basis points over prior year, with strong execution on footprint optimization to enhance manufacturing efficiency and to align to customer production levels, including site closures in China and ongoing footprint rotation from Eastern Europe to Northern Africa and significant improvement in labor productivity, particularly in North America and Europe. Foreign exchange was a slight positive, primarily due to the Mexican peso.\nTurning to Slide 16. Building on a strong operating performance in the first quarter and visibility to customer schedule through April, we are comfortable providing guidance for the current quarter and expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $4.92 billion to $5.12 billion, down 1% year-over-year at the midpoint. Operating income and adjusted EPS are expected to be $575 million and $1.80 at the midpoint of the range, respectively.\nAs Kevin mentioned, given the strength of our first quarter performance and second quarter outlook I just provided, we are confident that excluding the impact of tariffs, we would be above the midpoint of our previously issued full year guidance range. However, we acknowledge the uncertainty related to global tariff policies and intend to update our full year guidance as we get further visibility.\nFor further context, I'd like to provide a framework. The midpoint of our full year guidance range we provided in February excluded any tariff-related impact and reflected active weighted global vehicle production, down approximately 3% for the year, while the lower end of our range reflected production down approximately 5%, which, based on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook, would imply second half volumes down 7% year-over-year. We hope you find this information useful. With our robust business model and relentless focus on optimizing performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver best-in-class performance, regardless of the environment.\nBefore handing the call back to Kevin, I wanted to highlight our strong cash flow generation and strength of our balance sheet on Slide 17. Our focus on operational improvement and disciplined approach to working capital management resulted in a record first quarter operating cash flow of $273 million and strong ending cash balance of $1.1 billion for the quarter, despite paying down approximately $530 million of debt, including the outstanding balance on our term loan A. We further accelerated our debt paydown schedule, and in April, we retired the remaining balance of approximately $175 million of our pan-European factoring facility. In total, since the start of the year, we have paid down approximately $700 million of debt, putting us almost 3 quarters ahead of our original deleveraging plan.\nWith liquidity of over $3.4 billion and net leverage at 2.2x, our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, while selectively pursuing growth opportunities.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Varun. I'll wrap up on Slide 18 before opening the line for questions. We exceeded expectations in the first quarter, driving strong operating execution despite a dynamic market, with record first quarter earnings and cash flow, and we're well positioned to continue our strong operating performance through the balance of the year.\nAs Varun and I have reviewed, we're confident in our second quarter guidance as well as our initial full year outlook, which excluded the impact of tariffs, and we'll update our full year outlook once we have greater visibility to customer demand for the second half of the year. In the meantime, we hope that the added visibility we've provided to our tariff exposure and the actions we're taking to mitigate the impact as well as the framework we provided to consider different vehicle production scenarios and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flows has been helpful.\nWith our resilient business model and the proactive cost structure actions and supply chain measures we're taking to position the company for continued success, we're confident in our ability to deliver operational efficiencies while executing our long-term strategy. With our solid business foundation, we believe that Aptiv's approach to innovation will drive continued penetration of our electrified, software-defined and connected solutions across industries, further accelerated by the separation of EDS, which will create 2 independent public companies, each with its own unique product portfolio and financial profile, with greater flexibility to pursue their own market opportunities and capital allocation strategies and optimally positioned to address customers' needs, while accelerating value creation for shareholders.\nOperator, let's now open the line for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jane Wu, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\n\nJane Wu\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Corporate Development and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials excludes amortization, restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results as well as our first quarter and full year 2025 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release. During today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chair and CEO; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Varun will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Aptiv ended the year on a solid note with fourth quarter results in line with our expectations demonstrating our ability to execute in today's dynamic market environment. Touching on a few of the highlights. New business bookings reached a fourth quarter record of $10.1 billion, reflecting the strength of our portfolio of industry-leading advanced technologies, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, that's down 1%, the result of strong revenue growth from new program launches across key product lines, offset by continued weakness in production schedules at select OEMs, primarily in Europe and with multinational joint ventures in China.\nQuarterly operating income reached $623 million, reflecting strong operating performance and ongoing cost reduction initiatives which also, along with share repurchases and the restructuring of Aptiv's ownership interest in the Motional joint venture drove earnings per share growth of 25%. Lastly, operating cash flow totaled a record $1.1 billion, allowing us to accelerate our deleveraging which Varun will discuss shortly.\nIn summary, our team is doing an exceptional job addressing the evolving needs of our customers, while also operating efficiently and further optimizing our cost structure. Turning to the next slide to cover our major achievements during 2024. Aptiv continued to capitalize on the safe, green and connected megatrends, reaching numerous technology milestones during the year, including 2 awards for full system Gen 6 ADAS platforms, 1 of which is from an EMEA-based OEM that also includes in-cabin sensing and our full suite of Wind River embedded and Studio developer software.\nMultiple program launches with Mahindra that utilize our integrated cockpit controller, which consolidates multiple ECUs into a single compute platform capable of supporting higher levels of performance and scalability. And the expansion of our portfolio of 48-volt [ connected ] to meet the increasing demand from OEMs. We're also capitalizing on strong commercial traction with the local Chinese OEMs, leading the transition to software-defined vehicles, reflected in 16% revenue growth with the domestic OEMs and our recent FDA zonal controller award from Cherry that includes both Wind River and Aptiv software.\nAnd lastly, Wind River's launch of Elixir Pro, which has generated significant interest from the broader enterprise Linux ecosystem with launch partners, including AWS, Cap Gemini, Intel, SCIC and Super Micro. These notable achievements during 2024 validate the strength of our industry-leading portfolio and have resulted in new business bookings of $31 billion, including record bookings for Signal and Power Solutions, record operating income and earnings per share, reflecting our strong operating performance and optimized cost structure and record operating cash flow, positioning us to continue to invest in the business, while also accelerating the return of a significant amount of capital to shareholders, which will result in more than a 20% reduction in outstanding shares.\nWe continued executing on our long-term strategy while also launching a record number of new vehicle programs and increasing the resiliency of our supply chain. We're extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2024 and the performance of the Aptiv team.\nMoving to Slide 5 to review new business awards. As I mentioned on the previous slide, our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies enabled us to reach just under $31 billion of new business awards during the year. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $4.4 billion, driven by active safety bookings of $2.7 billion, including the 2 Gen 6 ADAS platform awards I mentioned earlier as well as Gen 6 radar awards with a German luxury OEM and 2 large Japanese OEMs.\nSignal and Power Solutions bookings reached $26.4 billion, including $8 billion in the Engineered Components group across the full product portfolio in multiple end markets and a record $18.4 billion in the electrical distribution systems business. And lastly, across all product lines, a record $7 billion of new business in China, of which over $5 billion was with top local Chinese OEMs and a U.S.-based global electric vehicle OEM.\nWith a broad portfolio of advanced technologies that provides OEMs with increased flexibility at a competitive cost, we have clear line of sight to over $31 billion of new business awards in 2025.\nTurning to Slide 6 to review the highlights for our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment which achieved record revenue and earnings in 2024, underscoring the competitiveness of our product portfolio and the strength of our operating capabilities. Revenues increased 2% and driven by double-digit growth in North America with local OEMs in China, partially offset by low single-digit declines in Europe and Asia Pacific.\nActive Safety revenues increased mid-teens. Partially offset by a decline in user experience revenues due to the roll-off of legacy programs. Operating margins were over 12%. And the benefit of the continued rotation of our engineering footprint to India and our ongoing adoption of Wind River's DevSecOps tools, which have improved the productivity of our software developers by over 20%.\nWind River revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by studio operator awards in telco, but full year revenues were down slightly, the result of the continued slowdown in investment in 5G infrastructure in telco, impacting closure rates on commercial opportunities and a longer selling cycle for Studio developer in the automotive and industrial markets.\nIncreased investment in Wind River's commercial and product organization during the year to enhance our existing portfolio of products, including VxWorks, operator and developer and also build new products such as ElixirPro, which we're confident will drive strong revenue growth in 2025.\nIn addition, the advancements in AI is providing Wind River with incremental growth opportunities as customers look to reduce costs by moving AI work flows to the edge. Overall, advanced safety and user experience provides solutions that increase flexibility while lower cost, making us a partner of choice for our customers. This is reflected in our recent awards, including a central computer award for active safety and user experience applications across multiple Geely brands, an award for an integrated cockpit controller from a major global truck manufacturer additional awards with leading Japanese OEMs for a Gen 6 radar solution and an award with Boost Mobile to provide core to edge cloud infrastructure for the world's largest open ran deployment which demonstrates Wind River's leadership position in the telco industry.\nTurning to the Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 7. Revenues declined 3% during the year, with electrical distribution systems impacted by lower vehicle production schedules with select OEMs in North America and Europe and 2 multinational JVs in China and Engineered Components Group benefiting from growth in non-auto markets offset by lower high-voltage revenue. Drive further margin expansion in electrical distribution systems, we're accelerating the rotation of our manufacturing footprint to Central America and North Africa, while also increasing the automation of select manufacturing processes, targeting automation levels of 30% by 2026 and over 50% in 2030, as we've discussed previously. We've also demonstrated strong commercial momentum across all regions as reflected in fourth quarter bookings, including a significant Electrical Architecture award with a major North American OEM for their light and heavy-duty truck platforms.\nOver $1 billion of new business awards with lean local OEMs in China and several customer awards are interconnect solutions in the aerospace and defense, space and industrial markets.\nMoving to Slide 8. I wanted to touch on our recent announcement to separate the Electrical Distribution Systems business from Aptiv, creating 2 optimally positioned independent companies each with its own unique product portfolio and financial profile and with greater flexibility to pursue their own individual market opportunities and capital allocation strategies. By enhancing strategic and operational focus, we're positioning both Aptiv and EDS to more effectively address the evolving needs of our customers and to further capitalize on market opportunities, which we believe will drive even greater success and value creation for both companies.\nWe're targeting the completion of the separation by March 31, 2026, subject to final approval by Aptiv's Board of Directors and customary conditions. In the meantime, we'll continue to keep investors updated as the separation progresses, and we'll host Investor Days for both Aptiv and EDS in the fall of this year.\nMoving to Slide 9 in our outlook for 2025. We remain confident that the trend towards greater levels of electrification, automation, digitalization and connectivity will continue. With our portfolio of advanced technologies, Aptiv is well positioned to address the evolving needs of our customers and to further capitalize on market opportunities across multiple industries. The market remains dynamic, and the recent announcements regarding trade policy has created incremental uncertainty, which could impact supply chain and vehicle production.\nAs a result, as [ Raul ] discuss shortly, we believe it's prudent to include additional conservatism for North American vehicle production in our current outlook for 2025. But to be clear, our outlook has not factored in changes in tax, trade or tariff policy by the new administration. We'll monitor the situation closely, and take actions as necessary while continuing to capitalize on growth opportunities, including the continued growth in electric vehicles and ongoing adoption of advanced ADAS solutions globally and improved customer mix by new vehicle program launches and continued penetration and accelerated growth with the leading local Chinese OEMs, and we'll continue to optimize our cost structure, pursue strategic capital deployment opportunities including further debt paydown, bolt-on M&A and the opportunistic return of cash to shareholders and false execute the EDS separation targeted for the first quarter of 2026.\nI'll now turn the call over to Varun to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nVarun Laroyia\n\nExecutive Vice President & CFO\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Kevin shared a novo view of the quarter, and I'll share further details, including insight into segment performance.\nAdditionally, in connection with the previously announced planned spinoff of our Electrical Distribution Systems business effective first quarter 2025, we are realigning our business into 3 reportable segments. EDS, ECG and ASX. To reflect this change, we are furnishing supplemental recast quarterly financial information for 2024 and 2023.\nStarting with Slide 10. Aptiv delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter despite revenues down 1% as we continue to drive operating performance improvements across the business. Consistent with the third quarter, revenue growth was impacted by lower vehicle production at select customers. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $811 million, and $623 million, respectively, with performance more than offsetting labor economics, which contributed to an increase in operating margin by 50 basis points over the prior year.\nFX and commodities were a $26 million tailwind in the quarter, primarily the favorable impact of the Mexican peso. We delivered quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.75, an increase of 25% from the prior year, which primarily reflects the benefits of share repurchases and the restructuring of the Motional joint venture.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter totaled a record $1.1 billion and capital expenditures were $166 million. Finally, during the quarter, we paid down $1.1 billion of outstanding debt, including the 1.5% euro notes that were due in 2025, as well as $350 million or over half of the term loan A due in 2027.\nMoving to Slide 11. As previously stated, revenue was negatively impacted by lower vehicle production, which was down 4% in the quarter, driven by revenue on electrified vehicle platforms down 20% globally. Net price in commodities were positive in the quarter, partially offset by foreign exchange. Revenue performance was mixed across regions, with North America up 3%, driven by strong active safety growth, Europe was down 8%, impacted by slower growth in electrified vehicle platforms, partially offset by active safety. And China grew 4%, with sales to local OEMs up 25%. And Bringing full year 2024 revenue mix in China to 53% with local OEMs, 34% with multinational joint ventures and the balance with a large global EV manufacturer.\nMoving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Fourth quarter year-over-year revenues were up 2%. The Active Safety product line grew 15% in the quarter driven by North America, which grew over 50% as a result of proliferation across platforms and the smart vehicle compute and software product line grew 13%, in line with expectations. Offset by the user experience product line, down 12% in the quarter, reflecting rolloff of legacy programs as well as lower multinational JV vehicle production in China. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income and margin were $193 million and 14%, respectively, resulting from significant year-over-year improvement in operating performance and our continued focus on cost improvement initiatives. For the full year, revenue grew 2% with strong active safety growth of 16%, offset by user experience down 12%. The Full year operating income and margins were up 58% to $714 million with 440 basis points of margin expansion.\nTurning to Signal and Power on Slide 13. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.5 billion, down 2% due to lower volumes, partially offset by 5% growth in nonauto end markets. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $430 million or 12.1%, impacted by the lower volume flow-through. For the full year, Revenue growth was down 3% as weakness in North America and Europe was partially offset by 16% growth with local China OEMs, while low-voltage and high-voltage revenue on electrified platforms was down 16%. Full year segment adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion or 11.8%, up 20 basis points reflecting improved operating performance as well as net benefit from price and commodities, while the year-over-year FX impact was not significant.\nTurning now to Slide 14 and macro expectations for 2025. As Kevin mentioned, we remain cautious about the impact of geopolitical factors, including uncertainty around tariffs. While our outlook does not reflect the direct impacts of potential trade policy changes, we have included additional conservatism in our expectations for North America production. We are forecasting active weighted global vehicle production to be down 3% for the year, reflecting approximately 92 million units. Regionally, we expect strong full year revenue growth in North America despite production down 5%, driven by content growth with key customers, including the D3, which represents over half our revenue. [indiscernible]\nAs major European OEMs transition from ICE to electrified vehicle platforms, which are expected to grow approximately 20% year-over-year. And China production flat with local finite OEMs continue to win share from multinational joint ventures. Given the dynamics as well as are accelerating traction with local [indiscernible] we are on track to exit the year approaching market parity on China revenue.\nMoving to Slide 15 and our full year 2025, full year outlook. While we expect a lower vehicle production environment, we remain confident that our continuous improvement initiatives will drive strong operating performance and cash flow generation going forward. Given the volatility in production schedules last year, we also want to provide guidance on our expectations for the first quarter.\nFirst quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, down 3% at the midpoint. Operating income and adjusted EPS are expected to be $520 million and $1.50 at the midpoint of the range, respectively. Our full year outlook for revenue is in the range of $19.6 billion to $20.4 billion, up 2% at the midpoint year-over-year, reflecting ASUX up mid-single digit up low single digits and EDS flat. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $3.19 billion, and $2.42 billion at the midpoint, reflecting flow-through on sales growth and performance and cost reduction initiatives offsetting labor headwinds.\nAdjusted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $7 and $7.60, up 17% at the midpoint, with operating cash flow of $2.1 billion, and capital expenditures at approximately 4.5% of revenue.\nOn Slide 16, we provide a bridge of 2025 revenue and operating income guidance as compared to 2024. Starting with revenue, sales growth of over $500 million is expected to be driven by active safety, up high single digits year-over-year and low voltage and high voltage on electrified platforms up low double digits. We expect annual price declines within the historical range of down 1.5% to 2%, offset by commodities and recoveries. And FX is estimated to be a headwind of $200 million.\nTurning to adjusted operating income. We expect margin expansion of 10 basis points at the midpoint of our guide, driven by flow-through on incremental sales, partially offset by net price, commodities and FX, while performance initiatives are expected to offset incremental labor inflation.\nSlide 17 provides further detail on adjusted EPS and Building on our strong performance last year and year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 17% is driven by volume flow-through, partially offset by higher tax expense due to the OECD Pillar 2 implementation and our proactive capital allocation actions, including share repurchases and our reduced equity holdings in Motional.\nBefore handing the call back to Kevin, I would like to touch upon our cash flow outlook. While we generated a record $2.4 billion in operating cash flow in 2024. We expect 2025 to be impacted by a return to growth and a strategic inventory build of semiconductors in anticipation of possible shortages in late 2025, and early 2026, which we will calibrate based on availability and demand forecasts. We will also continue to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation, including investing in the business to drive innovation that will deliver sustainable profitable growth. And while we increased leverage last year to return capital to shareholders, including the $3 billion ASR, we are ahead of our commitment to delever our balance sheet. Building on our debt paydown in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and stronger performance in cash, we have retired an additional $250 million year-to-date. Thereby extinguishing the term loan A in its entirety and bringing our total debt pay down in the last 2 months to $1.4 billion. We also plan to accelerate further debt paydown into the first half of 2025. We will consider utilizing excess cash to explore bolt-on M&A opportunities and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, all within the parameters of investment-grade ratings.\nWith that, I'd now like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Varun. I'll wrap up on Slide 19 before opening the line for questions. As the management team reflects on 2024, we expect the market to remain dynamic and the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate and drive ongoing transformation across industries.\nLooking forward, while our 2025 guidance does not include the impact of future policy changes, including tariffs, we believe that we've taken an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook. We've purpose-built our technology portfolio to deliver flexible, high-performance and cost-effective solutions that address our customers' needs all on a global scale. And at the same time, we remain committed to flawlessly executing and delivering a strong operational performance. enabling us to unlock incremental profitability and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\nIn closing, I'm proud of what the active team accomplished during 2024 and I'm excited about what we'll deliver in the years ahead.\nOperator will now open the line for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jane Wu, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\n\nJane Wu\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Corporate Development and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our second quarter results as well as our 2024 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Looking at the second quarter, we delivered record earnings and EPS, reflecting solid execution across the company as well as lower supply chain disruption costs, completion of the restructuring of the Motional joint venture and lower share count. The strong earnings 180 basis points of operating margin expansion and 26% EPS growth was in spite of significant revenue headwinds from select customers, which Joe will provide more detail on later. These headwinds were partially offset by strong ADAS revenue growth in North America and Europe as well as double-digit revenue growth with the Chinese local OEMs. Our cash flow performance continued to be strong, positioning us to repurchase over $400 million of stock during the quarter.\nBuilding on that momentum, this morning, we announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, which includes an accelerated share repurchase plan. reflecting our view that our stock is undervalued and does not reflect our significant market opportunities. Joe and I will provide more detail on the announcement later in the presentation. And lastly, we released our annual sustainability report, which provides an update on Aptiv's commitment to not only achieving our sustainability goals, but assisting our customers in achieving their goals as well.\nMoving to Slide 4. During the second quarter, we booked $4.3 billion in new business awards, bringing the year-to-date total to over $17 billion, putting us on track to achieve our full year target of $35 billion. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings in the quarter totaled $900 million, driven by continued strong momentum in ADAS as well as awards across Wind River's product portfolio in the A&D, telco, industrial and automotive markets. bringing year-to-date bookings to nearly $3.5 billion. Signal and Power Solutions new business bookings totaled $3.4 billion in the quarter and included an Electrical Architecture award with a leading Chinese local OEM on an export vehicle platform as well as a program extension with a global European-based commercial vehicle OE bringing year-to-date bookings to almost $14 billion. New business bookings in China across both segments continue to track to the changing customer landscape and market share gains made by the local OEMs. We Year-to-date, bookings with the Chinese local OEMs totaled over $1.8 billion, an increase of 27% over last year.\nTurning to our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 5. The segment achieved record revenues and earnings during the quarter, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our operations. We continue to broaden our customer mix by leveraging our industry-leading ADAS portfolio. We booked a new ADAS program with a Chinese local OEM that utilizes the local SoC solution which customers in the China market are increasingly requiring as well as a radar award with a global Japanese OEM, representing the fifth RADAR program we've been awarded by Japanese customer over the last 12 months. bringing total radar bookings with this customer segment to almost $1.1 billion. Revenue increased 2% to over $1.5 billion in the quarter as Aptiv's safety revenues increased mid-teens, partially offset by user experience revenues, which were impacted by significantly lower multinational OEM production in China. Operating income totaled a record $170 million, representing margins of 10.9%.\nAs discussed during our last earnings call, supply chains have stabilized, which has led to a significant reduction in disruption costs. And as I mentioned, our China semiconductor sourcing initiative continues to gain traction with Chinese local OEMs and more global OEMs are requesting that we present them with similar options for both current and future programs. providing incremental savings opportunities for our customers while also reducing our material costs and improving our profitability. Engineering expense also declined during the quarter, almost $20 million versus the same period last year, bringing the ratio of engineering to sales down 20 basis points, a trend that we're confident will continue. This has been the result of several efficiency initiatives, including the adoption of Wind River Studio for software development on new OEM programs, the rotation of software engineering activities to our tech centers in best cost countries and a reduction in advanced development activities to reflect changing market conditions.\nMoving to the next slide for an update on Wind River. As we discussed at our recent Wind River and software teach-ins, the digital transformation that reshape the consumer ecosystem is now driving change across other end markets. The strength of Wind River solutions to support that transformation is evident in our recent commercial awards across multiple end markets, totaling nearly $200 million year-to-date. This includes $90 million of aerospace and defense bookings where the need for certified mixed criticality software is driving demand for solutions such as VX Works and Wind River Helix. In telco, the adoption of vRAN and O-RAN favors our open cloud-native solutions, resulting in $50 million in bookings year-to-date. And in industrial and automotive, the growth in connected software-defined devices, which are increasingly deploying AI at the edge, continues to present opportunities for Wind River's full portfolio. as reflected in over $55 million in bookings year-to-date.\nTo support the development, deployment and operation of these intelligent edge solutions, we're gaining commercial traction with Wind River Studio developer. During the quarter, we announced at 3 of the world's leading software engineering service providers are adopting studio developer. And as I mentioned, Aptiv's own adoption has meaningfully improved our software quality and increase the efficiency of our software development process. Lastly, Wind River just announced, it is the prime sponsor of the Elixir project. in open source, Debian-based enterprise-grade Linux solution for the intelligent edge. AWS, Intel, Capgemini, Super Micro and SAIC have joined Wind River as project supporters and we will share more regarding the commercial opportunities associated with us in coming months.\nTurning to our Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 7. Revenues in the segment declined 3% during the quarter, principally the result of the reduction in production schedules by select customers. significantly impacting our electrical distribution systems business, which had revenues declined high single digits. Engineered Components grew low single digits in the quarter with solid revenue growth for traditional interconnect and specialty products in the automotive market and strong growth in the A&D and space markets. which is partially offset by a slowdown in orders from automotive Tier 1s. As I mentioned previously, Signal and Power Solutions booked approximately $3.4 billion in customer awards. We continue to diversify future revenues with Conquest awards, including multiple engineered component awards for high-speed cable assemblies, high-end low-voltage interconnects and power distribution units with a Korean OEM. A high-voltage charging award with a Japanese OEM in North America, our fourth award to date that meets the North American charging standard.\nAnd lastly, our first grid energy storage award and although relatively small, we believe that this is just the start and that the energy storage systems represent an attractive end market for Signal and Power business. Operating income totaled $436 million, representing margins of 12.4% and reflecting strong operating performance resulting from lower supply chain disruption costs as well as manufacturing and engineering performance. We're aligning our manufacturing capacity in this segment across all regions to the lower OEM vehicle production schedules and continue to work closely with our OEM customers to address the labor situation in Mexico.\nLooking at Signal and Power in more detail. We wanted to provide an update on our Engineered Components product line on Slide 8. Aptiv is a market leader in providing highly engineered, ruggedized and mission-critical interconnect, cable management and fastening solutions for automotive and industrial end markets. These solutions have a low cost relative to the overall bill of materials, but a high cost of failure and our integral to the safe and efficient distribution of power and data. Breaking it down further. Aptiv's Connection Systems business, which will have over $4 billion in revenue this year, is the #2 global provider of automotive and commercial vehicle interconnect solutions. HellermannTyton is the #1 provider of cable management and fastening solutions globally and is now almost a $2 billion business. Half of the revenue is automotive, and the other half of the business serves nonautomotive end markets. Lastly, Winchester Interconnect provides highly specialized advanced interconnects and cable assemblies for A&D, commercial space, and other industrial end markets. Both HellermannTyton and Winchester provide access to growing markets benefiting from the same industry mega trends and customer needs in automotive and they're key to both our growth and diversification strategies, reducing our exposure to light vehicle production while strengthening through cycle resiliency.\nMoving to Slide 9. The global trends that included transition to electric power, edge to cloud connectivity and the path to higher levels of software and automation continue with some regions evolving faster than others. And these macro themes have been the tailwind for the safe, green and connected trends that have shaped the automotive industry over the last decade. And we strongly believe Aptiv remains well positioned to benefit from these trends. While the pace of EV adoption may be slower than recently anticipated, the demand for electrified vehicles that generate lower CO2 emissions continues to grow. Consumer demand for advanced safety solutions that make global regulatory and rating agency standards remain strong and demand for edge to cloud connectivity that enables more intelligent solutions continues to grow. Despite some near-term challenges, our customers remain committed to making vehicles more safe, more green and more connected and require our expertise and assistance to develop optimized solutions that balance the trade-offs between performance and cost. And in cases where customers have or considering delaying their original next-gen technology adoption plans, we're being presented with several incremental near and midterm opportunities to enhance existing solutions. So OEMs can remain competitive in the market by addressing consumer demand for new features and applications that are more efficient, cost-effective and compliant with regulations.\nMoving to Slide 10. As the world continues to become more electrified and software-defined, we're uniquely positioned to enable this transition for our customers and are confident in our ability to meaningfully grow earnings and cash flow and deliver significant value to our shareholders. and strongly believe that Active shares are an attractive investment opportunity. Accordingly, our Board has approved a $5 billion share repurchase authorization including a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase program. The total authorization represents over 25% of our current market cap and is incremental to the almost $9 billion we returned to shareholders since our IPO in 2011. We're very excited about Aptiv's long-term growth prospects and believe that repurchasing our stock is a great investment. And given the strength of our financial performance, we can execute this repurchase program while continuing to invest in our portfolio of advanced technologies. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the second quarter on Slide 11. Aptiv delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, reflecting execution of our performance initiatives as well as our continued focus on costs, resulting in operating margin improvement of 180 basis points over the prior year. Revenue was $5.1 billion, down 2% or 1% below underlying global vehicle production which was down 1% in the quarter. Revenue growth was primarily impacted by lower production volumes at select customers, including a European OEM with a large truck and SUV presence in North America, a global EV-only OEM and 2 multinational OEMs in China that are experiencing significantly lower production volumes. These customers represented the majority of the revenue shortfall in the second quarter and as I will discuss shortly, we are lowering our full year revenue outlook.\nDespite the top line pressure, adjusted EBITDA and operating income were both quarterly records at $788 million and $606 million, respectively. EBITDA margins expanded 220 basis points over prior year as our performance and cost actions helped reduce the decremental impact of lower revenues. FX and commodities were a $17 million headwind in the quarter. Earnings per share in the quarter was $1.58, an increase of 26% from the prior year, including the benefit of higher earnings, completion of the Motional JV transaction, a $0.12 benefit in the quarter as well as the benefit of a lower share count, partially offset by higher taxes. Operating cash flow was strong, totaling $643 million, capital expenditures were $226 million and share repurchases totaled $434 million.\nMoving to Slide 12. Revenue of $5.1 billion was down 2%. As mentioned, revenue was negatively impacted by vehicle production headwinds in select customers primarily impacting our electrical distribution and user experience product lines, including customer schedule reductions in both electrified and internal combustion vehicles. This was partially offset by growth in our Active Safety and Engineered Components product lines. Net price and commodities were positive to the top line, offsetting the negative impact of foreign exchange. Moving to the right. Our regional revenue performance in North America and Europe reflects the previously mentioned customer and product line dynamics. In China, we grew 16% in the quarter with local OEMs and effectively offsetting the negative impact from lower production at the multinational OEMs. As Kevin discussed, we continue to expand our business with the local Chinese OEMs and as we see strong double-digit growth in both new business bookings and revenues with this customer segment.\nMoving to Slide 13. Our ASUX segment achieved record quarterly revenue and earnings as strong growth in active safety more than offset the impact of lower user experience revenues. Active Safety was up 15% in the quarter with continued strength across North America and Europe. User experience, which is impacted by the slowdown in multinational OEMs in China was down 10% in the quarter. Segment adjusted income in the quarter was $170 million or 10.9%, driven by strong flow-through on active safety volumes as well as the ongoing initiatives to improve manufacturing and engineering efficiency.\nTurning to Signal and Power on Slide 14. Revenue in the second quarter was just over $3.5 billion, a decrease of 3% or 2% below vehicle production, reflecting growth in the Engineered Components product line, excluding high voltage of 3%, offset by declines in the electrical distribution product line, primarily driven by the lower volumes at select customers. and high-voltage revenues were down 19% in the quarter. Segment adjusted operating income was $436 million or 12.4%, driven by operating performance initiatives and cost reduction actions. Net pricing commodities were a positive, offsetting the negative impact of foreign exchange.\nMoving to Slide 15 and our updated macro outlook. Based on changes in customer schedules, we now assume global vehicle production will be down 3% in 2024 from our prior outlook of down 1%. Expected production volume is down across all regions, with North America now expected to be down 1%, Europe down 5% and China flat on a year-over-year basis. driven by lower production at multinational OEMs in China. In addition of vehicle production reductions across regions, we are also seeing reductions across powertrains, including both EV and internal combustion platforms. For FX and commodity rates, our outlook assumes copper at $4.25, Mexican peso at $17.40 and the Chinese RMB at $7.15.\nSlide 16 has our full year outlook. As we look out at the balance of the year, we do expect continued pressure on vehicle production, particularly from the select customers we noted. However, we remain confident that the actions we have taken to improve performance and reduce costs will continue to drive strong operating performance. Our outlook includes revenues in the range of $20.1 billion to $20.4 billion, down from the prior midpoint of $21.2 billion, representing adjusted revenue growth of 1%. I would note that we've incorporated both customer schedule reductions as well as an additional judgmental reduction in revenues and our updated outlook. We assume global vehicle production is down 3%, resulting in growth over market of 4%. At the segment level, ASUX growth over market remained strong at 10% and with SPS at 1%. Operating income of $2.4 billion, which is an increase in operating margin to 12% and reflecting continued strong operating performance that partially offsets the decremental impact of the lower revenues.\nWe are also increasing our EPS estimate to $6.30 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.25 from prior guide, resulting from the early completion of the Motional JV transaction as well as lower share count, which offsets the impact from lower earnings. Operating cash is expected to be $2.15 billion, up 13% from the prior year. The outlook also reflects the impact of the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. As Kevin stated, we are announcing a $5 billion share repurchase authorization, which will include an accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, totaling $3 billion that will commence tomorrow. Our confidence in the long-term mega trends, combined with our operating performance and the strength of our balance sheet afford us the opportunity to acquire a significant amount of Aptiv's common stock. The ASR will be funded through a combination of available liquidity and debt. We believe the ASR continues our long-standing practice of balanced capital allocation and our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in the business while accelerating capital return to shareholders. The remaining authorization will be available for future purposes once the ASR is completed.\nMoving to my final slide on 18. Our consistent focus on improving and maintaining Aptiv's strong financial position, has provided us the ability to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our financial policy and balanced track record of capital deployment. Performance improvement initiatives across the business and the elimination of the significant disruption costs experienced over the last few years have returned margins to pre-COVID levels. and the completion of the Motional transaction provides additional funds for capital deployment within Aptiv. Our capital allocation plans, including the acceleration of capital returned to shareholders, fits within our financial policy as we maintain the ability to invest in the business and delever over the coming year. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Joe. I'll make some final remarks on Slide 20 before opening the line up for questions. we executed well in the second quarter despite the revenue headwinds with record earnings and strong cash flow, and we're well positioned to continue our solid operating performance through the remainder of the year. we believe our revised financial outlook is prudent, reflecting the lower OEM production schedules plus an overlay of incremental management conservatism that Joe mentioned and we're confident that our strong operating performance will translate into increased operating margins as reflected in our updated outlook. As the automotive industry navigates the near-term headwinds, we remain confident that the trends towards greater levels of electrification, connectivity and digitization will continue.\nAnd Aptiv's portfolio is well positioned to help our customers both transition to and benefit from a more electrified, connected and software-defined world, which we're confident will result in strong earnings and cash flow growth that will translate into significant value creation for our shareholders. Our conviction around the medium- to long-term trend and our strong operating performance has positioned us to take advantage of the market dislocation in our stock price, and allows us to increase our capital return to shareholders. Our management team remains focused on flawless execution and creating shareholder value, and we will continue to drive the business forward. focused on developing our portfolio of advanced technologies, strong operating execution, returning cash to shareholders and maximizing the value of our portfolio of businesses. Operator, let's now open the line up for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jane Wu, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\n\nJane Wu\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Corporate Development and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Jess. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our first quarter results as well as our 2024 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, Vice Chairman of Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Operationally, we had a strong start to the year, demonstrating our ability to execute despite some headwinds.\nTouching on a few highlights. New business bookings reached almost $13 billion, reflecting the continued demand for our industry-leading product portfolio. First quarter revenue was just under $5 billion, representing adjusted year-over-year growth of 2%, impacted by continued slowing of electric vehicle production in North America and Europe production and increased labor inflation and earnings per share increased 27% to $1.16.\nLastly, we repurchased $600 million of stock during the quarter...\nHello. Apologies we seem to have had a technical difficulty. So if it's okay, I'll start from the beginning.\nSo again, thanks, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Operationally, we had a strong start to the year, demonstrating our ability to execute despite some headwinds.\nStarting on a few highlights. New business bookings reached almost $13 billion, reflecting the continued demand for our industry-leading product portfolio. First quarter revenue was just under $5 billion, representing adjusted year-over-year growth of 2%, impacted by continued slowing of electrical vehicle production in both North America and Europe. EBITDA and operating income totaled $720 million and $544 million, respectively, representing more than 20% growth and roughly 200 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting benefits from productivity initiatives and cost actions, which offset lower vehicle production and increased labor inflation. And earnings per share increased 27% to $1.16.\nLastly, we repurchased $600 million of stock during the quarter, bringing the total amount of shares repurchased to $900 million over the last 2 quarters. In summary, the team did an exceptional job delivering solutions to our customers, while at the same time, increasing operating efficiencies and reducing our cost structure.\nTurning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by our strong first quarter execution, we believe that it's prudent to update our 2024 outlook to reflect the continued weakness in electric vehicle production, including significant customer schedule reductions over the past few weeks and the current negative impact of foreign exchange rates. As a result, we're lowering our full year 2024 revenue guidance by $450 million, principally reflecting a reduction in our outlook for high-voltage revenue growth.\nWhile we continue to believe that all regions are on the path to full electrification, some will move faster than others, so we consider it prudent to reduce our near-term revenue expectations.\nAs the industry navigates the current headwinds, we're maintaining our high standard of flawless execution, while continuing to reduce our cost structure and strengthen our sustainable business model. We're supporting our customers on a record number of new program launches, almost 2,300 in 2024, including over 750 program launches in the first quarter, the cadence of which gives us confidence in the acceleration of our second half revenue growth.\nWe've also proactively executed initiatives that have lowered our cost structure. In early '23, we launched several initiatives to improve engineering efficiency in both our ASUX and SPS segments. And in late 2023, we executed additional cost actions across all overhead and operating functions, targeting more than a 10% reduction in salary payroll. And in response to the recent softness of electric vehicle production schedules, we kicked off incremental cost actions that will generate an additional $50 million of cost savings through the balance of this year.\nThe net result of these puts and takes is a $50 million reduction in our full year outlook for operating income to $2.5 billion, above the bottom end of our prior guidance range, representing 11.8% operating margin and just under 80% growth in operating income.\nI'm pleased to announce that we've reached a formal agreement with the Hyundai Motor Group regarding our Motional joint venture, which positions Motional for ongoing success while addressing the needs of both joint venture partners. Joe will go into more detail later in the presentation.\nLastly, we continue to believe that our stock is undervalued and presents an attractive opportunity to return capital to shareholders. As such, we're doubling our share repurchase target from $750 million to $1.5 billion during 2024.\nIn summary, our conviction regarding the strength of our competitive position and the long-term value of our business is as high as ever, and we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 5. As mentioned, bookings reached nearly $13 billion in the quarter. Advanced safety and user experience bookings totaled $2.5 billion, driven by active safety bookings of $1.9 billion, including our first full system Gen 6 ADAS award, including in-cabin sensing and the full suite of Wind River Embedded and Studio developer software with an emerging EV player, bringing the cumulative active safety and user experience segment awards to $33 billion since the first quarter of 2021.\nSignal and Power Solutions new business bookings reached a record of over $10.3 billion, reflecting electrical distribution systems bookings totaling a record $7 billion including an award from a leading global Japanese OEM for both plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles for the North American market and connection systems booked totaling $2.5 billion including an award from a leading electric vehicle OEM for high-speed cable assemblies on a global electric vehicle platform, bringing cumulative S and PS segment bookings to $70 billion since the first quarter of 2021.\nIn China, across both segments, we were awarded [ $2 billion ] in new business awards with both local and multinational OEMs including a vehicle architecture work from a leading local Chinese OEM for a low-cost battery electric vehicle, putting us on track to exceed our full year 2023 bookings of just under $6 billion.\nWith our industry-leading portfolio, our global scale and our ability to execute highly complex programs, we remain confident in achieving our target of $35 billion of business awards during 2024.\nTurning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's first quarter highlights. The segment reported 5% growth driven by 24% growth in active safety, which is on track for 20% full year revenue growth, more than offsetting the challenging comparables for user experience in Wind River in the quarter. Solid revenue growth was coupled with ongoing productivity improvements, including the continued maturation of our global product organization, driving higher levels of platform usage and software reuse.\nThe consolidation of engineering centers and the continued rotation of engineering resources to our tech center in Bangalore, India, which is driving our percentage located in best cost countries to over 75%. The ongoing adoption of Wind River Studio, which is resulting in a roughly 40% improvement in workflow performance in the software building and scanning processes. And lastly, the continued progress we've made validating local Chinese semiconductor suppliers to meet the increasing demand from local Chinese OEMs for localized sources of supply and provide global OEMs with increased supply chain flexibility and resiliency at significantly lower costs.\nIn terms of commercial highlights in the quarter, in addition to the Gen 6 ADAS award I mentioned earlier, we're awarded a radar program by a global Japanese OEM for applications across multiple vehicle platforms in the North American, European and Asia Pacific markets. And Wind River Studio developer was selected by a major local Chinese OEM to help increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with the development, deployment, operations and servicing of the telecom edge systems.\nMoving to Slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, an emerging electric vehicle OEM has selected the Aptiv Gen 6 ADAS platform to enable turnkey ADAS across a wide range of platforms and models with the start of production in 2026. This is our first full system productized Gen 6 ADAS platform award, building on Aptiv's proven hands-free highway full system solutions, which are already in production. This open modular and scalable ADAS platform will enable advanced hands-free urban and highway vehicle automation -- safety and region-specific features, including fully integrated sensors, tightly coupled with Aptiv's edge to cloud compute framework.\nA containerized feature stack enabled by Aptiv's AI/ML enhanced solutions, including radar machine learning and ML-based vehicle behavior. And Wind River's extensive offerings such as Wind River Edge with VxWorks and Wind River Studio develop, deploy and operate the software over the life of the program. This award is a testament to our ability to deliver a full system, productized solution to our customers while validating the value of our Gen 6 ADAS platform, which includes flexibility across key layers of the staff to meet our customers' needs, scalability of hardware and software components from entry-level compliance up to Level 3 and industry lead performance at a very competitive cost.\nTurning to Signal and Power Solutions. First, for highlights on Slide 8. We continue to benefit from our industry-leading portfolio, global scale and experience designing and developing optimized vehicle architecture solutions across the entire range of powertrain platforms from the combustion engine to battery electric vehicles. First quarter revenues increased 1%, driven by strong growth in China, partly offset by a decline in high voltage revenues, the result of the softening production schedule for electric vehicle platforms in both North America and Europe that I mentioned earlier.\nNew business bookings during the quarter totaled over $10 billion. We continue to gain traction with top OEMs in China. During the quarter, electrical architecture bookings with China local OEMs reached more than $1 billion, including major awards across each of the five top local OEMs. And we received our first high-voltage integrated Power Electronics award for a DC-to-DC converters from a global EV manufacturer for its next-gen vehicle platforms.\nAs discussed previously, our Signal and Power Solutions segment continues to be impacted by increased labor inflation. To mitigate the impact, the operating team has initiated several actions including the further consolidation of our manufacturing footprint, while rotating more of our footprint to Central America and North Africa and modifying vehicle architecture design to enable the increased automation of select manufacturing processes with a target to increase automation of 30% of standard labor hours by 2026 and over 50% by 2030.\nMoving to Slide 9, and our OEM partners adapt to the shifting pace of construction vehicle demand and emission requirements. Aptiv is positioned to deliver high-performance, cost-effective solutions that span the powertrain spectrum and adapt our capacity to align with the needs of our customers.\nStarting on the left of the slide. As we've discussed previously, we're benefiting from significant and increasing addressable content per vehicle from approximately 800 in electrical architecture content for an internal combustion engine platform to approximately 2,300 for a full battery electric vehicle. In many cases, this incremental content represents an opportunity to apply existing capabilities from a larger addressable market.\nAlthough both penetration rates for hybrids and value electric vehicles may fluctuate in the near term, we firmly believe that the long-term macro tailwind remains attractive as the industry continues down path to full electrification. That said, we've taken a more conservative approach to the pace of electrification. And while we will continue to be more conservative than the broader market sentiment, our outlook still represents a significant market opportunity with meaningful future upside.\nFinally, on the right side of the slide, the strength of our current portfolio across regions, powertrains and platforms significantly insulates the business from any single industry headwind. To illustrate this point, if we were to assume that growth of all electrified vehicle platforms on which we have content was reduced to zero in 2024, including low-voltage solutions on battery electric vehicles, with no substitution from ICE vehicle platforms, our overall growth rate would decline by 1 to 2 points. As a result, we believe that we're uniquely positioned to deliver innovative solutions to our customers and value to our shareholders across all powertrain platforms.\nMoving to Slide 10. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to touch on two recent customer events. In late February, the Wind River and Aptiv teams exhibited at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, giving us the opportunity to collaborate with a wide range of telco customers and partners. The team showcased our ability to support operations at scale for 5G V-RAN and O-RAN deployments while highlighting solutions being leveraged by our customers to improve performance and reliability, reduce costs and unlock new business models.\nAmong the many years of interest to our telco customers was our unique ability to support the convergence of telco infrastructure with a software-defined vehicle, enabling the deployment and update of new services much faster and much more efficiently.\nLast week, we took the opportunity to further strengthen our strategic partnerships in China during the 2024 Baking Auto Show. Led by our local China management team, we engaged with a wide range of customers to discuss key technology trends, consumer expectations and performance and cost requirements that are unique to the China market. Local OEMs are demanding full system solutions, spanning both hardware and software, while consumer interest is accelerating for higher levels of ADAS and enhanced user experience.\nAptiv is perfectly positioned in this market to deliver solutions with increased flexibility, higher performance and faster speed to market, all at a much lower cost.\nWhile we have active engagements with customers across all regions and end markets, it's important to note that all are essentially asking for the same thing: The right hardware, the right software and the right engineering tool chain to support software-defined functionality for mission-critical applications. And as a result, our unique edge-to-cloud portfolio business opted to capitalize not only on the automotive industry's transition to software-defined vehicles, but also on the digital transformation and convergence of multiple industries as intelligence increasingly moves to the edge. By leveraging these proven solutions across industries, Aptiv is positioned for sustained long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the first quarter on Slide 11. Aptiv delivered strong financial results in the quarter, reflecting robust execution across both segments and continued progress on our cost savings and margin improvement actions, resulting in operating margin improvement of 200 basis points over the prior year. Revenues were $4.9 billion, up 2% or 3% above underlying global vehicle production, which was down 1% in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the continued slowing of battery electrical platforms in the quarter, particularly in North America and Europe, where we saw our high-voltage revenue down 2% and 6%, respectively. Revenues on ICE platforms and high-voltage solutions on hybrids were up 2% and 26%, respectively.\nAs I will discuss shortly, given the continued weakness in electric vehicle production, including significant customer schedule reductions over the past few weeks, we are revising downward our 2024 outlook for the year. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $720 million and $544 million, respectively. Operating income margin expanded 200 basis points versus prior year, in part driven by cost reduction and recovery programs put in place in 2023, as well as continued achievement of our operating performance initiatives, including the continued rotation of our engineering footprint to best cost locations. The year-over-year FX and commodity impacts were negligible.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were $1.16 and increased 27% from the prior year, including year-over-year earnings growth of 20%, partially offset by higher tax expense, and share repurchases completed in 2023 in the first quarter of 2024 added approximately $0.03 to EPS in the quarter. Operating cash flow was strong, totaling $244 million. Capital expenditures were $265 million, and share repurchases totaled $600 million.\nLooking at first quarter revenues on Slide 12. As noted, revenue of $4.9 billion was up 2%. Revenue growth was driven by strong active safety growth as well as growth in commercial vehicle and engineered components, partially offset by lower high-voltage revenue. Net price and commodities were positive to the top line, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nMoving to the right. Revenues outgrew vehicle production in all regions. North American revenues were up 2% or 1% above market, driven by increases in active safety and engineered components, partially offset by lower high voltage. In Europe, revenues were down 1% year-over-year or 2 points above vehicle production with lower EV production in the region, partially offset by double-digit growth in active safety. And in China, revenues grew 5 points over market driven by growth with several key local OEMs.\nMoving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Revenue growth was 5% or 6% above global vehicle production. Active safety was up 24% in the quarter, benefiting from new program launches as well as continued strong demand across all regions. User experience was down 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the roll-off of the legacy program in North America and lower multinational JV volumes in China as discussed during our year-end earnings call.\nWind River revenue decreased 16% in the quarter due to a strong year-over-year comparison. As we have discussed, Wind River revenues are lumpy on quarterly basis. For the full year, we expect mid-teens revenue growth at Wind River.\nSegment adjusted operating income in the quarter was $155 million, up significantly over prior year driven by cost reductions taken in the second half of 2023 as well as ongoing performance initiatives, including continued rotation of our footprint. Operating income margin in the quarter was 10.8%.\nTurning to Signal and Power on Slide 14. Revenue in the first quarter was approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of 1% or 2% above vehicle production driven by growth in engineered components of 3%. Declines in high-voltage revenue on BEVs were partially offset by growth in hybrids, which make up approximately 25% of our high-voltage product line revenues. And China revenues were up 11% as we saw [ SPS ] growth of approximately 30% with local OEMs, while we saw growth of 2% with foreign OEMs.\nSegment adjusted operating income was $389 million or 11.2%, up 40 basis points over prior year as our cost savings and operating performance initiatives significantly reduced the impact of higher labor costs and price and commodities were positive. And on a year-over-year basis, the OI impact of foreign exchange was minimal.\nMoving to Slide 15 and our updated macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned, over the past several years -- over the past several weeks, we have seen both legacy OEMs as well as global EV OEMs, lower production schedules primarily in North America and Europe. These reductions are partially offset by select increase in ICE platforms, particularly in North America. As a result, we estimate global vehicle production to be down 1% for the year from a prior forecast of flat.\nOur outlook for revenue growth is now 5% for the year versus our prior outlook of 7%, reflecting growth over market of 6%. As for our key FX and commodity rates for the remainder of the year, we are now assuming copper at $4.35, Mexican peso at MXN 17 to the dollar and the Chinese RMB at 7 15.\nSlide 16 has our updated full year outlook. As discussed, our Q1 operating results were substantially in line with our expectations, including the benefit of our cost savings and performance actions. However, as we look at the balance of the year, we see several likely and persistent headwinds that have caused us to revise and derisk our full year outlook. The revised outlook includes revenues of $21.15 billion, down from the prior midpoint of $21.6 billion, running adjusted revenue growth of 5%. The lower revenues resulted from the previously mentioned customer schedule reductions as well as an additional reduction to our H2 revenue growth based on current market conditions.\nAs a result, first half revenue growth has been lower to 2% from our prior outlook of 4% and second half growth is now 8%, down from over 9% on income of $2.5 billion or 11.8% of revenues, down $50 million from the prior midpoint. We are increasing our EPS estimate to $6.05 a share at the midpoint as the negative impact of the reduction in earnings is more than offset by the benefit of our share repurchase activity as well as the benefit of previously mentioned motional transactions, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We have increased our outlook for operating cash flow, primarily reflecting improved working capital. And we are now targeting share repurchases of $1.5 billion in 2024, up from our prior guidance of $750 million.\nMoving to the next slide, we lay out the more significant changes to our outlook. With respect to revenue, global vehicle production decreasing from a previous outlook of flat to now down 1%, reduction of our full year high-voltage revenue growth from 20% to 5%, the decrease in high voltage partially offset by increases in ICE production schedules, primarily in North America as well as increases in net price and commodities, reflecting higher copper prices that offset the foreign exchange impact on revenues. The decrease in operating income is driven by the flow-through of lower revenues as well as the negative impact foreign exchange, primarily the peso and RMB.\nAs it relates to the Mexican peso, although many forecasts expect the peso to weaken over the course of the year, the peso has remained stronger than our initial expectations. Accordingly, we have updated our guidance to reflect an exchange rate of MXN 17 to the dollar. This is more in line with our spot level and also represents the level at which we have hedged approximately 90% of our 2024 peso exposure. And finally, despite the macro headwinds, we fully expect the benefits of the cost savings and performance actions we delivered in the first quarter to continue, partially mitigating the volume and foreign exchange impact.\nTurning to the next slide. We thought it would be helpful to walk our expected first half versus second half revenues in 2024. Second half revenue is expected to increase approximately $800 million. Increases in both segments are driven by new program launches with key customers in all regions. ASUX half-over-half revenue is expected to increase approximately $200 million with over half of the increase coming from the launch of one of our largest active safety programs across additional platforms in North America and Europe for a global OEM. These additional platforms are internal combustion vehicles and represent several of the OEMs best-selling platforms. Approximately 40% of the launch volume is with local Chinese OEMs, including several launches that have already commenced.\nThe increase in Signal and Power of $500 million includes a launch totaling over $100 million in a large North American internal combustion SUV platform, an additional $100 million across two OEMs for new internal combustion truck launches in North America and Chinese market launches and volume growth for both local and foreign OEMs of over $100 million. The increase in sales will deliver margins higher in the second half with volume flow-through of approximately 30%, partially offset by incremental FX headwind of approximately $35 million due primarily to the peso.\nMoving to the next slide. As Kevin noted, we are excited to announce that we have reached a definitive agreement with Hyundai that provides for the future success of Motional while meeting the needs of the joint venture partners. As part of the agreement, Hyundai will provide Motional additional funding of $475 million. Hyundai will acquire 11% of Motional's common equity held by Aptiv for $448 million, and Aptiv will convert approximately 21% of our common equity interest to a preferred stockholding. Hyundai's funding to Motional will occur in the second quarter and we expect the acquisition of Aptiv shares, which is subject to customary regulatory review to close by the third quarter. The preferred stock conversion will tie with the sale of our common equity to Hyundai.\nOur updated guidance includes approximately $0.30 of additional EPS, reflecting the benefit of the lower Motional common equity holdings beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. On a full year pro forma basis, the lower dilution for Motional will result in [ increase ] EPS of approximately $0.90 per share beginning in 2025.\nBefore handing the call back to Kevin, I'd like to walk through our updated earnings per share expectations in more detail. Building off a strong performance in the first quarter, the year-over-year EPS growth of 24% is driven by higher earnings of $1.32 as well as the benefit of share repurchases in 2024 and the improvement resulting from the transaction with Hyundai to reduce Aptiv's common equity holdings in Motional, more than offsetting the increase in Aptiv's tax rate, which was included in our original guidance.\nIn summary, despite the lower vehicle production levels and slowdown in high voltage, we are confident that the measures taken to improve first quarter operating income and cash flow are sustainable for the balance of the year. The earnings and cash flow growth, combined with the proceeds from the Motional transaction, provide us the opportunity to continue our long track record of balanced capital deployment, including the return of capital to our shareholders.\nWhen combined with the 2023 share repurchases, our outlook for 2024 results in almost $2 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the past 2 years, increasing total capital returned to over $9 billion since our IPO.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 21 before opening the line up for questions. Overall, our strategy remains unchanged, while the industry navigates the near-term headwinds. We'll continue to provide flexible, high-performance, [ cost-defensive ] solutions to our customers that enable the transition to the electrified software-defined vehicle. We remain focused on thought execution and operational excellence, which enables us to delight our customers while optimizing our cost structure to expand margins and deliver value to our shareholders. We executed well in the first quarter and are laser focus on continuing to execute, which will position us well for the remainder of the year.\nOperator, let's now open the line for questions."

Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Aptiv ended the year on a solid note with fourth quarter results broadly in line with our expectations, demonstrating our ability to execute in a less predictable market. Touching on a few highlights. New business bookings reached $7.7 billion, result of continued demand for our portfolio of industry-leading advanced technologies. Revenue was $4.9 billion with growth over market impacted by the UAW strike and customer mix, which Joe will go through in more detail later. Operating income totaled $600 million, reflecting a 90 basis point margin increase, the strong flow-through on volumes and operating performance more than offset headwinds from FX, commodities in the UAW strike. We repurchased $300 million of stock during the quarter, given our share price and cash position.\nIn summary, our team is doing an exceptional job executing in a fast-changing environment, identifying opportunities to provide solutions to our customers while at the same time working to mitigate headwinds from ongoing cost pressures.\nTurning to Slide 4. We delivered on our commitments and achieved record results in 2023 despite having to navigate through unexpected developments. New business bookings were a record $34 billion, reflecting continued strong demand for our products. As vehicles become higher contented and more software defined, customers are increasingly seeing the value of Aptiv as an important technology partner, particularly across our smart vehicle architecture, active safety and high-voltage electrification portfolio, where we lead the industry in delivering high performance, flexible and cost-effective solutions. Aptiv is also positioned to benefit from the transition to the software-defined future across several other industries, with opportunities accelerating in the telecom, aerospace and defense and industrial markets. Revenue increased 12% to over $20 billion in 2023, a new record level, principally driven by our high-growth active safety and high-voltage product lines.\nStrong top line growth contributed to a record $2.1 billion of operating income. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 10.6% as strong volume flow-through and operating performance more than offset the headwinds from FX commodities and the UAW strike. Lastly, we generated record operating cash flow of $1.9 billion for the year, providing flexibility on capital deployment, allowing us to proactively repurchase shares and pay down debt.\nMoving to Slide 5. As I already mentioned, bookings reached $34 billion, our third consecutive year of record new business awards and includes 9 different customers who each awarded Aptiv over $1 billion in new business. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled a record $12 billion driven by active safety bookings of $3.4 billion, representing a combination of next-gen hardware and perception software building blocks as well as full system turnkey solutions, the strength of which is reflected in over $11 billion of cumulative bookings over the last 3 years and $5.2 billion of customer awards for our Smart Vehicle Architecture solutions with 3 different OEMs, bringing cumulative awards since the launch of our SCA products to over $10 billion with 8 different OEMs.\nSignal Power Solutions' new business bookings reached a record of over $22 billion in part due to a record $6.2 billion in high-voltage electrification bookings up roughly $2 billion over 2022, representing awards from both traditional and new mobility providers bringing cumulative high-voltage customer awards to roughly $14 billion since 2021. Our industry-leading portfolio, combined with our global reach and ability to execute highly complex programs perfectly positions Aptiv to win new business and gives us a clear line of sight to $35 billion of business awards in 2024.\nTurning to Slide 6, [ review ] our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's full year highlights. We achieved significant commercial success across all of our key product lines, further solidifying our position as a partner of choice with our OEM customers. Building on its leading market position, Wind River continues to experience solid commercial traction across a variety of end markets. In the fourth quarter, one of Canada's largest communication service providers selected Wind River Studio for their full [ on ] deployment in North America. [ Omron ], a leader in health care systems and industrial automation also chose Wind River Studio for their industrial edge platform development. And within automotive, Hyundai Mobis expanded their existing relationship with Wind River by selecting Wind River Studio to help reduce development time and costs from product design to system validation and mass production testing.\nDemand for Aptiv full system solutions across active safety, user experience and smart vehicle architecture also remains strong with major bookings across all geographic regions, including with Japanese OEMs and emerging Chinese local players, bringing a growing pipeline of additional opportunities. To best support our customers while further optimizing our cost structure, we implemented several initiatives across our engineering and supply chain functions to accelerate and streamline our product development process, our ASUX engineers have incorporated [indiscernible] DevSecOps tool chain into their programs. We've also centralized our engineering activities in India to a new and larger technology center in Bangalore where Aptiv and Wind River teams can better collaborate on our software product platforms, allowing us to double our engineering capacity in the country, thereby enabling the cost-effective rotation of our engineering footprint.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, we're back to fully map our global supply chain into a digital twin by year-end. During 2023, we fully mapped our semi providers increasing our visibility and improving our ability to proactively mitigate potential sources. Lastly, we've closely partnered with roughly a dozen lining semiconductor suppliers for both China and non-China applications that are positioning us to meet increasing demand from our Chinese customers with local sources of supply and increasing the resiliency and flexibility of our supply chain for our global OEM customers.\nTurning to Signal and Power Solutions full year highlights on Slide 7. From a commercial perspective, we've continued to benefit from our industry-leading portfolio and global scale which uniquely positions us to deliver optimized vehicle architecture solutions for both the emerging unique players and leading global OEMs. During 2023, we were awarded significant vehicle architecture programs by a global EV manufacturer including optimized electrical distribution and 48-volt connection systems. In China, while we remain highly selective in our customer and platform choices, we're actively driving increased penetration of a select group of local OEMs. In 2023, bookings with China Local EMs reached $3 million, representing approximately 60% of the total SPS bookings in the region.\nIntercable Automotive had record new business awards and added 4 new global customers with their industry-leading bus fire technology, which enables more efficient for distribution and optimized battery pack design. We've also seen an increase in customer demand for our solutions that reduce complexity, weight and cost, including our integrated power electronics solutions, which help integrate the onboard charger, battery distribution unit and DC to DC converter. From an operational perspective, we've also implemented several initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency. Within our electrical distribution business, we're launching our first highly automated production line, covering all aspects of system assembly. With this new technology, we expect to increase current automation levels to approximately 30% by 2026 putting us on a path to over 50% automation by 2030 which will improve efficiency and product quality while also reducing labor dependency and the associated exposure to inflationary pressures.\nAt the same time, we've been building a more resilient and sustainable business by supporting the trend towards local production and minimizing cross-border flows of product. We continue to pursue manufacturing footprint rotations in multiple regions and have successfully established production capabilities for Intercable automotive in North America to serve in region customers.\nTurning to Slide 8. At this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, we showcased our industry-leading portfolio of products through a full range of functional, fully integrated solutions both in our tech theater as well as on the roads with drivable demo vehicles. This is best represented by our software-defined vehicle demonstrator, which showcased advanced ADAS and user experience applications embedded on Wind River's cloud-native software platform and running on Aptiv smart vehicle architecture hardware. With our first time driving a vehicle, this was our first time driving a vehicle on public roads, supported by SCA further reinforcing our leadership in next-generation architectures.\nWe demonstrated critical elements of our Gen 6 ADAS platform, including our urban point-to-point [ Hans ] driving application as well as in cabin monitoring. We also showcased our high-voltage capabilities with a custom-built 800-volt electric vehicle. This vehicle included optimized high-voltage cabling and bus bars, connection systems and integrated power electronics. We also introduced Aptiv's containerized battery management system running on our central vehicle controller, both of which were supported by Wind River's VxWorks operating system while telemetric data was visualized through Wind River Studio.\nFinally, all of these solutions are more were available for deep dives in our technology theater. When taken together the solutions on display represented our full system portfolio by showcasing capabilities from sensor to cloud. In total, we had over 1,000 stakeholders visit our pavilion ranging across customers, vendors and the industry partners. And as a follow-up to CES, we scheduled a wide range of customer engagements including the Mobile World Congress in late February and customer-focused tech shows during the balance of this year. Our industry-leading product portfolio underscores our position as the partner of choice to develop and deliver next-generation solutions.\nMoving to Slide 9. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to provide some context on our outlook for 2024. As our industries continue to evolve, we're experiencing growing demand for our full system capabilities, spanning across hardware and edge to cloud software solutions. This increasing level of strategic engagement has turned into 3 straight years of record new business bookings and in turn, will continue to drive strong revenue growth and implied growth above market. Joe will walk through our outlook for revenue growth in more detail, but we now expect our growth over market to be in the 6- to 8-point range, reflecting the changing pace of EV adoption and customer mix.\nAs I highlighted earlier, we have proactively taken actions to reduce our cost structure to adapt to the changing market environment and to help offset ongoing inflationary pressures. We remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach, which will include further strengthening our competitive position with investments in advanced technology and capabilities that drive operational excellence. To that end, while our emotional joint venture continues to make progress on their technology road map, we've decided to no longer allocate capital promotional and are pursuing alternatives to further reduce our ownership interest.\nLastly, while we will continue to prioritize organic investments and strategic M&A opportunities, that drive profitable growth, our stock price presents an attractive opportunity to return capital to our shareholders, and we're targeting up to an additional $750 million in share repurchases during 2024. The last few years have presented the industry with unprecedented macro challenges, including COVID and supply chain disruptions. During this period, the management team has remained leisure focused on execution, enhancing our competitive position and increasing the resiliency of our business model, which is reflected in our 2023 financial results and our outlook for 2024, and our conviction in the long-term value of our business is higher than ever, and we remain committed to delivering that value to our shareholders.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the quarter on Slide 10. Revenues were $4.9 billion, in line with our expectations, including the impact of the UAW strike in October. Adjusted growth in the quarter was 2% over the prior year, representing negative growth over market of 5% in the quarter. As Kevin noted, and I will discuss in more detail, the growth over market primarily resulted from the impact of the UAW strike and North American OEM production mix as well as customer mix in China and slower high-voltage growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA and operating income of $772 million and $600 million, respectively, in line with our expectations. Operating income margins expanded 90 basis points versus prior year reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes, the benefit of customer recoveries of direct material increases and strong operating performance, including the benefit of cost-saving actions taken in the second half of 2023, offsetting the impact of the strike, which totaled approximately $50 million in the quarter. And foreign exchange was a 20 basis point headwind in the quarter. EPS was $1.40, an increase of 10% driven by higher operating income, partially offset by interest and tax expense. Operating cash flow totaled $624 million and capital expenditures were approximately $200 million for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, bringing full year repurchases to approximately $400 million.\nLooking at revenue in more detail on Slide 11. As noted, revenue in the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, reflecting sales growth of $188 million, a favorable $62 million contribution from net price downs and commodities, and foreign exchange tailwinds of approximately $29 million. From a regional perspective, North American revenues were down 7% or 11% below market driven in part by the UAW strike impact, which totaled $100 million in October. In addition, as we caution during the fourth quarter, foreign manufacturers, primarily the Japanese OEMs with whom we do not have significant content, experienced very strong year-over-year reduction growth in the quarter, further impacting the relative production mix in the North American market.\nIn Europe, adjusted growth was 6%, in line with vehicle production driven by active safety growth of 18%, partially offset by slower high-voltage growth in the region. And in China, revenues were up 12%, driven by SPS growth with local OEMs. China growth over market was 8 points low vehicle production primarily impacted by lower production of multinational joint venture customers as well as slower high-voltage growth of 4% in the quarter. As I will discuss in more detail shortly, we do expect growth over market to increase in 2024 from the second half 2023 levels.\nMoving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Revenue growth was flat in the quarter. Active safety growth was 11% despite the UAW strike, which primarily impacted the active safety product line in North America. User experience was down $0.16 in the quarter, driven in large part by the previously noted China customer mix shift impacting our user experience volumes with multinational joint venture OEMs in China. For the full year, adjusted revenue growth was 17%, with strong active safety growth of 29% and user experience growth of 4%. Segment adjusted operating in the quarter was $141 million up 83% over prior year despite the negative strike impact of $10 million in the quarter.\nOperating income margins expanded 440 basis points to 10.4%, as performance and cost savings initiatives offset higher labor costs. Full year operating income and margins were in line with our original expectations as margins improved by almost 40 basis points inclusive of the full year strike impact of $15 million. As we have previously discussed, given the nature of the ASUX business and the timing of certain customer reimbursements and engineering credits, the quarterly profitability of the business is cyclical and weighted to the fourth quarter. We would expect this trend to continue in 2024.\nTurning to Signal and Power on Slide 13. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.6 billion, an increase of 3% or 4% below vehicle production. As anticipated, overall SPS growth over market was impacted in North America by the UAW strike and OEM mix, representing approximately 5 points of growth in the quarter. [ Flurohigh-voltage ] growth, which primarily impacted the European region was lower by 2 points. For the full year, adjusted revenue growth was 11% despite the impact of the strike. High-voltage growth was approximately 20% for the year, and segment growth in China was 13%. Segment adjusted operating income was $459 million in the quarter, up 3% from prior year despite a $40 million or 90 basis point strike impact.\nOperating performance was strong, including the benefit of lower supply chain is running costs, offsetting the impact of higher labor and other costs. Customer recoveries offset the impact of material inflation and commodities in the quarter, and foreign exchange continue to present a headwind equal to 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Full year operating margins were up 50 basis points despite the significant headwinds related to foreign exchange and the strike.\nTurning now to Slide 14 and 2024 macro expectations. We are forecasting global vehicle production to be flat for the year, reflecting approximately 93 million units. Regionally, we expect North America to be up approximately 1% at 16.5 million units. Europe down 2% or approximately 18 million units and China flat at approximately 30 million units. While we remain cautious about the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, we do believe that supply chain constraints have improved significantly. And based on what we see today should not have a significant impact on overall customer production levels. Our macro assumptions also assume copper at $4, [indiscernible] $18. 25, the euro at $1.10 and the RMB at $7.\nMoving to Slide 15 and our 2024 full year outlook. We expect revenue in the range of $21.3 million to $21.9 billion, up 7% at the midpoint compared to 2023, reflecting 7 points of growth over market. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $3.28 billion and $2.55 billion at the midpoint, reflecting strong flow-through on volume growth, continued margin expansion and higher growth product lines and operating performance and cost reduction initiatives to offset increasing labor heads, including higher-than-expected labor inflation in Mexico as well as the stronger peso. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated to be between $5.55 and $6.05. EPS growth of 19% is primarily driven by strong earnings and lower interest expense partially offset by an increase in the expected tax rate of 17.5%.\nAs I will discuss further, we are targeting share repurchases of $750 million in 2024 and have reflected a full year benefit estimate of $0.05 per share at the midpoint of our guidance. As it relates to Motional, as Kevin mentioned earlier, Aptiv will not participate in future funding rounds. Despite the continued progress made by the Motional team on their technology road map, given the pushout of the commercialization of the Level 4, 5 robotaxi business model, we now under believe capital allocation to Motional is appropriate for Aptiv. In addition, we are also exploring steps to reduce the significant portion of our common equity holdings working within the construct of the joint venture agreement, we will look to sell or otherwise reduce our holdings during 2024, reducing the dilutive earnings per share impact of the emotional losses on Aptiv's earnings.\nGiven that the exact timing of the reduction in shareholdings is not yet known, we have included the expected full year impact of Motional's losses in our current outlook, a noncash equity loss of approximately $340 million or $1.20 of earnings per share. Moving to cash flow. We expect 2024 operating cash flow of $2.3 billion driven by higher earnings. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenues.\nFinally, although we are not providing quarterly guidance in 2024, we did want to provide some perspective on calendarization during the year as both revenue growth and earnings are weighted towards the second half. Our full year guidance assumes adjusted revenue growth in the first half of the year of 3% to 5%, adjusted growth in the second half of the year accelerated to 9% to 10% and is weighted towards the fourth quarter. With respect to earnings, consistent with the higher level of revenue growth and the previously noted cyclicality in the business, margins will expand throughout the year, similar to 2023.\nOn Slide 16, we provide a bridge of 2024 revenue and operating income guidance as compared to 2023. Starting with revenue. Our growth over market, combined with flat global vehicle production results in a net contribution of revenues of $1.2 billion. The full year benefit of material cost recoveries will effectively offset changes in commodity, prices and price downs, and FX is estimated at a positive $100 million.\nTurning to adjusted operating income. We expect margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint of our guide, driven by continued strong flow-through on incremental volumes, net price and commodities will offset, and we expect our strong operating performance in 2023 to continue in '24 as manufacturing and material performance as well as additional cost reduction actions are expected to offset incremental labor costs and nonmaterial inflation.\nIn summary, we remain focused on driving disciplined revenue growth while balancing investment in the business with increased levels of performance and expanding operating margins. Moving to Slide 17. We wanted to discuss our updated growth over market framework of 6% to 8%, down from our prior range of 8% to 10%. As we have discussed, our growth over market represents Aptiv's relative secular growth expectations, above global vehicle production. During the second half of 2023, our growth over market was negatively impacted by several factors, including the UAW strike, stronger Japanese OEM production in North America as well as a change in Chinese customer mix as local Chinese OEMs grew faster than multinational customers in China. When combined with the direct UAW strike impact, the OEM and customer mix reduced our growth over market in 2023 by approximately 5 points on a full year basis.\nAn additional slowdown in high-voltage growth driven by lower EV production and the exiting of a relationship with a smaller North American EV only producer accounted for a 2% decrease in growth over market. As we look out into 2024, we believe the impact of the UAW strike and the OEM production mix in North America effectively reverses. In addition, improved production schedules at our multinational Chinese OEM customers and our continued growth with local Chinese OEMs will contribute to higher growth over market in China. However, we are forecasting high voltage growth to slow to approximately 20% in 2024 consistent with the 2023 levels, but down from pre 2023 levels of approximately 30%.\nOur updated framework of 6% to 8% incorporates these changes as well as the continued contribution from our active safety, engineered components and commercial vehicle product lines. Slide 18 provides an update on our multiyear margin expansion performance. As noted, we saw very strong margin expansion in 2023, exceeding the expectations we laid out last February. Operating income margin expanded 150 basis points over 2022, despite the strike impact of $80 million in foreign exchange headwinds of over $100 million. Strong flow-through on sales growth was partially offset by net price and commodities as a slight headwind, and we saw significant reductions in supply chain disruption costs and the operating teams drove incremental material and manufacturing performance more than offsetting the impact of higher labor and operating costs. The accomplishments of last year provided a strong jumping off point for 2024 as we target a 120 basis point margin expansion at the midpoint of our guide.\nIn addition to the ongoing performance initiatives. During the second half of 2023, we also took several cost reduction actions to help bolster our overall performance and help ensure achievement of the 2024 margin expansion. These additional actions as well as our continued focus on our overall cost structure and footprint are necessary as we expect to see continued labor and operating cost pressures, particularly in our Mexico operations over the coming years. We are also forecasting the peso to remain at a relatively strong level in 2024.\nBefore handing the call back to Kevin, I'd like to touch upon our continued strong performance as it relates to cash flow generation and capital allocation. We generated a record $1.9 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to continue to maintain a disciplined and accretive track record of capital deployment. In 2023, we continue to invest in the business focusing on longer-term growth and innovation. In addition, we opportunistically delevered by paying down our $300 million term loan A, resulting in a full year earnings per share benefit of $0.05 in 2024. In addition, we purchased $400 million of stock, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. Looking at 2024, we expect operating cash flow to increase to $2.3 billion and we will continue to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation.\nIn addition to both investing in organic and inorganic opportunities, we are forecasting additional share repurchases in 2024 targeting a total of $750 million in the year. While we will continue to maintain our current financial policy as it relates to our balance sheet and leverage profile. As we have discussed in the past, our sustainable business model and a relentless focus on operating performance enables us to convert more income to cash, allowing Aptiv to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation that we believe helps drive shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 20 before opening the line up for questions. As the management team reflects on 2023, we expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate and drive ongoing transformation across industries. Aptiv is perfectly positioned to benefit from this change having identified the safe, green and connected mega trends over a decade ago. We have a purpose built -- we have purpose-built our portfolio to provide flexible, high-performance and cost-effective solutions that address our customers' greatest challenges all on a global scale.\nAt the same time, we remain committed to flawless execution and operational excellence, enabling us to unlock incremental profitability and deliver value to our shareholders. In closing, I'm proud of what the Aptiv team accomplished during 2023, and I'm excited about what we will deliver in the years ahead. Operator, let's now open the line for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jane Wu, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\n\nJane Wu\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Corporate Development and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Madri. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items, and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our third quarter financials as well as our full year 2023 outlook, are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information that reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Jane. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3.\nWe delivered another strong quarter, exceeding our expectations despite some headwinds. Touching on a few of the highlights. New business bookings totaled $6.6 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $27 billion. Revenues increased 7% to $5.1 billion, 2 points over the growth and vehicle production, reflecting double-digit growth in ASUX revenues and S&PS revenue growth in line with global vehicle production. The impact of UAW strike in North America as well as customer mix.\nEBITDA and operating income were both records totaling $727 million and $560 million, respectively, reflecting solid flow-through on volume growth and ongoing operating performance initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable FX, timing related to customer recoveries and the impact of the UAW strike. We expect continued sequential margin expansion as the headwinds related to supply chain disruptions continue to dissipate, customer recoveries are closed and the benefits from further cost structure actions take hold. The team remains laser focused on continuing this trend in the fourth quarter and into 2024 and beyond.\nTurning to Slide 4. Touching on the key themes and macro trends that have had an impact on our operations this year. Our customer relationships and new business bookings are stronger than ever, driven by robust demand for smart vehicle compute and software, high-voltage electrification and ADAS solutions. As automotive OEMs continue on the path toward fully electrified software-defined vehicles, we are their partner of choice, delivering unique full system solutions that provide enhanced features and greater flexibility, all at lower cost. We're also benefiting from the transition to the software-defined future across several other industries with opportunities in the commercial vehicle, telecom, A&D and industrial markets.\nGlobal automotive vehicle production has been stronger than we initially forecasted as easing supply chain constraints have led to fewer disruptions enabling increased production. Our strong year-to-date results had put us well on our way to reach the top end of the full year guidance we laid out in early August. However, the UAW strike, which affected the production schedules of our top 3 North American OEM customers has had an impact on both our third and fourth quarter results.\nWhile tentative agreements have been reached with all 3 North American OEMs, there remains some uncertainty on vehicle build schedules as the OEMs work to finalize their plans to ramp up production during the balance of the fourth quarter. Our operating teams in North America are working closely with our customers and supply chain partners to help accelerate the ramp-up of production and minimize any potential disruptions.\nMoving to Slide 5. As already mentioned, new business bookings during the quarter were $6.6 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to a record $27 billion, on track for our target of $32 billion for the full year. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $2.2 billion, driven by over $1 billion in active safety awards. Signal and Power Solutions bookings reached $4.4 billion, including $1.1 billion in bookings for our high-voltage electrification solutions split across geographies, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.3 billion, already surpassing last year's record of $4.2 billion.\nAs OEM strategies around their vehicle architecture platforms evolve, 1 constant will be the need for solutions that deliver improved performance at a lower cost. And Aptiv is perfectly positioned to leverage our full system capabilities to enable a fully electrified software-defined vehicle.\nTurning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's third quarter highlights. Revenues increased 13%, 8 points above vehicle production, the result of a 30% increase in active safety revenues reflecting strength across all regions as a launch of our Level 2 and Level 2+ ADAS solutions continue to ramp.\nOperating income totaled $109 million, reflecting a 7.6% operating margin, an increase over the prior period, but sequentially lower than the second quarter due to the seasonality of Wind River revenues and the timing of customer recoveries. New business bookings totaled $2.2 billion and included $1.2 billion of active safety customer awards, including a major award with a large German truck manufacturer, underscoring the strength of our high-performance radar technologies and their applications outside of the automotive industry.\nAs demand continues to increase for more advanced Aptiv safety solutions, our unique insights, improved domain expertise position Aptiv to deliver differentiated value to our customers. To that end, we're excited to have recently launched our automated parking solution, an additional feature to our AI/ML enhanced Generative ADAS platform to address complex parking scenarios. Aptiv's unique solution enables fully modularized automated parking features that scale from Level 2 to Level 4, from auto parking assist and memory parking all the way to auto part [ relay ]. Automated parking is just 1 of the many features that we have under development in our Gen 6 ADAS technology road map which will scale to a full Level 3 ADAS platform in 2026.\nTurning to the Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 7. The Third quarter revenues increased 5%, in line with global vehicle production. High voltage revenues increased 13%, reflecting strong growth across all product lines, partially offset by customer mix in Europe and Asia, and the impact of the UAW strike in North America. The $4.4 billion in S&PS bookings that I mentioned previously included a low-voltage architecture award with a Chinese OEM and demonstrating the progress we're making further penetrating the local Chinese OEMs.\nAnother strong quarter for Intercable Automotive with $400 million in new business awards, including a major award with a global customer in North America reflecting continued strong commercial traction and a high-voltage system award with a European OEM that includes products across our electrical distribution, connection systems and Intercable automotive portfolios, demonstrating how our full system approach sets us apart from the competition.\nLastly, we're proud to announce that Aptiv has once again been recognized as an automotive PACE Award finalist. A Rapid Power Reserve solution is a groundbreaking technology that provides a highly reliable, redundant power source for a variety of critical functions, eliminating the need for a low-voltage battery in the vehicle significantly reducing weight, mass and costs. This recognition validates Aptiv's industry-leading technology as well as the value and impact our continuous innovation, provides our customers.\nTurning to Slide 8. We're excited to showcase many of our new innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January next year. We are vision of the future reality, including vehicles with Aptiv smart vehicle architecture, running applications for next-generation ADAS and in-cabin user experience. Vehicles with our complete portfolio of optimized electrical vehicle solutions purpose-built for demanding power requirements and Wind River's edge to cloud platforms, supporting the latest safe, green and connected applications from Aptiv. We'll be providing live demonstrations of how we're leveraging our deep insights into the brain and nervous system of the vehicle, along with Wind River's proven software technology to develop optimized and scalable solutions that meet OEM needs for performance, flexibility and lower costs.\nMoving to Slide 9. In recognition of our strong commitment to innovation, operational excellence and sustainability, Aptiv was recently named by Newsweek as 1 of America's Greenest companies. At Aptiv, our business strategy is directly aligned with our sustainability goals. We provide solutions of the highest quality, designed, developed and manufactured responsibly that enable a safer, greener and more connected world. In doing so, we take care of our people and our communities while minimizing our carbon footprint. Sustainability is an enterprise-wide commitment, and I'm proud of our entire team for helping us to achieve our goals and ensuring that our company, our customers and our planet continue to thrive.\nMoving to Slide 10. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to touch on our current view of 2024. Building on the solid foundation we've established in 2023, we're well positioned for continued strong revenue growth and margin expansion despite the macro headwinds. Our safe, green and connected product portfolio is perfectly aligned to the demand for feature-rich electric vehicles as well as the acceleration of the software-defined future in adjacent markets. Our advanced technologies and capabilities will continue to drive strong performance across multiple industries.\nWhile some macro uncertainties remain, we're confident in our ability to execute policy in a dynamic environment.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 11.\nAs Kevin highlighted, Aptiv reported another quarter of strong financial results, exceeding our expectations despite the impact of the UAW strike in North America. Revenue was up 7% to $5.1 billion or 2% above underlying vehicle production, excluding the impact of acquisitions.\nAs I will discuss shortly, our growth over market was negatively impacted by the UAW strike in North America as well as customer mix and program timing in Europe and China. Active safety and high-voltage electrification reported strong double-digit growth of 30% and 13%, respectively, and the UAW strike had a negative impact on revenue in the quarter of approximately $80 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA and operating income were $727 million and $560 million, respectively, reflecting strong flow-through on increased volumes, continued progress on our ongoing performance initiatives including reductions in supply chain disruption costs that more than offset higher labor costs. The UAW strike had a negative impact of approximately $30 million and foreign exchange was a headwind versus last year.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were $1.30, an increase of $0.02 from the prior year, primarily driven by the higher operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense. Operating cash was $746 million, a significant increase over prior year, primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital levels. Capital expenditures were flat to prior year at $212 million.\nLooking at revenue in more detail on Slide 12. The Revenue in the third quarter was $5.1 billion, reflecting sales growth of $299 million, representing adjusted growth of 7%. The Wind River and Intercable acquisitions add at the $153 million of revenue and net price in commodities as well as foreign exchange were slightly positive in the quarter. From a regional perspective, North America revenues was up 10%, reflecting 2 points of growth over market at the UAW strike negatively impacted D3 customer volumes relative to overall North American vehicle production in the quarter.\nIn Europe, revenue grew 10% or 4 points above underlying vehicle production, driven by strong growth in active safety, partially offset by program timing and slowing growth for certain BEV platforms.\nIn China, revenue was in line with underlying vehicle production due to our customer mix and slowing BEV growth.\nAs noted earlier, despite the lower growth over market, our Q3 adjusted growth and revenue were in line with our expectations. The lower growth over market in North America is consistent with the strike impact we experienced in 2019. And as we have said in the past, growth over market will be lumpy given customer mix and program timing.\nMoving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Revenue rose 13% in the quarter or 8 points over vehicle production. The outperformance was driven by strength in active safety, where revenue was up 30%. User Experience was down 5% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of certain customer programs and a more difficult year-over-year comparison. Price downs in the quarter were less than 1%.\nSegment adjusted operating income was $109 million, up 35% when compared to the same period last year. Year-over-year ASUX margins in the quarter were natively impacted by the timing of certain material inflation recoveries from customers, which partially offset the flow-through on incremental volumes and improved performance. Also, ASUX margins were lower on a sequential basis versus Q2 2023 due to expected seasonality in Wind River's Q3 results. We had noted the seasonality at the start of the year. The Q3 impact of this UAW strike on ASUX was relatively minimal, reflecting approximately $10 million of revenue and $5 million of operating income.\nTurning to Signal and Power on Slide 14. Performance in the quarter was strong despite a challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter was $3.7 million, an increase of 5%, in line with vehicle production despite a negative strike impact of approximately $70 million of revenue or 2 points of growth. High-voltage electrification grew 13% in the quarter, reflecting a slowdown in growth rate from prior quarters.\nDespite the slowing of EV production, we continue to expect our high-voltage business to have a strong double-digit growth in 2023.\nPrice downs in the quarter were less than 1%. Segment adjusted operating income was $451 million in the quarter, up 2% from prior year, including a $25 million negative strike impact.\nOperating performance, including lower supply chain disruption costs were positive in the quarter and offset the negative impact of higher labor costs. Customer recoveries offset material inflation and the negative commodity impact in the quarter, while foreign exchange, primarily the peso and RMB continue to present a headwind on a year-over-year basis. However, the FX impact is in line with the updated guidance we provided in August.\nAdjusting for the impact of FX and the strike, adjusted EBIT margins for Signal and Power Solutions were 13.3% in the quarter.\nMoving to cash generation and the strength of Aptiv's balance sheet on Slide 15. As we have discussed in the past, our focus on cash flow generation and cash conversion is as disciplined as our operational improvement efforts. The past quarter was a clear example of that as we saw the results of our efforts to reduce the higher working capital levels we maintained during the recent supply chain disruptions. Despite the operating challenges in North America, we were able to improve operating cash flow by over $300 million versus prior year resulting in cash flow conversion of 200% in the quarter and an ending cash balance of $1.8 billion.\nGiven this strong performance in October, we opportunistically paid down our $300 million term loan, Aptiv's most expensive borrowing, increasing our average tenor from 15 to 16 years.\nAs we have discussed in the past, our sustainable business model is enabling us to convert more income to cash, and we believe there is no shortage of attractive deployment opportunities as we continue to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation, including prioritizing organic investment in the business to support our portfolio of advanced technologies and [ recording ] business awards, executing our M&A strategy by focusing on transactions that enhance our scalability, accelerate our speed to market with relevant technologies and access new markets, maintaining our current financial policy as it relates to our leverage profile and opportunistically returning cash to shareholders.\nI will wrap up with our full year outlook on Slide 16. Given our continued strong performance and a higher outlook for global vehicle production, we are maintaining our full year outlook for 2023 despite the impact of the North American strike. Key assumptions now underpinning our outlook include global vehicle production up 6% plus for the year versus a buyer estimate of 4% driven by higher expected production levels in Europe and China, no significant strike impact beyond October 2023. During the month of October, we experienced a negative strike impact of $100 million in revenue and $50 million in operating income. Our outlook assumes a restart of customer production and a return to pre-strike production levels over the coming couple of weeks and no further meaningful disruptions.\nAccordingly, we expect revenue in the range of $19.95 billion to $20.25 billion, including the impact of total loss strike revenue of $180 million. I would note that while our revenue and adjusted growth rate remain unchanged, given the Q4 strike impact, we are forecasting our growth over market for 2023 to be below our long-term forecast range of 8% to 10%. EBITDA and operating income are still expected to be approximately $2.8 billion and $2.1 billion at the midpoint, respectively, including total loss strike earnings of $80 million. No change to adjusted earnings per share of $4.75 at the midpoint and operating cash flow of approximately $2 billion.\nAs Kevin will discuss further in his closing remarks, despite the macro challenges of the North American strike and the significant foreign exchange headwinds, our relentless focus on improving operating performance and cash flow generation has allowed us to continue to deliver in a difficult operating environment.\nWith that, I'll hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 17 before we open the line for questions. As Joe and I have discussed, we experienced strong underlying business performance in the third quarter, driven by further easing of supply chain constraints, which partially offset leering headwinds related to material and labor inflation, unfavorable FX rates and the UAW strike in North America. We continue to see tremendous momentum in new business awards and are well on our way to reaching our bookings target of roughly $32 billion by year-end.\nWhile our teams continue to work tirelessly to mitigate the impact of the UAW strike in North America, including the ramp-up of North American production, we're executing on further cost structure actions to enhance our operational resiliency. Our portfolio of advanced technologies and strong operating execution gives us confidence in our ability to further strengthen our competitive position and deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\nOperator, let's now open the line for questions."

Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3. We delivered a record quarter, demonstrating outperformance in an improving supply chain environment. Touching on a few of the highlights. Revenue increased 25% to $5.2 billion, a new record for quarterly revenue, representing 10 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, driven by strong demand across our portfolio as well as across all geographic regions.\nRevenues in our active safety and high-voltage electrification product line increased almost 50%, underscoring the strength of our safe, green and connected product portfolio. EBITDA and operating income totaled a record $695 million and $530 million, respectively, reflecting solid flows on volume growth and fewer supply chain disruptions. Partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and ongoing material and labor inflation.\nNew business bookings totaled $6.1 billion, further validating our industry-leading portfolio, the strength of our customer relationships and our ability to execute flawlessly in a dynamic environment. Turning to Slide 4. Our first half performance substantially in line with our expectations. New business bookings totaled over $20 billion, driven by customer awards for our SBA compute and software, high-voltage electrification, user experience and active safety solutions. Record revenue, representing 20% growth, 8 points over underlying vehicle production, in line with our long-term framework, record EBITDA and operating income as well as significant year-over-year margin expansion. The result of strong volume growth and increased operating efficiencies, partially offset by the headwinds I mentioned on the prior slide.\nAnd we're ahead of plan for both Wind River and Intercable automotive solutions with both companies experiencing an uptick in commercial engagements and customer awards. Although supply chain issues persist we experienced a sequential improvement in the supply of semiconductors resulting in more stable vehicle production schedules. From a macro and industry perspective, global vehicle production has been strong, with the North American and European markets being the most resilient.\nGiven the current industry backdrop, we're updating our outlook for the full year. We now expect global vehicle production to increase 3% to 4%, principally driven by stronger vehicle production in North America and Europe. Our updated outlook does not take into account any labor disruption in North America, although we do recognize that this is a real risk. Joe will provide a more granular update on our revised outlook when we review the financials. Regardless of the market backdrop, we remain laser-focused on enhancing our portfolio of safe, green and connected solutions, executing on our commercial strategy and optimizing our business model, which will continue to position us to benefit from the secular tailwinds.\nMoving to Slide 5. As I already mentioned, new business bookings during the quarter were $6.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to over $20 billion. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $1.7 billion, driven by $1 billion in user experience bookings, including awards for Aptiv's integrated cockpit controller and driver state sensing solutions. Signal and Power Solutions bookings reached $4.4 billion, including $1.4 billion in bookings for our high-voltage electrification solutions comprised of awards across our high-voltage product portfolio, with both traditional and new battery electric vehicle manufacturers.\nGiven the strength of our commercial pipeline, we have clear line of sight to exceed last year's $4.2 billion in high-voltage business awards, and we remain highly confident in achieving our full year earnings target of $32 billion. further validating the strength of our portfolio of advanced technologies and our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers.\nTurning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's second quarter highlights. ASUX achieved record revenue of $1.5 billion, increasing 24 points above underlying vehicle production. Active safety revenues increased 49%, with strength across North America, Europe and China as the launch of our Level 2 and Level 2+ ADAS solutions continue to ramp. User Experience revenues increased 33%, driven by volume growth across key programs in both Europe and North America. And lastly, smart vehicle compute and software revenue grew 30%, reflecting Wind River's commercial success in both the automotive and nonautomotive markets, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide.\nIn terms of new business bookings, we were awarded over $400 million of active safety bookings, including program extension awards with a North American customer. As I mentioned, we're also awarded roughly $1 billion of user experience bookings, including a significant program extension with the VW Group. This particular award is for an integrated cockpit controller first launch on the Porsche Taycan and now being rolled out across numerous other vehicle platforms. As vehicle life cycles get shorter the ability to cost effectively extend our solutions across both luxury and mass market vehicle platforms, reinforces Aptiv's value as a strategic partner. And as demand increases for more advanced active safety and user experience solutions, the need for more advanced compute, software development and integration capabilities as required. Our ability to provide a full suite of flexible platform solutions that are cost-effective, while providing our customers with choice, differentiates us from our competitors. And as a result, we've experienced an increase in the number of strategic customer engagements and are confident that additional business awards will follow later this year.\nMoving to Slide 7. Wind River delivers edge to cloud software solutions for mission-critical applications, enabling software to find systems that require the highest levels of safety, security and performance. The Wind River team has done a great job increasing the partner ecosystem while also winning new business, particularly in the aerospace and defense, telecom and automotive markets, including a new program award for an A&D customer GMV to provide its edge software and with a global European truck manufacturer to provide its Linux edge software and services for their next-generation communication gateway, providing a nice entree into the commercial vehicle market. The Wind River team continues to be actively engaged with several automotive customers on enabling the software-defined vehicle of the future.\nIn addition, they've announced several new partnerships to expand their ecosystem, including with Samsung to develop a fully integrated software and hardware solution for the automotive industry. This solution will be enabled by Wind River's Helix virtualization platform, which will allow end users to utilize a diverse set of runtime environments, including the VX Works RTOS, Linux and Android.\nLast month, the team also announced a strategic collaboration with Horizon Robotics to provide Wind River's complete edge to cloud portfolio for Verizon's automated driving compute solutions for the China market. These partnerships in automotive, along with Wind River's continued commercial success, in its traditional markets, allow Aptiv to capitalize on the transition to a more software-defined future.\nTogether with Wind River, Aptiv is well positioned to provide cloud-native software solutions that help customers reduce complexity, while enabling flexibility, lower total system cost, faster speed to market and new business models. In order to provide you with a deeper look at our software strategy, the value that we can deliver to customers, we'll be hosting a software teaching in September. We're excited to tell you more about the Active Win River opportunity, and we'll provide more details as we get closer to the date.\nTurning to the Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 8. S&PS second quarter revenues increased 21%, 6 points over vehicle production, the result of strong revenue growth in China as we lapped the COVID disruptions during the second quarter last year, a 48% increase in high-voltage revenues, reflecting strong growth across all regions and product lines, and a 32% increase in commercial vehicle revenues. The $1.4 billion in high-voltage bookings that I mentioned previously included another strong quarter from Intercable automotive, which I'll touch on in more detail on the next slide.\nMultiple awards with the Hyundai Motor Group, including for both power distribution and battery pack electrical architecture, High Voltage Electrical Center award, a global European truck manufacturer, further increasing our penetration of the commercial vehicle market as it begins to transition to battery electric vehicle platforms.\nMoving to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, we're on our way to exceeding last year's record of $4.2 billion of high-voltage bookings. We continue to enhance the breadth of our high-voltage product portfolio as we introduce new offerings in power electronics and battery management systems. And the addition of Intercable automotive solutions expands our portfolio to include high-voltage bus bars, solid-state electrical centers and battery cell interconnect solutions, further widening our competitive moat.\nWe expect Intercable revenues to increase roughly 30% per year over the next several years, strengthening our position as the only full system provider of high-voltage solutions. With approximately $1 billion in bookings year-to-date Intercable has already exceeded its 2022 full year bookings amount. And their pipeline for 2023 new business award is now more than $2 billion, validation of the strength of their best-in-class high-voltage electrification technologies.\nAlready a market leader with European customers, Intercable recently launched production from 1 of Aptiv's facilities in North America, with customer deliveries scheduled to begin this quarter. In addition to what Interconnect brings, we continue to experience significant commercial interest in our growing portfolio of power electronics and battery management system solutions for both battery producers and high-volume battery electric vehicle manufacturers.\nWith our unique portfolio of high-voltage solutions and full system capabilities, we're perfectly positioned to be the partner of choice for customers around the world as they transition to an optimized electrified vehicle architecture. Moving to Slide 10. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to take a minute to recognize an important achievement by the Aptiv team. In July, Aptiv was recognized by Volkswagen with the prestigious W Group Award 1 of just a handful of suppliers. Aptiv was chosen for more than [ 4,000 ] suppliers for the top spot in the category of Global Performance Champion recognition for our product innovation and ability to keep Volkswagen connected during these challenging times.\nThe VW and Aptiv strategies are fully aligned and our teams have been working closely over the last 3 years to design and develop the vehicle architecture that will enable the software-defined vehicle of the future. The Aptiv team is extremely proud of this award and looks forward to continuing to innovate and further strengthen our long-standing and strategic partnership with the VW Group.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 11. As Kevin highlighted, Aptiv reported another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting robust execution across both segments and continued improvement in operating performance. Revenues were up\n[Audio Gap]\n$5.2 billion or 20% above underlying vehicle production, excluding the impact of acquisitions. With outgrowth driven in part by strength in our ASUX segment, particularly in active safety as well as continued traction in our high-voltage and commercial vehicle product lines. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $695 million and $530 million, respectively, reflecting flow-through on increased volumes of approximately 30%, continued progress on our ongoing performance initiatives, including a $70 million improvement in supply chain disruption costs from last year and margin headwinds of 90 basis points from FX and commodities primarily due to the stronger Mexican peso and weaker Chinese RMB.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were $1.25, an increase of $1.03 from the prior year, driven by higher operating income, which more than offset the negative FX and commodity impact. Operating cash was $535 million, which was $440 million above the same period last year, primarily driven by higher earnings and reduced working capital investment during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $222 million. Looking at revenues in more detail on Slide 12. The Revenue in the second quarter was a record $5.2 billion, representing adjusted growth of 25%. Growth was broad-based across regions and segments and our recent acquisitions added $176 million of revenue in the quarter.\nNet price and commodities were positive, more than offsetting the FX impact on revenue. From a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 19%, 4% above market, reflecting program timing at several customers with increased launch activity expected in the second half of the year. In Europe, revenues increased by 28%, 14% above market, supported by growth in active safety and user experience. In China, revenues grew 41% or 20% over market reflecting the strength of our underlying product portfolio, particularly in active safety and high voltage.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety User Experience revenues rose 39% in the quarter were [ 24 ] points over vehicle production. The outperformance was driven by strength in several product lines, including active safety where revenues were up 49%. Segment adjusted operating income was $138 million, up $168 million when compared to the same period last year, despite a 90 basis points headwind from FX, with strong flow-through on incremental volumes of approximately 30% as well as net price and operating performance that offset higher material and higher labor costs.\nSignal and Power revenues were up 21%, 6 points above market. Market outperformance was driven by strength in several key product lines, including high footage and commercial vehicle. Segment operating income totaled $392 million, up 61% from the prior year despite an FX and commodity headwind of 90 basis points. Driven by strong flow-through on incremental volumes, offsetting the net price and commodities impact as well as improvements in operating performance to lower disruption costs, which more than offset the impact of higher labor costs in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 14 and our updated 2023 macro outlook. We've increased our outlook for adjusted growth to 11% to 13% for the full year, a meaningful increase from our original range of 7% to 9%, and we continue to expect to outgrow the market by 9%. The change in outlook primarily reflects increases in customer production schedules in North America and Europe, resulting in vehicle production growth of approximately 4% and 5% at the midpoint, respectively.\nPlease note that our production outlook does not assume any significant North American labor disruptions. We expect China to be essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, in line with our prior guide. Although we continue to see strong EV penetration, particularly with our Chinese OEM customers. In addition to changes in vehicle production volumes, we have also expected current foreign exchange and commodity rates into the updated guide.\nThe next slide summarizes our updated 2023 outlook. We now expect revenue in the range of $19.95 billion to $20.25 billion. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion and $2.1 billion at the midpoint, respectively. This reflects year-over-year operating income flow-through of 21%, in line with our historical range of 18% to 22% despite significant FX and commodity headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.75 at the midpoint, up almost 40% from prior year, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher tax and interest expense.\nOperating cash flow of approximately $2 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over the prior guidance. Slide 16 walks prior guidance to our current outlook. Starting with revenue. Sales volume increases by $700 million, reflecting higher European and North American customer schedules. Net price, commodities and foreign exchange contributed positively to revenue driven by the rate changes I previously discussed. Adjusted operating income is up $125 million over prior guide as flow-through on sales growth and higher operating performance is partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the timing of copper price adjustments to our customers.\nNet pricing, which includes the impact of customer price downs price recoveries and material inflation remains in line with our original guidance. As previously discussed, the impact of foreign exchange movements, particularly the stronger pace for weaker RMB, have been significant this year, representing a $100 million headwind to the original guide. However, assuming rates for the balance of the year remain relatively consistent with the rates used in our updated guidance, including a stronger euro that partially offset a peso and RMB impact, we believe the majority of the negative impact has been reflected in the first half results.\nIn summary, we are pleased with Aptiv's year-to-date performance, including the continued growth of our key product lines, strong bookings and continued margin expansion. Our performance initiatives, including efforts to significantly reduce and ultimately eliminate disruption costs and to offset significant labor inflation are on track and will continue to build throughout the year. Although we remain cautious about potential negative macroeconomic conditions over the next few quarters and the potential for labor disruptions in North America, we remain confident in our ability to meaningfully outgrow vehicle production. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of stronger market conditions should be noted concerns not materialize.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 17 before opening the line for questions. 2023 is off to a good start with record first half revenues, EBITDA and operating income and strong margin expansion. We maintained our momentum on new business awards for optimized full system solutions that deliver increased performance at lower cost to our customers. Our outlook for industry volumes has increased and easing supply constraints have led to fewer production disruptions and improved operating efficiencies. And we continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure to further enhance our operational resiliency.\nOur culture of innovation and commitment to keeping our customers connected is clearly translating into strong commercial momentum, which gives us confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, maintain our track record of performance and deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\nOperator, let's now open the line for questions."

Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3. We had a strong start to the year, showcasing our ability to continue to execute in a dynamic macro environment.\nTouching on a few of the highlights. Revenue increased 15% to $4.8 billion, a new record for quarterly revenue, representing 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, supported by strength across all regions and product lines, particularly in our ASUX segment. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $437 million and $0.91 respectively, reflecting solid flow-through on volume growth and contributions from our recent acquisitions, Wind River and Intercable Automotive, partially offset by periodic supply chain disruptions and unfavorable foreign exchange and commodity prices.\nNew business bookings totaled $13.9 billion, driven by a record level of customer awards for our Smart Vehicle Architecture and high-voltage solutions, further demonstrating our strategic value to our customers as the industry accelerates towards the fully electrified software-defined vehicle.\nTurning to Slide 4. While the overall macro environment remains challenging, we're beginning to see supply chain improvements that are broadly in line with our expectations. Our 15% revenue growth in the first quarter was supported by a 9% increase in underlying global vehicle production, principally driven by stronger-than-forecasted customer schedules in North America and Europe.\nWe continue to benefit from consumer demand for more feature-rich, highly electrified vehicles, which could further accelerate with more stringent government regulations such as the recent EPA proposal that will result in electric vehicles representing at least half of U.S. new car sales in 2030.\nAlthough supply chain issues persist, we're now seeing sequential improvements in the overall supply of semiconductors, which has translated into more stable vehicle production schedules. While we work to position ourselves to benefit from these near- and long-term tailwinds, we remain focused on optimizing our business foundation, ensuring that we have the right talent and operational footprint to execute on our current and future platforms.\nWe continue to enhance our regional operating model and expand our global execution capabilities by rotating our engineering resources to technology centers located in India and Poland and establishing new engineering centers in Cairo, Egypt, in Monterrey, Mexico, which are emerging hubs for software talent. We also continue to address increasing material and labor inflation through supply chain resilience initiatives and the rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations.\nThe majority of our direct material spend is now mapped in our digital network model, providing greater visibility into our global supply chain and enabling us to better predict and minimize the impact of supply constraints. In addition, our execution of strategic long-term agreements for select semiconductors has better positioned us to secure supply for the future, ensuring that we're aligned to our customers' product road maps and solidifying our position as a reliable and trusted partner of choice.\nAnd lastly, we continue to shift manufacturing capacity with higher direct labor content to best cost countries or regions and invest in high-return production automation initiatives, all of which has enhanced our operating execution and position us well for commercial pursuits.\nMoving to Slide 5. The pace of our new business bookings is a true testament to the value that we bring to our customers, not just from the strength of our portfolio of advanced technologies, but also for a track record of strong execution. As mentioned, first quarter new business bookings totaled $13.9 billion, more than double last year's first quarter amount and just under last year's record quarterly booking of $14.2 billion.\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $6.4 billion, driven by $5 billion in Smart Vehicle Architecture bookings, which doubled our cumulative customer awards for SVA to a total of $10 billion over the last 2 years with eight different OEMs and nearly $1 billion in active safety bookings including global RADAR program with a Japan-based global OEM and a program with Geely, which represents the seventh OEM to adopt Aptiv's ADAP platform, leveraging our full system solutions to optimize ADAS performance up to L2+.\nSignal and Power Solutions new business bookings totaled $7.5 billion, including a record $1.8 billion in bookings for high-voltage electrification solutions comprised of awards from both traditional and new battery electric vehicle OEMs across our high-voltage electrical architecture and engineered components product lines. We continue to see a very balanced bookings profile, underscoring the strength of our high-voltage portfolio and providing a clear line of sight to exceed last year's $4.5 billion in high-voltage business awards.\nOverall, the pace of our strategic engagement with customers is only accelerating. And we remain highly confident in achieving our target of $32 billion in new business awards for the full year, further validation of the value we deliver as the only provider of end-to-end full system solutions.\nTurning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment highlights. In the first quarter, ASUX achieved record revenue of $1.4 billion, growing 9 points above underlying vehicle production. Growth in active safety was strong across all regions as production of our Level 2 and 2+ ADAS solutions continue to ramp while user experience grew in line with the market, consistent with our expectations.\nAs I mentioned, we're experiencing strong commercial momentum with our Smart Vehicle Architecture solution. The $5 billion of new business awards during the quarter includes a large zone control award with a major North American-based global OEM and an additional award from a major European-based global OEM for a central vehicle controller.\nDiving more deeply into our progress with Wind River, although the acquisition only closed at the end of last year, we've experienced an acceleration in customer engagements and potential revenue opportunities. In February, we announced our early success leveraging Wind River software offerings integrated into Aptiv's ADAS platform to support L2+ automation for the Geely program I mentioned earlier.\nAnd building off this early success in China, in March, a major local Chinese OEM selected Aptiv and Wind River for a joint advanced development program to design their next-generation vehicle architecture, spanning the full suite of software and hardware solutions from both Wind River and Aptiv.\nOutside of the automotive market, Wind River continues to expand its business across the other mission-critical industries it serves. Aerospace and defense and telecom companies, for example, are relying on Wind River solution to develop, deploy, operate and service their software-defined products. And there's been a tremendous amount of commercial activity in these markets year-to-date, including the expansion of Wind River's edge software within several leading aerospace and defense customers for dozens of new programs. And more recently, a significant deployment of 5G cloud-native capabilities to a major telco provider, further establishing the company's leadership in the 5G landscape where it powers the majority of 5G deployments with global operators.\nThese Wind River offerings were also showcased at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where Wind River successfully demonstrated how its studio platform is transforming the 5G and [ O-RAN ] space, which has led to increased dialogue and new opportunities with additional large global telco operators. We're confident that these strategic engagements will lead to additional customer awards in the months to come.\nTurning to the Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 7. We remain perfectly positioned to deliver next-gen vehicle architecture solutions that are optimized for weight, size and total system cost, all the way from the grid to the vehicle. SPS growth over market totaled 5% during the quarter, supported by strong outgrowth in China of 13%, which was partially driven by increased demand for battery electric vehicles and a 28% increase in high-voltage revenues, reflected strong growth across all regions.\nThe record $1.8 billion in high-voltage bookings during the quarter included a $400 million high-voltage charging award with the North American-based global OEM, which will be used across their BEV portfolio on platforms beginning to launch in early 2024. And our previously announced power electronics award with an integrated battery management system, spanning both hardware and software, demonstrating our ability to develop new products to further expand our competitive moat.\nMoving to our other key acquisition, Intercable Automotive. Strong growth in the quarter was driven by program launches with key European customers. In addition, Intercable booked $500 million in new business awards, reflecting continued market demand and commercial traction with multiple OEMs.\nDuring the quarter, we've made significant products expanding Intercable's operations in North America and China, now adding manufacturing capacity in Mexico to more effectively serve North American customers.\nAs the global technology leader in high-voltage bus bars and interconnects, Intercable continue to develop and expand its product portfolio. Intercable recently won their first cell-to-cell connection system award with a German OEM, making the first -- marking the first time they brought the technology from outside to inside the battery. Intercable's focus on continuous product innovation, combined with Aptiv support in expanding their global manufacturing capabilities has increased our pipeline of new business opportunities by 40% compared to last year with the funnel continuing to grow.\nMoving to Slide 8. Building on our full stack solution approach, we continue to see increased adoption of our Smart Vehicle Architecture platform. As already highlighted, we have now successfully transitioned from the introduction of smart vehicle compute as a concept back in 2017 to $10 billion in cumulative SVA bookings today. And the accelerating demand for battery electric vehicles is providing a further catalyst for OEMs to take a clean sheet approach in vehicle architecture.\nTo date, we've completed multiple advanced development programs for our smart vehicle solution and many of these programs have translated into new business awards, successfully validating that SVA can reduce complexity, improve scalability and unlock new software-enabled functionality, all while lowering the total system cost of the vehicle.\nWith the addition of Wind River, we're now seeing increased interest in Aptiv providing a full system solution for both hardware and software from our customers. The industry is recognizing that the underlying software architecture of the vehicle must be modernized alongside the hardware architecture in order to unlock the full value of the car of the future. This involves truly integrating and serverizing the compute platform while addressing the demands of safety critical real-time applications, all of which are SVA solution, including Wind River's cloud-enabled software platform can deliver.\nWe're now engaged in discussions with a number of OEMs around the world regarding the combined Aptiv-Wind River solution, particularly in China, where customers move faster and more quickly embrace what Wind River can enable in the software-defined vehicle. The automotive industry also needs to adopt to true DevOps approach in order to take full advantage of this new software-hardware architecture paradigm, creating new business models enabled by full life cycle management, which will lead to faster speed to market and increase flexibility, while at the same time, reducing software development, deployment and warranty costs for OEM customers.\nBefore I turn the call over to Joe, I want to take a minute on Slide 9 to reiterate how Aptiv is uniquely positioned to create long-term value. Our portfolio of advanced technologies enable optimized full system solutions that improve performance, that lower cost and accelerate the path to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle. Executing our strategy has positioned us to further leverage the accelerating safe, green and connected megatrends. And as a result, Aptiv is uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities in both the automotive and adjacent markets.\nAs we've shown in our first quarter results, we're solidly on track to meet our 2023 commitments and well on our way to delivering on our 2025 financial targets and are perfectly positioned to further expand our competitive moat and deliver continued outperformance as a fast-growing, more profitable business.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10. Aptiv delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, reflecting robust execution across both segments and sequential improvement in the supply chain, although disruptions still persist.\nRevenues were up 15% to a record $4.8 billion or 6% above underlying vehicle production without growth across all regions and strength in ASUX. Growth over vehicle production was driven by active safety and high-voltage launches in China and Europe. North America was negatively impacted by program timing and acute supply chain constraints with certain large North American customers, which are not expected to carry over to the remainder of the year. Note that our growth over vehicle production, excluding the impact of acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and operating income were $594 million and $437 million, respectively, reflecting flow-through on increased volumes at roughly 30%. And higher manufacturing and material performance, which offset an $80 million increase in labor costs in the quarter, and FX and commodities negatively impacted OI margins by 100 basis points, primarily due to a stronger Mexican peso and weaker RMB.\nAnd as Kevin noted, both Wind River and Intercable posted strong results for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Wind River saw strong growth in both the telecom and A&D end markets. And although that business may be lumpy on a quarterly basis, we remain on track for strong full year growth.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were $0.91, an increase of 44% from the prior year due to higher operating income, partially offset by higher tax expense and equity losses at notional. Operating cash was an outflow of $9 million, which was $193 million above the same period last year, primarily a result of lower year-over-year working capital investment during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $269 million, in line with our expectations to support launch and booking activity. And lastly, we completed $70 million in share repurchases in the quarter.\nLooking at the first quarter revenues on Slide 11. Our record revenue of $4.8 billion reflects growth across all regions driven by the ramp-up in key product lines and approximately $180 million from our recent acquisitions. Net price and the impact of commodities were a slight positive in the quarter, offset by the negative impact of FX headwinds.\nFrom a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 14% or 4% above market. Adjusted growth was driven by increases in active safety and a continued ramp-up of high voltage while negatively impacted by the program timing and supply chain constraints I noted earlier.\nIn Europe, revenues increased by 24% as volumes lapped the prior year impact of the Ukraine-Russia war and active safety programs continue to scale.\nIn China, revenues grew 10 points over market, driven in part by growth in high voltage as demand for battery electric vehicles remains strong and active safety, up over 30% in the quarter.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues rose 18% in the quarter or 9 points of growth over underlying vehicle production. Segment adjusted operating income was $63 million, up $47 million year-over-year or a 310 basis point improvement in margins as a result of strong flow incremental volume and higher material and manufacturing performance.\nSignal and Power revenues rose 14% in the period or 5 points above market. Segment operating income totaled $374 million in the quarter, a 90 basis point margin improvement despite the margin rate headwinds from FX and commodities, driven by strong flow-through on incremental volume, lower COVID and supply chain costs of $30 million and material and manufacturing performance improvements.\nTurning to Slide 13 and our 2023 macro outlook. We continue to believe that we have appropriately reflected the current market dynamics and our guidance for full year 2023, which reflects approximately 85 million units of global vehicle production. As discussed during our prior earnings call, we expect sequential improvement in the supply chain through the year. Ongoing supply chain disruptions and macro challenges are impacting overall customer production levels.\nTurning to our full year outlook on the next slide. As noted, our Q1 results were in line with our expectations. And accordingly, our full year financial outlook is unchanged from the guidance provided last quarter. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $18.7 billion to $19.3 billion, up 8% on the midpoint compared to prior year. EBITDA and operating income of approximately $2.7 billion to [ $2 billion ] at the midpoint, respectively, and earnings per share of $4.25. Despite near-term concerns about the broader macro environment, we remain confident that we are well positioned to deliver market outgrowth in the range of 8% to 10%.\nTurning to the next slide. Our strong outgrowth is supported by several key product lines, each of which are well aligned with the accelerating megatrends.\nStarting with our active safety business. Despite supply chain disruptions, Level 2 and 2+ platforms are continuing to scale, driving 30% adjusted growth in 2023. We also continue to make meaningful investments in our high-voltage electrification portfolio, further enabling Aptiv to provide the power and data infrastructure solutions required for the next-gen vehicle architectures. We expect our high-voltage product line to grow over 30% in 2023, driven by our strong legacy portfolio and then further benefiting from Intercable Automotive's differentiated modular bus bars and high-voltage --. Lastly, our smart vehicle compute and software product line, which we highlighted during our Capital Markets Day is expected to grow 20% this year on a pro forma basis. This largely reflects Wind River's already strong growth in middleware and DevOps outside of the automotive industry.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 16 before opening up the line for questions. As I mentioned, 2023 is off to a great start with customer market and supply chain tailwinds all contributing to our strong first quarter performance. Customer engagements for Aptiv's SVA solutions and Wind River software offerings are incredibly strong as we continue to deliver value by providing optimized full system solutions with increased performance at lower cost.\nAs expected, we've seen sequential improvements in the supply of constrained parts resulting in fewer production disruptions. And we continue to optimize our cost structure to improve our operational resiliency. That being said, we remain laser-focused on mitigating the impact of persistent macro challenges, including ongoing material and labor inflation as well as the periodic supply chain disruptions.\nIn summary, we're experiencing tremendous commercial momentum and we've never been more confident in our ability to execute our strategy, deliver on our commitments and maintain our track record of outperformance, all of which will drive sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\nOperator, let's now open up the line for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jessica Kourakos, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Kourakos\n\nVP of IR, Environmental, Social & Governance, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Lynnette. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and we'll address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q4 financials as well as our full year 2022 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, which reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, including uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.\nLet's begin on Slide 3. 2022 was another year with record new business bookings and strong growth over market, driven by our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies as well as our continued flows execution that's kept our customers connected in this challenging environment. Highlights for 2022 included $32 billion of new business bookings driven by significant active safety, high-voltage and smart vehicle architecture awards. $17.5 billion of revenues representing 15 points of growth over vehicle production during the quarter, bringing our full year growth over market to 11 points.\nOperating income and earnings per share for the full year of just under $1.6 billion and $3.41 respectively, reflected the benefit of strong revenue growth and customer recoveries and partially offset by costs related to COVID and ongoing supply chain disruptions, which Joe will cover in greater detail a little later. We also enhanced our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies with the additions of Wind River and Intercable Automotive, both of which closed during the fourth quarter. I'll expand on these as well as our enhancements to our operating model on the next slide.\nAs the industry transitions to fully electrified software-defined vehicles, we continue to enhance both our operating model and industry-leading portfolio to further strengthen our capabilities to solve our customers' toughest challenges. As legacy functional and domain-based architectures are increasingly replaced by approaches aligned after smart vehicle architecture, it impacts both the way we design and sell our solutions. This means further strengthening our one active account-based model, positioning us to engage earlier in the development process and, therefore, more effectively design, specify and deliver optimized solutions across our portfolio, resulting in stronger customer relationships and greater ability to capture value from all our full system solutions.\nWe further enhanced our regional operating model by increasing local capabilities and empowering those closest to the customer to address their needs quickly and efficiently.\nAdditionally, the continued rollout of our Net Promoter System has resulted in actionable insights to improve our efficiency, our resiliency and service levels, thereby increasing customer intimacy.\nLastly, proactive initiatives and risk mitigation actions related to our supply chain have contributed to our ability to keep customers connected through significant disruptions, giving them confidence in our ability to execute on current and future platforms.\nAt the same time, we recognize that the software defined electrified vehicles consumers are demanding will require innovative new solutions and we are investing organically and inorganically to position ourselves for that future.\nOur acquisition of Wind River significantly strengthens our capabilities in software with an industry-first cloud data software platform. The speeds development, streamlines deployment and enables full life cycle management for the software-defined vehicle, significantly reducing cost and time to market for our customers, while also unlocking new business models.\nThe acquisition of Intercable Automotive enhances our portfolio of high-voltage bus bar and interconnect technologies and provides near-term synergies as we expand Intercable's manufacturing capacity in North America and in China.\nLastly, we are also investing organically in solutions that further expand our portfolio of industry-leading high-voltage electrification solutions such as integrated power electronics and battery management systems.\nTo help fund these initiatives, we have implemented structural cost reductions that will save roughly $100 million in annual expense, which will take full effect throughout 2023.\nThese actions further improve the efficiency of our underlying cost structure while allowing us to make investments that better position Aptiv for long-term outperformance.\nAs shown on Slide 5, nowhere is the strength of our track record and portfolio more evident than in our new business bookings performance. 2022 bookings reached a record $32 billion, an increase of over 3% from last year's record of $24 billion. Advanced safety and user experience bookings totaled a record $12 billion, driven by $4.2 billion of customer awards for our smart vehicle architecture solutions across 3 different OEMs, including central vehicle controller and Power Data Center Bookings with the Volkswagen Group, bringing cumulative customer awards for SBA products since our launch to over $5 billion with 5 different OEMs.\nActive safety bookings of $5.2 billion, representing a combination of next-gen hardware and perception software building blocks as well as full system turnkey awards, including an award from a large European-based global OEM as well as the Chinese OEM BYD, which represents the seventh customer to select Aptiv scalable platform to efficiently support a wide range of advanced safety features.\nThe strength of our portfolio of active safety solutions is reflected in the $20 billion of cumulative bookings since 2018.\nSignal Power Solutions New business bookings reached a record $20 billion for the year, the result of strong growth in low voltage vehicle architecture, including a $2 billion like commercial vehicle booking with a major North American OEM in the fourth quarter and continued strong bookings in adjacent markets. A record $4.2 billion of high-voltage electrification bookings, up from roughly $2 billion just a few years ago, including awards from several North American, European and China-based OEMs, representing both traditional and new mobility providers across our electrical architecture and engineered components product lines, bringing cumulative high-voltage customer awards to $14 billion since 2018.\nOur industry-leading portfolio, combined with our unparalleled ability to execute highly complex programs, even in today's challenging environment positions us to continue to win new business, resulting in clear line of sight to roughly $32 billion of business awards during 2023.\nMoving to Slide 6 to review the segment highlights. Beginning with the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment. This past year, we became the first technology provider to successfully launch a full stack ANS free Level 2+ ADAS system with a European-based global OEM. This is a great example of our full system capabilities applied to active safety as well as our flexible business model and open platform approach, which allows OEMs to leverage their own innovations, as well as those from Aptiv and other third parties to deliver a unique, high-performing driving experience.\nWe are also deeply engaged with several customers regarding Wind River's cloud-native software platform which we are confident will lead to commercial awards over the course of 2023.\nTurning to Signal and Power Solutions segment, we continue to be perfectly positioned with an industry-leading portfolio of electrification solutions that span multi-voltage distribution, connection and cable management.\nReflecting the accelerating demand for battery electric vehicles, the $4.2 billion of high-voltage new business bookings I referenced on the prior slide, accounted for over 20% of the segment's total bookings, and high-voltage revenues increased 33% over the prior year, 28 points over vehicle production.\nIn addition, our new offerings in power electronics and battery management systems are gaining traction as demonstrated by a significant integrated power electronics and BMS award from a North American-based global OEM, where a solution will be used across all their best platforms beginning in 2025. And the pipeline of customers evaluating the deployment of a similar solution is growing.\nOur customers recognize our track record of flawless execution, which is a driver behind the customer service, quality and supply chain awards we received. The cost recoveries we negotiated and the record level of new business bookings we've been awarded.\nOur full system edge-to-cloud vehicle architecture solutions have enabled us to pursue high-growth margin accretive opportunities that position us to continue to deliver outsized revenue growth and margin expansion for years to come.\nMoving to Slide 7. At this year's CES event in Las Vegas, we brought the software-defined vehicle to life, showcasing Aptiv's unique full stack capabilities. We debuted Wind River software platform, fully integrated with a vehicle powered by SBA. Designed vehicle demonstration of the industry's first end-to-end cloud-native tool chain and vehicle software platform, showed how these solutions improve development speed, quality and efficiency, unlock new business models and enable software functionality to evolve and improve over the life cycle of the vehicle. We also showcased our turnkey Gen 6 ADAS platform, including differentiating KPIs and a public road demonstration. Our radar-centric solution, which is vision agnostic, utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to increase the availability, robustness and efficiency of the perception system, resulting in a solution that can be up to 65% more energy efficient, and 25% more cost effective than equivalent vision-centric solutions.\nLastly, we continue to highlight the commercial readiness of our Smart Vehicle Architecture solution. First, by deeply integrating it into a production vehicle, which enabled us to demonstrate a wide range of in-cabin user experience features as well as the fusion of our interior and exterior sensing, resulting in greater safety, comfort and convenience for passengers.\nAnd second, through our SBA demonstrator, which enabled guests to see firsthand how these advanced architectures reduce complexity, weight and mass while also showcasing our latest high-voltage electrification solutions.\nWith over 400 customers, 150 partners and 75 suppliers visiting the Aptiv PLC pavilion this year, we reinforced our growing pipeline of commercial opportunities and set the stage for the deeper, more tailored engagements, which I referenced earlier.\nMoving to Slide 8. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I wanted to touch on our outlook for 2023, which Joe will cover in more detail.\nBuilding on the foundation from 2022, we expect a very strong year for new business bookings, revenue growth over market and margin expansion. Our robust business model and portfolio of advanced technologies are resulting in sustainable value creation. We continue to widen our competitive moat with investments in advanced technologies and capabilities that drive our operational excellence. This has enabled us to demonstrate strong outperformance even in a weak production environment. As demonstrated by our 2023 outlook, where we continue to expect 8 to 10 points of growth over vehicle production, and 140 basis points of operating margin expansion and strong cash flow growth.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior VP of Business Operations & CFO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the fourth quarter on Slide 9. As highlighted earlier, the business drove strong growth in the quarter with revenues of $4.6 billion, up 19% over prior year and representing 15 points of growth above underlying vehicle production. The outgrowth was across both segments despite continued semiconductor supply chain constraints and COVID disruptions in China that negatively impacted customer production. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $674 million and $523 million, respectively. OI margins expanded 380 basis points versus prior year, reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes, the benefit of customer recoveries of direct material cost increases and cost reduction actions taken earlier in 2022.\nSupply chain disruption costs were favorable by approximately $25 million from the prior year, and foreign exchange was negative in the quarter, reflecting approximately 20 basis points of headwind.\nEPS in the quarter was $1.27, an increase of 87% from the prior year, driven by overall earnings growth and interest income from higher cash balances maintained prior to the closing of Wind River partially offset by interest expense and tax expense on higher earnings.\nThe notional EPS impact was a loss of $0.29, an $0.08 increase over last year. Lastly, operating cash flow totaled $933 million and capital expenditures were $178 million for the quarter.\nLooking at the fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Our growth was broad-based across all regions despite the disruptions in China and continued supply chain constraints. Price downs, net cost recoveries and commodities was favorable by approximately $100 million. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue by approximately $300 million in the quarter and late quarter shutdowns in China was a negative $60 million.\nFrom a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 21% or 13% above market, driven by our active safety and high-voltage product lines. In Europe, which continues to be impacted by acute supply chain constraints and macro concerns, adjusted growth was 22%, driven by strength in both segments. And in China, revenues were up 8% or 14 points over market.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues rose 15% in the quarter or 11 points of growth over underlying vehicle production. Segment adjusted operating income was $77 million, up over 100% year-over-year, reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes as well as favorable net price and recoveries, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange in the quarter.\nSignal and Power revenues rose 20% in the period or 16 points above market. Segment operating income improved by 64%, driven by strong flow-through on incremental volumes. Favorable net price recoveries and commodities and lower supply chain disruption costs that partially offset the negative FX impact.\nTurning now to Slide 12 and our expectations for global vehicle production in 2023. Based on customer schedules, we are forecasting a decrease of 1% for the year reflecting approximately 85 million units of global production. Regionally, we expect North America flat at approximately 15 million units; Europe, down 2% or approximately 16 million units; and China flat at approximately 27 million units.\nAs we discussed during the fourth quarter of last year, we remain cautious about the impact of macroeconomic considerations, particularly in Europe as well as the impact of customer supply chain disruptions, including continued constraints of certain semiconductors.\nAlthough the overall supply of semiconductors has improved sequentially, we continue to see acute constraints, particularly in Europe and North America that impact overall customer production levels.\nMoving to Slide 13, you'll find our 2023 full year outlook, which now includes Wind River and Intercable Automotive. We expect revenue in the range of $18.7 million to $19.3 billion, up 8% at the midpoint compared to 2022, with 9 points of growth over market.\nNote that our growth over market excludes the impact of acquisitions. As noted previously, we remain confident in our multiyear growth over market target of 8% to 10%, supported by continued success in our key product lines and high demand for our portfolio of advanced technologies.\nEBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion and $2 billion at the midpoint, reflecting strong flow-through on volume growth, continued margin expansion in high-growth product lines and lower COVID supply chain disruption costs.\nAdjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization is estimated to be $4.25.\nEPS growth of 25% is driven by strong earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in the expected tax rate of 14.5% and higher net interest expense. The loss related to Motional of $310 million represents a $0.07 increase over last year. We expect 2023 operating cash flows of $1.9 billion reflecting the higher earnings as well as improved working capital during the year.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenues or $950 million for the year.\nWith respect to capital deployment in 2023, we will continue to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation as we continue to prioritize organic investments in the business,to support our portfolio of advanced technologies and record new business awards. Execute our M&A strategy and focus on transactions that enhance our scalability across both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle, accelerate our speed to market with relevant technologies and access new markets.\nAnd while we will continue to maintain our current financial policy as it relates to our balance sheet leverage profile to the extent we can take advantage of market disconnects, we will be opportunistic in our share buybacks, returning cash to our shareholders.\nTo that end, our 2023 guidance assumes we offset the impact of stock compensation dilution in 2023 via share repurchase, a practice we had in place prior to 2020.\nOn Slide 14, we provide a bridge of 2023 revenue and operating income guidance as compared to 2022. Starting with revenue. Our growth over market, combined with the decrease in global vehicle production, resulted in a net contribution to revenues of over $1 billion. The full year benefit of direct material cost recoveries will effectively offset changes in index commodity and price downs. FX is estimated at a negative $300 million. And lastly, we expect Wind River and Intercable to contribute approximately $700 million for the year.\nTurning to adjusted operating income. We expect margin expansion of 110 basis points before the benefit of acquisitions, driven by continued strong flow-through on incremental volumes of approximately 30% and the negative impact of price downs, commodities and incremental inflation are partially offset by customer cost recoveries and higher direct labor and other indirect costs are more than offset by increased operating performance including the benefit of cost saving actions, improved manufacturing performance as well as a reduction in supply chain disruption costs, which are estimated to be $180 million in 2023.\nThe addition of Wind River and Intercable will increase 2023 operating income to $2 billion or 10.5%, reflecting margin expansion of 140 basis points and incremental margins of over 27% for the year.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 15 before opening the line up for questions. As the management team reflects on 2022, it's clear that we strengthened our competitive moat and accelerated our commercial momentum, supported by a highly differentiated portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Together with our strong track record of operating execution, Aptiv has never been better positioned to provide our customers with full system solutions that advance the industry's vision of the software-defined vehicle.\nAs a reminder, we're hosting our 2023 Investor Day on February 14 in Boston, where we'll provide our view on the industry and how we plan to usher in the next phase of our business strategy.\nIn closing, I'm proud of what the Aptiv team accomplished during 2022 and have never been more excited about what we will deliver in the years ahead. As you'll see in here on February 14, the best is yet to come.\nOperator, let's now open the line up for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jessica Kourakos, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Kourakos\n\nVP of IR, Environmental, Social & Governance, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Bettina. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q3 financials as well as our full year 2022 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, which reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, including uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3. We had a strong third quarter, so let me touch on a few of the highlights. New business bookings totaled over $5 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to over $25 billion, already outpacing last year's record full year amount of $24 billion, and cementing another record year in 2022.\nRevenue increased 33% to $4.6 billion, representing 9 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, driven by the strength of our safe, green and connected product portfolio.\nWe continue to execute well despite the constrained environment and macro headwinds. EBITDA and earnings per share totaled $673 million and $1.28, respectively, reflecting flow-through on volume growth and material cost recoveries partially offset by costs related to material inflation and supply chain disruptions. We remain on track to reach this year's target of $500 million of material cost recoveries and $100 million of cost reductions, increasing our profitability and enhancing the resiliency of our business model.\nAnd lastly, we continue to invest in growth opportunities as reflected by our agreement to acquire Intercable Automotive Solutions which further strengthens our high-voltage product portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 4. Aptiv's industry-leading portfolio of electrical architecture products and full system-level capabilities, uniquely positions us to optimize vehicle architecture systems. Intercable Automotive is an industry leader in the design and manufacture of high-voltage busbars and interconnect solutions. The company has an outstanding management team that has developed a portfolio of innovative high-voltage power solutions, including their seventh generation busbar product that they've leveraged into very strong relationships with several leading European automotive OEMs.\nThe partnership between Aptiv and Intercable will enhance the strength and breadth of our combined product portfolios, allow Intercable to leverage Aptiv's global scale, manufacturing footprint, especially in North America and China, further strengthen our capabilities to design and deliver fully optimized high-voltage architecture solutions that reduce vehicle weight, mass and costs, and we can leverage these synergies to accelerate the revenue and earnings growth of our combined businesses. We look forward to closing this transaction later this year and welcoming Intercable Automotive to the Aptiv team.\nTurning to Slide 5 to review our segment highlights. Our full system solutions across both the Brain and Nervous System are accelerating the development of the electrified software-defined vehicle of the future. In the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, our portfolio of technologies is helping to increase the penetration of advanced active safety solutions, including a third quarter business award from a major local Chinese OEM for our next-generation ADAS platform, representing our seventh major active safety platform customer.\nIn addition, during the quarter, we secured a high-volume award with a large customer in Asia to provide our next-generation integrated cockpit controller.\nAnd lastly, we continue to build a growing pipeline of software revenue opportunities with an increasing number of North American, European and Asian OEMs, which we're confident will begin to turn into customer awards in 2023 and beyond.\nIn the Signal and Power Solutions segment, as the demand for vehicle electrification continues to accelerate, we're experiencing significant growth in our high-voltage business, which will reach $1.2 billion in revenues this year and accounts for 25% of year-to-date new business awards in the segment.\nIn addition, we continue to successfully leverage our vehicle architecture capabilities to drive revenue diversification and strong growth in the commercial vehicle and nonautomotive markets, which increased 24% during the quarter.\nAnd lastly, our industry-leading position as a full system solution provider of high-voltage architecture, combined with our capabilities in vehicle electronics and software systems has uniquely positioned us to expand our portfolio into power electronic solutions and battery management systems, further broadening our offerings and strengthening our position as the industry leader in vehicle architecture.\nMoving to Slide 6, how we put innovation in motion. During the quarter, Aptiv was named a 2022 PACE Award winner for our Central Vehicle Controller which is scheduled to begin production in 2023 with a major Chinese OEM. This high-performing compute platform is a key piece of the architecture that translates software code into physical action, efficiently and securely controlling the flow of data on and off the vehicle, managing communication for current and emerging high-speed protocols and reducing complexity by up-integrating critical body functions.\nThis particular central vehicle controller is a first-to-market solution and a critical element of our smart vehicle architecture and is essential to enabling the software-defined vehicle. We are increasingly collaborating with our OEM customers to bring these innovative solutions to market as evidenced by our recent participation in the IZB 2022 Conference in Wolfsburg, Germany, where we showcased our portfolio of full system solutions for both hardware and software, to VW CEO, Oliver Blume and his management team pictured here.\nWith Aptiv's Brain and Nervous System capabilities, we're uniquely positioned to reduce complexity through architecture optimization, while enabling the full abstraction of software from hardware. Increasingly important to automotive OEMs, our system-level design capabilities enables breakthrough levels of assembly automation, increasing quality while also reducing complexity and cost.\nAnd as customers migrate to next-generation architectures, capable of supporting software-defined solutions, it's important that they have the right software tools to develop the applications they support. This is why Aptiv is investing in end-to-end cloud native software development tools, which we previewed at IZB and will unveil at CES in 2023.\nFeedback from IZB was overwhelmingly positive, providing an opportunity to increase our level of collaboration with OEM customers and further validating Aptiv as a trusted technology partner.\nTurning to Slide 7 to provide an update on new business awards. As I mentioned, third quarter new business bookings totaled $5.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total of $25.4 billion surpassing our previous full year record, further validation of the strength of our portfolio of advanced technologies and our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings during the quarter totaled $1.4 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $11 billion.\nDriven by the continued strong adoption of advanced active safety solutions, including the new business award I mentioned previously from a major local Chinese OEM for our next-gen ADAS solution, which we will leverage our scalable ADAS platform to support a wide range of advanced safety features.\nBookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment reached $3.7 billion during the quarter, including another strong quarter for high-voltage electrification awards, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $3.5 billion. We've seen a very balanced bookings profile across our high-voltage product offerings, underscoring the strength of our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies.\nAnother strong quarter of new business awards while at the same time successfully negotiating material cost recoveries with our OEM customers is further validation of the uniqueness of our portfolio, the strength of our customer relationships and our flawless operating execution.\nTurning to Slide 8. Despite the constrained environment and macro headwinds, we continue to take actions to increase the underlying resiliency of our business model and deliver sustainable value creation by enhancing our portfolio of full system solutions to increase our addressable content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, recovering increased material input costs and optimizing our cost structure, smartly deploying capital to further strengthen our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers and intelligently diversifying our revenue base into less cyclical nonautomotive markets. We're confident that these actions will position us to continue to create value as the industry transitions to the electrified software-defined vehicle and will be reflected in an acceleration in new business bookings, continued strong revenue growth over market, meaningful margin expansion and strong cash flow generation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to go through the financial highlights in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior VP of Business Operations & CFO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the third quarter financials on Slide 9. As Kevin noted in his opening comments, revenues of $4.6 billion were up 33% with 9 points of growth above underlying vehicle production. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $673 million and $525 million, respectively. EBITDA margins expanded 330 basis points versus third quarter last year and grew 560 basis points sequentially, reflecting flow-through on increased volumes of approximately 32%, both year-over-year and sequentially, continued progress on customer recoveries of direct material inflation, as well as other performance and cost savings actions, partially offset by a return to a more normalized price down environment and the impact of FX, commodities and nonmaterial cost increases.\nEPS in the quarter was $1.28, an increase of over 150% from prior year, reflecting higher net earnings. And operating cash flow totaled $437 million, a significant improvement from the prior year and sequential quarters.\nAs I will discuss in a moment, we will be updating our full year cash flow guidance to reflect the higher expected investment in certain key inventories to help better navigate supply chain constraints and prepare for 2023 launch activities. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $212 million.\nLooking ahead at the third quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Adjusted revenue growth of 33% reflected both our growth over market as well as the rebound in global vehicle production from the prior year, which was heavily impacted by semiconductor shortages. Growth across all regions was led by our key product lines, including high voltage and active safety and reflect some improvement in supply chain conditions. However, despite this relative improvement, we continue to operate in a constrained environment with both direct and indirect impacts on our customers and operations. Direct material inflation recoveries totaled $199 million, and price downs were $64 million, approximately 1.8%.\nThe FX and commodity impact was significant, totaling $226 million, primarily related to the weaker Euro and RMB. Regionally, North American revenues were up 31% or 7% above market as production at several of our larger North American ASUX customers were impacted by supply chain constraints. In Europe, we saw outgrowth of 9%, driven by continued high voltage and active safety growth. And in China, revenues were up 42% or 11 points over market driven in part by a significant increase in launch activity in our Signal and Power segment.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues rose 26% in the period or 2% over market. As previously noted, ASUX experienced lower North American growth over market as several customers experienced supply chain constraints that impacted their vehicle production in the quarter. Excluding these customers, ASUX growth over market was in line with expectations and prior periods.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $122 million or 10.2% of revenues reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes, the previously discussed material cost recoveries, improved operating performance and the benefit of engineering credits. Signal and Power Solutions revenue rose 35% in the period or 11% above market. The outperformance was driven by strength in several product lines, including high voltage.\nSegment EBITDA of $551 million or 16.1% of revenues include strong flow-through on incremental volumes and incremental material cost recoveries, partially offset by the impact of FX and commodities.\nMoving to our full year outlook on Slide 12. Our outlook for revenue, operating margins and EPS remain unchanged from the guidance provided last quarter despite the negative impact of foreign exchange, which has increased significantly since we provided our full year guide. We remain confident that we are well positioned to continue to execute despite the ongoing concerns on supply chain constraints, COVID impacts in China and disruptions in Europe. We expect revenue in the range of $17 billion to $17.3 billion, a growth over market for the year to be within our previously communicated range of 8% to 10%. EBITDA and operating income of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, and earnings per share of $3.30, an increase of 8% over last year, despite a meaningful drag from FX and commodities. We are updating our cash flow guidance, and we now expect to finish the year at $1.35 billion versus the prior guidance of $1.5 billion.\nAs I previously noted, the updated cash flow guidance reflects our decision to carry increased inventory of certain key components to help mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints as we begin to prepare for a number of new customer launches in early 2023.\nBefore turning the call back to Kevin, I wanted to touch briefly on 2023 as we have started the early phases of planning for next year. Although given the ongoing macro challenges, it is too early to provide any specific guidance. However, our strategy remains unchanged, and we continue to be well positioned to lead the transition to higher contented software-enabled vehicles.\nAnd although we expect to benefit from overall demand for key technologies like smart vehicle architecture, high voltage and active safety, the progress we have made on material cost recoveries and operational performance and the inclusion of the Wind River and Intercable acquisitions, we remain cautious of the lingering headwinds and believe continued supply chain tightness and deterioration in economic conditions, particularly in Europe, will negatively impact overall 2023 vehicle production levels as well as the smoothness of vehicle production schedules, making it potentially more challenging to recapture operating leverage. And we would expect the FX commodity headwinds to persist into 2023 as the more meaningful impacts of changes in the euro and RMB did not occur until the second half of this year.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 13 before opening up the call to questions. Our business is built on a strong foundation and continues to gain momentum as we close out 2022 despite the constrained environment and macro headwinds that Joe just touched on. Our strategic alignment with our OEM customers has really never been better as reflected in our continued strong revenue growth over market and the pace of our new business bookings. We continue to make progress recovering the increases in material input costs while also further optimizing our cost structure, and we continue to smartly deploy capital both organically and inorganically to further strengthen our competitive position.\nThese actions have translated into a significant improvement in our margins as evidenced by this quarter's results and are providing momentum and a strong entry point for 2023. As Joe just mentioned, in light of the current macro environment, we'll provide a detailed update on our 2023 outlook when we release fourth quarter earnings, but you can expect us to focus on delivering continued strong revenue growth over market and margin expansion in a challenging environment.\nWith that, we can open up the line for questions."

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jessica Kourakos, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG, you may begin your conference.\n\nJessica Kourakos\n\nVP of IR, Environmental, Social & Governance, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items, and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q2 financials as well as our full year 2022 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, which reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, include uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.\nBeginning on Slide 3. Through the first half of the year, 2 themes stand out; the first is strong broad-based demand across our portfolio of product offerings reflected in over $20 billion in bookings during the first half of 2022, including a record $14 billion in the second quarter alone, almost double where we were at this time last year.\nThe growth in bookings showcases our strong portfolio of technologies and the increasing strategic value we're providing our customers as they transform to meet the consumer demand for the electrified software-defined vehicle. The second theme relates to the persistent COVID and supply chain issues that continue to constrain automotive production impacting our first half revenue growth and our profitability.\nLooking ahead, we believe that these constraints on production and the record levels of inflation will continue for several more quarters and will be addressed with actions that we already have in place. Newer challenges in Europe are being addressed with incremental measures, including another round of customer price increases and increased number of product redesigns further consolidation of our supplier base and additional structural cost reductions, all of which will significantly improve our profitability in the short and long term.\nSetting aside the near-term constraints, I can confidently say that our competitive positioning, reflected in our bookings momentum, has never been stronger and will drive the acceleration of our revenue and earnings growth as vehicle production stabilizes.\nSo we're balancing improving our profitability and cash flow over the short term while continuing to invest in those growth initiatives that will drive more meaningful margin expansion in the years ahead. We'll talk more about these at our upcoming Investor Day in Boston on February 14. By then, our 2022 results and 2023 guidance will be out, and we can update investors on our strategy to enable the fully electrified software-defined vehicle of the future and how that will accelerate profitable growth and improve through-cycle resiliency in the years ahead.\nLet's now turn to our second quarter results. Revenues totaled $4.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by strong demand across our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $213 million and $0.22, respectively, reflecting strong revenue growth, more than offset by material inflation, incremental costs related to supply chain disruptions, shutdowns in China and some softening in vehicle production schedules in Europe.\nTurning to Slide 4. Revenue grew 8 points over underlying vehicle production, which increased 1% in the quarter. North America production remained strong while Europe experienced significant weakness from a combination of semiconductor chip supply and macroeconomic factors. China had a very strong finish to the second quarter despite a slow start due to COVID-related production disruptions.\nWhile our team is doing an excellent job keeping production going in this very volatile environment, the challenges we're facing continue to have a meaningful impact on our business. With supply chain disruptions and persistent inflation continuing to translate into incremental costs, and the increased likelihood of disruption of the gas supply into Europe, we've accelerated several initiatives to increase our agility and resiliency and improve our profitability in the near term.\nMoving to Slide 5. The tremendous customer pull for our products has positioned us well in our pricing discussions for both new program awards as well as cost recoveries. The pricing on new business bookings support our long-term margin framework. And as these bookings move into production, they will naturally improve our margin profile. Over the near term, cost recoveries we've already negotiated with customers, and are coming in above plan, will have a more significant impact on second half profitability.\nFor context, the timing of cost recoveries for semiconductor broker buys negatively impacted ASUX margins by 300 basis points in the second quarter but will benefit our results in the second half of the year and going -- second half of the year. Going forward, all future premiums will be passed on to customers at the time of the transaction.\nWe continue to validate more second sources on key components and are passing through increased input costs to improve profitability. In addition, we're implementing additional overhead cost reductions and further rationalizing our footprint, which we expect to yield $100 million in savings in 2023.\nWe've also been working on several product redesign initiatives to both increase our sourcing flexibility and mitigate the impact of inflation. The benefits from these redesign initiatives will accelerate during late 2022 and into 2023. We believe the current macro headwinds will elongate the automotive growth cycle.\nSo we're further optimizing our cost structure to position us for success in both the short and the long term. That means executing these cost reduction actions, while still preserving investments in our highest growth opportunities, including high-voltage electrification, active safety and smart vehicle architecture as well as our product redesign and validation initiatives that are important for increased resiliency and improve profitability.\nLastly, we're also excited about our software strategy and the many opportunities we see with the acquisition of Wind River. In summary, the resiliency of our business model has put us in a strong competitive position to capitalize on the mega trends of safe, green and connected.\nTurning to Slide 6. As reflected in the momentum of our new business bookings, Aptiv is clearly gaining a lot of traction. Our unique position as the only provider of both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle has translated into significant -- to a significant competitive mode, allowing Aptiv to provide full system-level end-to-end solutions that enable an efficient path to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle.\nOur full vehicle -- our full system level solutions and capabilities optimizing vehicle architecture and allow for reduced vehicle complexity, flexible and scalable platforms, improve quality, reliability and performance and translates into significant weight, mass and cost savings.\nThey also accelerate the vehicle development efforts of our customers, positioning us to launch the first-to-market zone controller with Volvo early next year. Our Smart Vehicle Architecture solution not only creates accretive value for Aptiv but also lowers total systems cost for our customers, enabling more vehicle automation and the seamless integration of new features and functionality.\nThe recognition of the need for smart vehicle architecture is accelerating and is reflected in the 20 engagements with 10 customers and almost $5 billion of new business bookings today, demonstrating how Aptiv is uniquely positioned to lead the industry to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle.\nMoving to Slide 7. The momentum of our new business bookings during the first half of the year gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth at or above our long-term margin framework across both of our business segments. Second quarter bookings totaled $14.2 billion, a record for any quarter in the company's history.\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled a record $8.8 billion during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $9.6 billion, also a record for the full year, even though we're just halfway through 2022.\nAs we discussed on the previous slide, we continue to make significant commercial progress on our smart vehicle architecture solution. The advanced development programs we've been involved in are translating into new business awards as evidenced by the large advanced zone controller booking during the quarter from a leading German OEM, in addition to the central vehicle control award we received in the first quarter from the same customer.\nWe're extremely excited about our continued deep strategic partnership with this customer as we redefine vehicle architecture with the full adoption of our SVA solution. Bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment reached $5.4 billion during the quarter, including another strong quarter for a high-voltage product line with $1 billion in customer awards, bringing the year-to-date total to over $2 billion.\nOur bookings momentum validates the value we bring with our system-level approach to optimizing vehicle architecture, which reduces vehicle weight and mass, thereby reducing costs for OEM customers. It is also a testament to our strong customer relationships, our One Aptiv approach and our portfolio of advanced technologies which is perfectly aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends.\nI'm truly proud of the work the team has done to continue to build strong relationships with our customers as a partner of choice for both the brain and the nervous system of the vehicle. Turning to Slide 8 in our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment.\nActive Safety revenue growth remained strong, up 21% during the quarter, driven by the continued penetration of advanced ADAS systems partially offset by semiconductor shortages impacting production in Europe and North America, and user experience revenues were down 6% in the quarter, primarily the result of continued chip supply constraints in Europe and the impact of China shutdowns on volume, but we expect to finish the year with approximately 10% revenue growth.\nAs mentioned, we continue to experience increased demand for smart vehicle architecture and see a very strong pipeline of customer activity for the remainder of this year and into 2023. We've leveraged our competitive position to enter into strategic dialogues with several OEMs on redesigning their software architecture in addition to optimizing their vehicle architecture.\nWe offer unique capabilities to modernize software development and deployment to help our customers migrate to the software-defined vehicles of the future, which unlocks additional opportunities to further enhance the value of Aptiv's and our customers' software solutions. Active safety also continues to show strong momentum with more than $4 billion of awards in the quarter, including just under a $3 billion award with a global OEM for their next-gen Level 2, Level 3 ADAS system, reinforcing our leading position as the ADAS supplier of choice for this customer.\nMoving to Slide 9. Second quarter revenues in our Signal and Power Solutions segment rose 10%, 9 points better than global vehicle production, reflecting high-voltage revenues that increased 22% during the quarter, driven by the launch of new electric vehicle programs, particularly in Asia and North America.\nAnd revenues in nonautomotive markets that increased 14%, the result of strong growth in general industrial, semiconductor, datacom and commercial space markets. Our industry-leading portfolio of power and data distribution, connectors, electrical centers and cable management solutions, combined with our global scale uniquely positions Aptiv to both design and manufacture optimized vehicle architecture systems for customers located anywhere in the world.\nIn the quarter, we were awarded a high-voltage architectural award with a major European OEM, positioning us for substantial growth for this customer as they increase their electrification offerings over the next several years. The strength of our competitive position and the size of our funnel for new programs gives us confidence in reaching over $4 billion of high-voltage electrification new business bookings during 2022.\nMoving to Slide 10. We continue to execute on our plan to build a business that delivers outsized results in any market. We have the right safe, green and connected product portfolio, the right regional and customer mix, the right cost structure and track record of execution and the financial flexibility that translates into a more resilient business model.\nWe'd hope COVID, it's associated supply chain constraints and production disruptions would be in the rearview mirror by now, and that we'd be experiencing steady economic growth, but macro headwinds and other challenges do remain. While these may persist for several more quarters, we expect to end the year with strong growth while also expanding margins.\nAnd I'm confident we've taken appropriate actions that will allow us to finish the year on a strong footing with an even more resilient business model. Any improvement in the macros or the supply chain will present potential upside from here.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to go through the financial highlights in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior VP of Business Operations & CFO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the second quarter financials on Slide 11. As Kevin highlighted, the business reported another quarter of strong growth over market despite the difficult operating environment. Revenues of $4.1 billion were up 9% with 8 points of growth above underlying vehicle production despite the prolonged COVID shutdowns in China.\nThe China shutdowns, which disproportionately impacted our Shanghai base customers, negatively impacted our growth over market by approximately 1% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $365 million and $213 million, respectively, reflecting flow-through on incremental volumes and positive price in the quarter offset by an increase in supply chain disruption costs related to the China shutdowns as well as higher levels of material inflation.\nAnd the negative impact from FX and commodities, primarily related to the lower euro and changes in copper prices. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.22, reflecting lower operating income levels while the EPS impact of higher interest costs was substantially offset by tax favorability.\nThe equity income loss at Motional had a $0.26 negative impact. Lastly, operating cash flow was $95 million with capital expenditures increasing $80 million year-over-year to $207 million for the quarter.\nLooking at the second quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 12. Increased volume was driven by strong growth over market across all regions. Pricing activity in the quarter was positive as we continue to make progress, recovering higher input costs from our customers and as noted, FX and commodity movements were net negative to revenue as compared to the prior year.\nFrom a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 21%, representing 9 points of growth over market, driven by continued strength in our active safety product line and our Signal and Power segment. In Europe, we saw outgrowth of 9% as our active safety and high-voltage product lines continue to benefit from strong demand.\nHowever, during the quarter, we did start to see decreases in European production schedules resulting from what we believe is a combination of supply chain constraints around semiconductors and macroeconomic concerns.\nAs I will discuss in a moment, we have also seen a reduction in European customer schedules heading into the second half of the year. In China, revenues decreased 1.9% as a result of the shutdowns. However, we grew 7 points above the market, reflecting the strength of our underlying product portfolio as well as the resiliency of our Chinese operations.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues rose 7% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production. This includes growth in active safety, where revenues were up 21% despite the semiconductor supply shortages driven by program ramps in North America and Europe. User experience was down for the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the China shutdowns and semiconductor constraints on certain larger programs. As we have previously discussed, the increases in semiconductor costs have significantly impacted the segment's profitability.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $14 million, down $54 million compared to Q2 of last year. Volume growth contributed approximately $18 million of incremental earnings, representing a flow-through of 33% and price was a positive 1.1% versus prior year, offset by increased material input costs.\nSignal and Power Solutions revenues were up 10%, representing 9% growth over market. The market outperformance was driven by continued strength in several product lines, including high-voltage and engineered components. Also, our nonautomotive product lines, including commercial vehicle, saw a revenue growth of 14% for the quarter.\nEBITDA in the segment was down $79 million in the quarter as flow-through on volume growth and the impact of positive pricing in the quarter were offset by higher disruption costs, the impact of FX and commodities and inflation.\nTurning now to Slide 14 and our updated 2022 macro outlook. We have lowered our estimate for global vehicle production to 81.5 million units on an active weighted basis, an increase of 3% over 2021. The reduction of approximately 1.6 million units from our prior estimate primarily reflects decreases in second half customer schedules in Europe.\nSmaller movements in North America and China schedules substantially offset and do not have a significant impact on our outlook. We believe scheduled reductions in Europe reflect both macroeconomic concerns as well as to strengths resulting from semiconductor availability. Although overall supply chain constraints have eased and second half European production is up year-over-year, subcomponent availability is a limiting factor on the pace of vehicle production ramps.\nWe would note that our European production estimate does not reflect any prolonged industry shutdowns related to energy or natural gas conservation actions. We understand that there are contingency plans within Europe to slow or stop manufacturing operations for set periods of time, should there be a need to increase energy conservation heading into the winter.\nTo date, we have not received any direct communication from our customers regarding planned shutdowns and have not seen such actions reflect in customer schedules. In addition, our resiliency teams are taking proactive steps to help mitigate the potential impact on our operations and supply chain from potential shutdown of Aptiv's European manufacturing sites and supply base.\nSlide 15 summarizes our updated 2022 outlook, which excludes the impact of the Wind River acquisition. In addition to the changes in European vehicle production, we have increased our estimate of the total price recovery we expect to receive in 2022 by $260 million, bringing the full year recovery to approximately $500 million.\nWe've also updated our outlook for the lower euro and copper price, both of which are down significantly from the original guidance. As a result, we now expect revenue in the range of $17 billion to $17.3 billion, EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint.\nWe estimate adjusted earnings per share to be $3.30. This estimate includes the impact of the Wind River financing completed in February but excludes the Wind River acquisition itself. And we expect 2022 operating cash flow to be approximately $1.5 billion with CapEx continuing to be roughly 5% of sales.\nSlide 16 bridges our prior guidance to the current outlook. Starting with revenue. We have already discussed the progress we are making with price recoveries, offset by lower production volume of $505 million, the majority of which reflects the European scheduled reductions we previously discussed, partially offset by our growth over market.\nIn addition, we are working plans to exit our Russian joint venture and have appropriately reflected this business as held for sale into U.S. GAAP. Our original guidance included revenues of approximately $75 million for the JV. The weaker euro and lower copper pricing represent another $480 million headwind to revenues. And as noted on the slide, this assumption is based on the euro at parity and a $3.40 copper price.\nTurning to adjusted operating income. The incremental price recovery effectively offsets the material cost inflation for the full year. And although further input cost increases are possible, we remain committed to offsetting such costs with additional customer price increases.\nThe decremental flow through on the near-term schedule [revisions] of approximately 40% is consistent with prior short-term production slowdowns. And although significant to the revenue line, the FX and commodity moves have a relatively small impact on earnings.\nLastly, we have included incremental supply chain disruption costs to our revised outlook, including the $30 million incurred in China in the second quarter.\nAs Kevin noted, we have taken cost reduction actions that have an annualized benefit of $100 million and start to take effect in the second half of this year. In summary, although negatively impacted by vehicle production, other macro factors and supply chain constraints, we continue to drive strong top line growth and improved performance, with revenues of $17.15 billion, up 13% from 2021, operating income growth of 16% with 50 basis points of margin expansion, EPS growth of 8% and operating cash flow growth of 25%.\nMoving to Slide 17. We wanted to finish with a comparison of our first half to second half performance. Despite the difficult operating environment, forecasted vehicle production is higher in the second half of the year, and our leading technology portfolio will allow us to continue to drive growth over market.\nFlow-through on price recovery is higher in the second half of the year, result of settlement timing with certain customers. The FX and commodity impact reflects the previously discussed changes in the euro and the copper pricing, and we expect strong performance primarily resulting from the improvement in supply chain disruption costs versus the first half and the benefit of certain cost savings actions that begin to take effect in Q3.\nConsistent with prior years, the second half operating margin is not indicative of a full year run rate as the fourth quarter is historically stronger given the timing of certain customer reimbursements and some regional trends. In addition, as noted, certain price recovery and cost-saving actions are higher in the second half versus a normalized annual run rate.\nFor 2022, we would estimate the discrete second half benefit totals approximately $150 million, implying a more normalized operating margin rate of 10% to 10.5%.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 18. I'm happy with the bookings momentum, which will yield strong profitable growth in the years to come. We have work to do, but we're making a lot of progress on several initiatives that will improve both earnings and cash flow in the near and long term.\nAs Joe discussed, we're further optimizing our cost structure, increasing prices to offset inflation and attacking anything else that we can control or we can influence. I'm confident these actions will translate into a significant improvement in second half margins and cash flow and provide a solid action point as we move into 2023.\nMore details around the progress on these initiatives will be presented when we provide 2023 guidance. But we clearly expect meaningful improvements in profitability during the coming months on relatively low vehicle production assumptions.\nThanks, again, for your time, and let's open up the line for Q&A."

My name is Marion, and I'll be your conference operator today. (Operator Instructions) Chris Tillett, Aptiv's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Paul Tillett\n\nDirector of IR, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Marion. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found at the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com.\nToday's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items, and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q1 financials as well as our full year 2022 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information which reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filing, including uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nChairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.\nBeginning on Slide 3. Aptiv had a solid start to the year, showcasing our ability to continue to outperform in a volatile market. Revenues totaled $4.2 billion, up 4% from the prior year, driven by strong demand across our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $324 million and $0.63, respectively, reflecting continued revenue growth despite a decline in vehicle production in the quarter, more than offset by material inflation and increased operating costs associated with the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Highlights for the quarter include 11 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, with all regions reporting strong growth over market, driven by continued growth in our key product line, which I'll touch on in more detail on the next slide. New business bookings reached $6.1 billion, the result of growing demand for our portfolio of industry-leading advanced technologies. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related supply chain challenges, Aptiv's business has not been immune to the effects of the various disruptions. We continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, which will impact the balance of the year. But at this point in time, we remain confident in our full year outlook. Our team is doing an exceptional job executing in a very fluid environment, working to mitigate the challenges we're facing. And our sustainable double-digit growth over market and pace of new business bookings during the quarter are a testament to our ability to continue to deliver for our customers.\nTurning to Slide 4. Revenue growth across our key product lines continue to outpace the market. In our ASUX segment, Aptiv safety revenue growth remained strong, up 9% during the quarter, driven by the continued penetration of advanced ADAS systems. And user experience revenues increased 10%, the result of the launch of key infotainment programs in Europe and North America.\nIn our Signal and Power Solutions segment, high-voltage revenues increased 10% during the quarter, driven by the accelerated launch of electric vehicle programs, particularly in Asia and Europe. And our nonautomotive revenues, which now represent roughly 15% of Aptiv's sales, increased 5%, the result of strong growth in the general industrial, semiconductor and datacom markets. Our portfolio of advanced technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends has uniquely positioned Aptiv to solve our customers' biggest challenges, which we've capitalized on to increase our market share with new customers and expand our share of wallet with existing customers.\nMoving to Slide 5. Consumer demand remains very strong, requiring us to proactively manage through the ongoing supply chain disruptions while also offsetting the increased material inflation. As I mentioned already, our team is doing an excellent job confronting these issues head on and have taken several actions to offset the headwinds related to macro factors, including further reducing overhead costs, while selectively investing in initiatives related to high-voltage electrification, smart vehicle architecture and software development. Our recently announced agreement to acquire Wind River, which we expect to close midyear, has translated into several direct OEM engagements, including the commercial agreement with Hyundai that was announced earlier this week. We're also working closely with our supplier partners and our customers and several product redesign initiatives to both mitigate part shortages and offset material price increases, over [50%] of which have and roughly another 50% will be implemented during the balance of the year. And lastly, we're making progress on other cost recovery initiatives, including price reductions from our suppliers and commercial recoveries from our customers, which have a more meaningful impact during the back half of the year.\nWe continue to confront the supply chain and inflation challenges and are focused on strengthening the underlying resiliency of our business model and reaping the full benefits once these headwinds subside.\nAs shown on Slide 6, first quarter bookings totaled $6.1 billion, the highest first quarter level over the last several years. Advanced safety and user experience bookings totaled $800 million for the quarter, in line with our expectations, representing the timing of customer program awards during the year. Notable customer awards during the quarter include a central vehicle controller for a European OEM. A funnel for new business bookings for the ASUX segment for the balance of the year remains very strong, with several ADAS user experience and smart vehicle architecture program scheduled to be awarded. And the second quarter is off to a strong start, with over $3 billion of ADAS awards and a central vehicle control award with lifetime revenues totaling $1.5 billion.\nBookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment reached $5.3 billion during the quarter, including $1.2 billion in high-voltage electrification award. The strength of our competitive position and the size of our funnel for high-voltage electrification programs gives us confidence in reaching over $4 billion of customer awards during 2022. Our strong track record of new business bookings is proof that our portfolio of advanced technologies is perfectly aligned to the areas of significant growth in vehicle content. And our unique position as the only provider of both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle is presenting Aptiv with opportunities to capitalize on the acceleration towards the electrified software-defined vehicle.\nTurning to the highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 7. Revenues for the first quarter increased 7%, 14 points over underlying vehicle production, driven by strong product line growth in both active safety and user experience. As I referenced on the last slide, during the first quarter, we received a new business award from a leading German OEM for a central vehicle controller on the next wave of its leading EV platform. This award is another strategic win for our portfolio of smart vehicle architecture solution and is a key building block for this OEM's new electric vehicle platform, which is fully aligned with Aptiv's design for smart vehicle architecture.\nMoving to Slide 8. First quarter revenues in our Signal and Power Solutions segment rose 2%, 9 points better than the decline in global vehicle production, reflecting increased demand for high-voltage architecture solutions and continued strong revenue growth in nonautomotive markets. Our industry-leading portfolio of power and data distribution, connectors, electrical centers and cable management solution, combined with our global scale, uniquely positions Aptiv to both design and manufacture optimized vehicle architecture systems for customers located virtually anywhere in the world. And as a proof point, a leading global electric vehicle OEM awarded Aptiv an additional vehicle architecture program to support their further expansion into Europe. In addition, we continue to support the growth of a German OEM's electric vehicle platform. And the award of this charging device underscores our strong market position in electric vehicle charging.\nThe first quarter's new business bookings validates the value we bring with our system-level approach to optimizing vehicle architecture, which reduces vehicle weight and mass, thereby reducing costs for our OEM customer. We remain confident that our competitive position, combined with the accelerating demand for electrified vehicles, positions Aptiv for profitable growth in the Signal and Power Solutions segment for the next several years.\nTurning to Slide 9. Despite the current challenges, we remain focused on increasing the underlying resiliency of our business model to deliver sustainable value creation. Although the macro environment remains very challenging and difficult to navigate, we continue to focus on increasing the flexibility of our operating model by leveraging our advanced technologies for both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle, providing more content for the software-defined vehicles of the future, deploying capital to further strengthen our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies, including expanding our portfolio of software solutions, to meet the increasing needs of our customers and intelligently diversifying our revenue base into less cyclical nonautomotive markets, which will better position Aptiv for value creation from the acceleration of the trend towards the fully electrified software-defined vehicle, increased market share gains, and continued operational efficiency and cost structure optimization. This translates into revenue growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation, which can be reinvested in the business to create an even more resilient business model.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joe, to go through the financial highlights in more detail.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior VP of Business Operations & CFO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.\nStarting with a recap of the quarter on Slide 10. The business generated strong top line performance while successfully navigating through several industry-wide operating challenges. Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 4%, 11% ahead of vehicle production, which was down 7% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $478 million and $324 million, respectively, reflecting strong flow-through on higher volumes and the benefit of savings and cost reduction actions, price downs that were effectively flat year-over-year and the negative impact of supply chain disruption costs, FX and commodities and material inflation. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.63. Lastly, we had operating cash flows -- outflows of $202 million, driven primarily by our decision to maintain a higher working capital investment to help, in part, mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. Capital expenditures were $247 million, driven by investments to support program launches across our key product lines.\nLooking at the first quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 11. We saw growth over market in all regions despite production disruptions in Europe, in the Russia-Ukrainian war, as well as COVID-related shutdowns in China, which impacted the final weeks of the quarter. The FX commodity impact on the top line was minimal as the pass-through of the higher copper prices for our customers offset the impact of the lower [euro]. As I previously noted, the negative impact of price downs was minimal, almost flat on a year-over-year basis. From a regional perspective, North America revenue was up 7% on an adjusted basis or 8% above vehicle production, driven by our active safety, high-voltage and nonautomotive product line. European growth was -- European growth above market was 13% despite a contraction in vehicle production of 18% in the quarter, led by strength in our active safety and high-voltage product lines as well as the launch of several user experience programs. And lastly, in China, revenues were up 14% over a flat market as both segments posted strong double-digit growth despite the impact of COVID disruptions in late March.\nMoving to the segment recap on Slide 12. The Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 7% in the quarter, reflecting 14% growth over underlying vehicle production, including growth in both active safety and user experience. As we have discussed, the increase in material input costs, primarily semiconductors, has negatively impacted segment profitability. Segment adjusted operating income was $16 million in the quarter, down $52 million compared to Q1 of last year. Volume growth contributed approximately $25 million of adjusted OI in the period, reflecting flow-through of 35%. And annual price downs were effectively flat to prior year. A reduction in supply chain disruption costs and the benefit of higher performance and cost actions partially offset the impact of the previously mentioned material inflation.\nWe are actively pursuing multiple paths to mitigate and/or offset the material inflation cost impacting ASUX. In addition to commercial and pricing negotiations with our customers, we are also pursuing product engineering and redesign. A number of these activities involve a redesign of products to open up multiple supplier sourcing opportunities, primarily as it relates to semiconductors, including the sourcing of semiconductors from newer market entrants in all regions where we operate.\nSignal and Power Solution revenues were up 2%, reflecting 9 points of growth over market, with meaningful outgrowth in all regions. We continue to see strength in high voltage as well as our engineered components product lines. And the segment's reported growth comes despite a difficult year-over-year comparison given the H1 2021 distribution channel replenishment we discussed last year.\nAdjusted operating income in the segment was down $98 million as the flow-through on incremental volumes and the benefits of improved performance and cost-saving actions were offset by COVID and supply chain disruption costs, as well as the impact of FX, commodity and material inflation, primarily copper pass-through timing and resins.\nThe full year outlook included on Slide 13 remains unchanged from our original guidance provided in February. As noted in February, the full year outlook excludes Wind River, as that transaction is expected to close midyear. We expect the Wind River transaction to be neutral to 2022 earnings per share. We believe the material inflation and continued supply chain constraints were substantially addressed in our original guidance. And although we are seeing current year increases to material costs, the actions we are taking with our customers, supply base and cost structure are helping to offset the impact of these additional increases. As it relates to the more recent 2022 disruptions, we believe the second quarter will be significantly impacted by the COVID-related lockdowns in China. We are not providing a formal guide for the second quarter. However, we do believe it is possible that the second quarter is at or slightly below the first quarter revenue and earnings levels.\nAs it relates to China, assuming the COVID-related lockdowns eased during the second quarter, we currently expect that market to recover lost vehicle production in the second half of the year. With respect to Europe, as we have previously discussed, we have mitigated our direct production exposure to Ukraine. And barring a broadening of the conflict, we do not expect our other European production facilities to be impacted. Although we have seen softening in European vehicle production to date, we believe that lost production will either be rescheduled for later in the year in Europe and/or offset by stronger North American production.\nAccordingly, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $17.75 billion to $18.15 billion, up 15% at the midpoint compared to 2021. This assumes global vehicle production growth of approximately 6%, with some shifting between regions from our original forecast. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at the midpoint. We continue to estimate adjusted earnings per share to be $4.35 for 2022, an increase of 42% over the comparable 2021 total. And we expect 2022 operating cash flows to be just over $2 billion, with CapEx at approximately 5% of sales.\nMoving to Slide 14. Before I turn the call back to Kevin, we have received several questions recently regarding the long-term 2022 forecast we provided at our 2019 Investor Day. And we thought it would be helpful to lay out the changes relative to where we are today. As you may recall, our long-term forecast provided in 2019 estimated 2022 revenues of $17.5 billion, a 14.2% adjusted operating margin and assumed global vehicle production of approximately 98 million units. When adjusting for current vehicle production of 83 million units, the forecast would now be $15.2 billion of revenue, with an operating margin of 12.6%. Growth over market contribution was significantly higher than our 2019 forecast, driven by the strength of our key product lines, offsetting about 70% of the impact from the decrease in vehicle production. The combination of price, performance, labor economics and investment are also favorable to the original long-term forecast. As a result, after adjusting for the change in global vehicle production, the combined impact of COVID and supply chain disruption costs and recent material inflation total the difference between our current outlook and the prior long-term forecast for 2022.\nWhile we are proud of our disciplined revenue growth and operating performance over the past several years, we understand the importance of long-term margin expansion. We are confident that the COVID and supply chain disruption costs, currently estimated approximately $250 million, will abate as conditions normalize. And as we have discussed, we are laser focused on developing offsets and mitigating the impact of material inflation over the next couple of years. In addition, we believe Aptiv's underlying cost structure is well situated to drive incremental margins from the recovery in global vehicle production over the coming years.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nChairman & CEO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 15 before we open up for questions. Our commercial momentum is stronger than ever as we're able to leverage our unique brain and nervous system portfolio of advanced technologies to accelerate our customers' path to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle of the future. We continue to closely monitor the current macros, including supply chain disruptions and material inflation, as well as the more recent war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Our team is doing an excellent job executing in this challenging environment, keeping our customers' product -- production lines connected, while at the same time, implementing initiatives to optimize our cost structure to help offset the macro headwinds, all while we continue to invest in the development of advanced technologies, which we're confident will further enhance our competitive position and increase the resiliency of our business model.\nThanks again for your time, and let's open up the line for Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Chris Tilles, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Aptiv's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Aptiv. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q4 and full year financials, as well as for our full year 2022 outlook, are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release.\nDuring today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, which reflect Aptiv's current view of future financial performance and may be materially different from our actual performance for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, including uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty in predicting its future course and impact on the supply chain and global economy.\nJoining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's President and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results and 2022 outlook in more detail before we open the call to Q&A.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3, during 2021, we experienced record growth over market and record new business bookings driven by our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends, as well as our success keeping our customers running through the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Despite the increased efforts to keep our customers connected, our financial results validate the strength of our competitive position and the resiliency of our business model.\nFocusing on the highlights for the full year, new business bookings reached 24 billion and revenues totaled 15.6 billion, representing 15% growth, 15 points over underlying vehicle production. Operating income and earnings per share totaled 1.2 billion and 2 61, respectively, reflecting the benefit of strong revenue growth, partially offset by increased operating expenses related to supply chain disruptions and material cost inflation, which Joe will cover in greater detail in a few minutes.\nLastly, we continue to invest in organic growth initiatives. And as you know, recently announced an agreement to acquire Wind River, a leading provider of intelligent had software solutions representing 1 more step in accelerating the intelligent transformation of Aptiv and positioning us to enable the software-defined future. This transaction uniquely positions Aptiv to provide comprehensive solutions that enable software to be developed faster, deployed more seamlessly and optimize throughout the vehicle life cycle.\nSetting the supply chain challenges aside, the Aptiv team is executing exceptionally well, continuing to proactively position the company for the future, increasing the efficiency of our underlying cost structure while investing in high-growth, high-margin advanced technologies that increase the resiliency of our business model, which will lead to a stronger competitive position and increase value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 4. As I already mentioned, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategy and further enhancing our industry-leading capabilities. The macro headwinds we faced over the past 2 years have validated the resiliency of our business model, showcased by the false execution of new program launches as well as the record new business bookings and record revenue growth over market. Looking ahead, Aptiv will be even better positioned to capitalize on the safe, green and connected megatrends, just as a path to the software-defined vehicles accelerating. Our scalable advanced ADAS and in-cabin sensing solutions increased system performance while lowering cost, enabling the democratization of active safety features. Our extensive portfolio of both low-voltage and high-voltage electrification solutions allows us to develop optimized vehicle architectures that significantly reduce vehicle weight and mass and lower overall vehicle cost.\nAnd our vehicle connectivity solutions provide our OEMs with the data analytics and insights that allow for continuous enhancements through the vehicle life cycle and our fleet customers with the vehicle health data to minimize vehicle downtime. Collectively, each of these offerings is a key foundational element for our Smart Vehicle Architecture solution, and 2021 was a proof point for the market relevancy of our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies, which gives us the confidence to increase our framework for revenue growth to 8 to 10 points over vehicle production.\nAs shown on Slide 5, 2021 new business bookings totaled a record $24 billion, a $6 billion increase over the COVID impacted 2020 amount and a $2 billion increase over the previous record of $22 billion. Our unique portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies, combined with our FAS operating execution continues to position Aptiv as a partner of choice for our customers. Advanced Safety and User Experience segment bookings totaled $6 billion for the year, including $2.8 billion in active safety awards. Bookings for our Signal & Power Solutions segment reached $18 billion, including a record $3.5 billion of high-voltage electrification awards. The cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years across our portfolio of advanced technologies, gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, further validating the resiliency of our business model.\nTurning to the highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 6. Revenues for the fourth quarter declined 1%, 15 points better than the reduction in global vehicle production. For the full year, revenues increased 13%, 13 points over vehicle production, reflecting the benefit of new program launches and increased penetration rates which resulted in strong growth over market in our active safety product line and continued strong growth in our user experience and connectivity and security product lines, driven by the launch of infotainment programs in Europe, and in-cabin sensing programs in both North America and Europe. As the demand increases for more advanced active safety and user experience features, the need for more advanced software development, integration and compute capabilities is required. And our industry-leading capabilities presents us with additional market share opportunities as evidenced by a new business award from Stellantis for an ADAS satellite architecture solution on the Ram pickup truck, building off of our earlier success launching a similar scalable active safety solution on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer. Several new business awards from Ford for the extension of our ADAS satellite architecture solutions across additional new vehicle platforms. Awards from Volvo for the extension of the first-of-its-kind Android infotainment solution, powered by native Google Automotive Services with real-time OTA onto new additional vehicle platforms. And lastly, further commercial validation of our smart vehicle architecture solution in China, with a new business award from Baidu for the development of a central vehicle controller.\nThis high-performance compute platform will launch in 2023 on a vehicle produced by the (inaudible) joint venture, GD. -- and we'll up-integrate central body functions and control the flow of data in and out of the vehicle.\nMoving to Slide 7, fourth quarter revenues in our Signal & Power Solutions segment declined 6%, 10 points better than the decline in global vehicle production. For the full year, revenues increased 16%, 16 points over vehicle production, reflecting the increased production of high-voltage electrified vehicles resulting in increased demand for both our low-voltage and high-voltage architecture solutions from traditional and emerging electric vehicle OEMs and continued strong demand from engineered components for both automotive and nonautomotive applications.\nWe're perfectly positioned to support our customers globally with an industry-leading portfolio of high-voltage distribution, connection and cable management solutions, which has translated into a significant increase in new business awards for high-voltage solutions, including an award for Rivian for low-voltage content on the electrified R1S and R1T models, an extension of our 2019 award on these vehicles. An award for high-voltage vehicle architecture covering several next-generation Stellantis vehicles, an important win is more European platforms migrate to full battery electric vehicles. High-voltage architecture awards with VW for additional ID models on their MEV platform, building off several high-voltage bookings on the MEV platform in 2020. And lastly, an award from a major North American OEM for a wireless charging solution that will launch on several of their vehicle platforms.\nThese new business awards validate our leadership position in optimizing high-voltage power distribution for new vehicle architectures that deliver value for our customers. We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification driven by both more stringent CO2 regulations and the increasing momentum for consumer acceptance. The fact that we have content on more than 50% of the battery electric vehicles launching over the next few years, we're confident that we will continue to experience very strong revenue growth from our high-voltage electrification product line.\nTurning to Slide 8, as I mentioned, in early January, we announced the agreement to acquire Wind River, a global leader in intelligent edge connected systems. This acquisition reflects our commitment to accelerating Aptiv's software strategy. Together, we'll be able to provide a comprehensive edge-to-cloud software solutions spanning the full intelligence system life cycle across multiple industries. Our complementary software offerings will create new growth and value creation opportunities for Aptiv and our customers through a cloud-native platform that enables the development, deployment and operation of software across the full vehicle life cycle. A smart vehicle architecture enables the evolution of vehicle architecture and advanced feature adoption across domains. Wind River's proven solutions for mission-critical applications will play a key role in enabling the software-defined vehicle.\nSlide 9 provides an overview of our software strategy. We're at a tipping point in the automotive industry's transition to the software-defined vehicle. Consumers are demanding more advanced features for vehicle safety, comfort and convenience. 5G in the cloud are creating opportunities to deliver vehicles that leverage connectivity and lower battery costs are accelerating the penetration of high-voltage electrification, all of which is enabled through a significant increase in the amount of software content in the vehicle, growing from $30 billion today to $90 billion by 2030.\nOEMs are beginning to separate software from the underlying hardware, both technically as they transition to smart vehicle architectures and then how they're sourcing new programs. Aptiv is enabling OEMs to accelerate their transition to an electrified software-defined vehicle, by employing a more holistic engineering and development approach to optimize the hardware, the software and the system solution that spans the full vehicle stack. Our industry-leading position in the development of high-performance, cost-optimized, automotive-grade hardware and deep software development capabilities deployed across millions of vehicles with multiple OEMs across the globe gives us confidence in our unique competitive position.\nThe combined expertise and complementary technologies of Aptiv and Wind River further augmented with TT Tech's deterministic framework that enhances active safety software applications are uniquely positioned to assist OEMs in cost effectively accelerating the development and the deployment of the software-defined vehicle. Aptiv Smart Vehicle Architecture solution optimizes the vehicle infrastructure while providing the necessary network redundancy and resiliency. Wind River's Studio Cloud Native platform allows for the development, deployment, operation and servicing the fecal software stack, shortening development cycles, speeding time to market and enabling full life cycle management. And an open development environment allows for future adoption and development from multiple sources, including Aptiv's active safety and user experience software as well as OEM developed software.\nIn short, our strategy continues to be focused on accelerating the transition to the software-defined vehicle by offering a complete stack from high-performance hardware to cloud connectivity that enables value-added services; a software architecture that is open, that's scalable and containerized, easily upgradable in providing OEMs with the flexibility to efficiently integrate their own as well as other software and future development, and that can be continuously certified for safety critical applications and providing full life cycle management capabilities that enable attractive new business models.\nMoving to Slide 10, some of the advanced technologies we've discussed were on display at this year's CES event in Las Vegas. Outside the Pavilion, we showed a number of feature-rich vehicles with Aptiv vehicle architecture, active safety and user experience content already on board. Inside the Pavilion, we featured a fully functioning spare vehicle architecture and continuous delivery platform. We hosted over 400 customers, both in-person and virtually from over 50 companies, including 25 OEMs. This year's CES event provided our customers with the opportunity to validate Aptiv's full system portfolio, generating significant interest in the future defining products that we continue to develop and deliver to OEMs.\nMoving to Slide 11, before I turn the call over to Joe, I wanted to comment on our outlook for 2022. As we've already discussed, we continue to face headwinds related to supply chain disruptions and material cost inflation. However, as we manage through these day-to-day challenges, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to build a more sustainable business and deliver lasting value creation, which has translated into market share gains, accelerated revenue growth and increased underlying profitability, driven by the development of advanced technologies that are accelerating the transition to electrified software-defined vehicles. As I mentioned earlier, as a result of the confidence we have in our competitive position, we've increased our outlook for growth over market to 8 to 10 points, further validated by recent strong revenue growth and new program awards. And our advanced technologies focused on safe (inaudible) connected megatrends are enabling market share and content gains which will translate into margin expansion and earnings growth. Unfortunately, we expect supply chains to remain tight and disruptions to continue but begin improving in the back half of this year. And inflationary effects, including rising material costs, are likely to be around for some time, but we're managing our cost structure and working to recover the increase in material costs through various pricing, product redesign, sourcing and footprint strategies. Our strategic focus and operating execution, as well as the current headwinds, are reflected in the full year 2022 guidance that Joe will review with you shortly -- which anticipates the continued expansion of our competitive moat, which will leverage into increased new business bookings, accelerated revenue growth and increased margins and cash flow generation.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe to talk through the numbers.\n\nJoseph R. Massaro\n\nSenior VP of Business Operations & CFO, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the fourth quarter financials on Slide 12. As Kevin highlighted earlier, the business drove strong growth over market while supporting our customers despite ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 4% with 12 points of growth above underlying production. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $461 million and $273 million, respectively, reflecting flow-through on lower volume as we lap the rapid second half recovery in 2020, partially offset by strong growth in our key product lines with new program launches in high voltage, active safety and user experience. COVID and supply chain disruption costs of $85 million, a $15 million increase over Q4 2020 and the net negative impact of approximately $80 million for material inflation and foreign exchange.\nEarnings per share in the quarter were $0.56, with the lower operating income levels being partially offset by favorable tax expense, including the tax benefits related to the supply chain disruption costs. The equity income loss at Motional had a $0.21 negative impact.\nLastly, operating cash flow was $669 million, including a positive contribution from working capital, partially offsetting the lower earnings level. Capital expenditures increased $86 million year-over-year to $181 million for the quarter, reflecting the timing of investments ahead of major 2022 program launches.\nLooking at the fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 13. We saw a strong double-digit growth over market in all regions across both segments, reflecting the continued strength of our product line despite lower vehicle production in the quarter and continued supply chain disruptions. FX and commodity movements were also a net favorable revenue as compared to the prior period, largely due to copper price escalations.\nFrom a regional perspective, North America revenues were down 2%, representing 11 points of growth over market, driven by favorable model mix as truck and SUV production continue to outperform passenger cars, as well as active safety and high voltage. In Europe, we saw strong double-digit outgrowth of 11% as user experience launches offset the steep market decline from continued supply chain disruptions in the region. Lastly, in China, revenues reflecting 17 points of growth over market, resulted from new program launches in our active safety, high-voltage and user experience businesses. The continued strong growth above market in the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Aptiv as strong revenue outperformance and record bookings highlighted by Kevin, continues to demonstrate the relevance of our core technologies.\nMoving to the segments on the next slide, advanced Safety and User Experience revenues fell 1% in the quarter, which translates to 15 points of growth over underlying vehicle production. This includes growth in active safety where revenues were up 7% despite the semiconductor supply shortages driven by program ramps in North America and Europe. User experience growth was down for the quarter due to the timing of program launches, but up 5% in the full year. Segment EBITDA was down $82 million due to higher input costs. Inflation in semiconductors and other inputs accounted for roughly $50 million of that decrease. Signal and Power Solutions revenues were down 6%, representing 10% growth over market. The market outperformance was driven by continued strength in our high-voltage product line, as well as strong performance in the engineered components product lines. Commercial vehicle and industrial revenue growth of 7% for the quarter including strength in commercial vehicle despite a flat market.\nEBITDA in the segment was down $135 million in the quarter on lower sales volume and higher supply chain disruption and material costs. Together, those 2 drivers accounted for roughly $70 million of the decrease. For 2021, our high-voltage product lines reported revenues of approximately $1 billion and achieved bookings of $3.5 billion records on both fronts. In addition, high-voltage margins exceeded the segment average for the year.\nTurning now to Slide 15 and our 2022 macro environment. For 2022, we are expecting global vehicle production to increase 6% to approximately 83 million units on an active weighted production basis. We expect 2022 to start slowly as supply chain and COVID constraints continue to impact the industry. Accordingly, we see vehicle production as being roughly flat in the first half of the year. We see supply chain constraints easing as we move through the year, and we expect vehicle production to increase 15% in the second half.\nLooking at the regions, in North America, we expect overall production growth of 9%, with continued favorable truck and SUV mix. In Europe, we anticipate 10% overall production growth, a strong recovery given the relatively greater European production disruption last year. China is expected to be down 1% for the year at approximately 25 million units.\nOn Slide 16, you'll find our 2022 outlook for Aptiv. This current outlook excludes Wind River as the transaction is not expected to close until the third quarter of the year. As was the case in 2021, we will only be providing full year 2022 guidance as supply chain disruptions continue to result in production schedule volatility at our customers. We expect revenue in the range of $17.75 billion to $18.15 billion, up 15% at the midpoint compared to 2021. With global vehicle production expected to grow 6% for the full year, this translates into 9 points of growth above market, in line with our updated 8% to 10% growth over market range. Consistent with prior forecast, this range is multiyear and covers 2022 and 2023. ASUX growth over market of 19% is driven by the continued ramp of active safety and user experience programs in Europe and North America, while SPS growth over market of 6% is driven by further penetration in our high voltage and engineered components businesses.\nEBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at the midpoint, with margin expansion across both segments. Consistent with 2021, although our core product line profitability continues to be in line with our expectations, we will incur meaningful costs related to COVID safety protocols, supply chain disruptions and material inflation. COVID and supply chain disruption costs are estimated at $230 million, an improvement of $100 million over 2021. We expect the improvement to come in the second half of the year as supply chain disruptions lessened and we lapped a heavily disrupted third quarter of 2021. We expect materials inflation to increase approximately $200 million in 2022. While we continue to make progress on mitigating these costs, we expect these efforts to take until 2023 as we have noted in prior quarters.\nAs FX and commodities will have a negative impact of $60 million versus 2021, driven by copper pricing at $4.40 and a euro rate of $1.14.\nAs we discussed in our January 12 Wind River acquisition call, beginning in 2022, we will change our definition of adjusted EPS to exclude amortization. Annual amortization in 2022 is estimated to be $150 million.\nThe appendix to this presentation includes a reconciliation highlighting the change, including the prior year.\nFor 2022, we estimate adjusted earnings per share to be $4.35, an increase of 42% over the comparable adjusted 2021 totals. We expect 2022 operating cash flow of just over $2 billion, driven by the earnings increase and favorable working capital of roughly $400 million. Lastly, we estimate total CapEx to be approximately 5% of sales.\nSlide 17 includes the puts and takes of our 2022 revenue and EBITDA guidance as compared to 2021. Starting with revenue on the left, we've already discussed our expected industry recovery of approximately 6% for the full year. In our new growth over market framework of 8% to 10% adds approximately $1.75 billion of additional revenues. We expect a slight headwind from FX and commodities and assume price downs of 2%. For adjusted EBITDA on the right-hand side of the slide, we expect to see the benefit of our flexible and scalable cost structure, driving strong volume flow-through on higher revenues, partially offset by the impact of price downs. As noted, while COVID and supply chain disruption costs remain in 2022, we are expecting a year-over-year improvement of $100 million. And FX and material inflation costs are a net headwind of approximately $265 million for the year, driven by rising semiconductor and resin prices and unfavorable FX rates year-over-year. EBITDA totals $2.6 billion at the midpoint, an increase of approximately 28% over 2021.\nTurning to Slide 18. We wanted to provide a few more details around Wind River, noting again that we expect the transaction to close later this year, and the Wind River financials are not included in the 2022 guide. As we talked about in January, the Wind River product portfolio of Intelligent Edge operating systems and middleware has been a long-established leader in edge devices requiring robust compute performance. In early 2021, the company introduced Wind River Studio, a software subscription offering that incorporates their core products, as well as the cloud-enabled tools for the development deployment and full life cycle management of intelligent edge software solutions. Targeted in multiple industries, including telecom, aerospace and defense as well as automotive, Studio has grown quickly and represented over 10% of revenues in 2021. In 2022, revenue will continue to accelerate with top line growth of 12% to 15%.\nWind River Studio is expected to represent 40% to 50% of the revenues by the 2024, 2025 timeframe. The growth in studio driven by further penetration in key industries, including automotive, will help Wind River achieve approximately $1 billion of revenue by 2026.\nAs noted during our January call, the Wind River acquisition also brings financial benefits to Aptiv, including acceleration of ASUX revenues and reduced spending on third-party software. By year 4, following the transaction, these benefits will equal an incremental $125 million of run rate earnings for Aptiv.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Clark\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Aptiv Plc\n\nThanks, Joe. I'll now wrap up on Slide 19 before we open it up for questions. As we reflect on 2021 and our outlook for 2022, it's clear that our constant focus on innovation and flawless execution has positioned us to better support our customers and is resulting in a stronger competitive position which we've converted into record new business bookings and revenue growth over market. While we expect near-term headwinds to persist through the better part of 2022, we remain confident in our operating execution and our product portfolio aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends.\nI'm proud of the Aptiv team and all we accomplished during a challenging 2021, but I'm even more excited about what we'll deliver during 2022. We're well positioned to continue to outperform as a purpose-driven company with a track record and strategy to deliver significant value for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.\nOperator, let's open up the line for questions."

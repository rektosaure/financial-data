Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.\nAnd for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q3 2025 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated. All comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements.\nActual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nCEO of Amazon Web Services Inc., Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion, if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5 billion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion.\nI'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate and to have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October, which together or more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little more detail on why.\nIt starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-ups, enterprises and governments want to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS has more services and deeper features within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part of why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years. We're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models. Bedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well positioned to be a leader.\nCompanies will both create their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched strands to make it much easier to create agents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production because they lack secure scalable runtime services or memory or observability built specifically for agents. It's why we launched AgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform with enterprise-level security, observability and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler.\nCompanies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000 developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview and that number has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and tool call and capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to save 700,000 hours of manual effort. The equivalent of 335 developer years of work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives and completing tasks or a times faster than with other migration tools.\nCustomers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched QuickSleep to bring a consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data and take actions. We've already seen users churn months long projects in today's get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for contact centers, we offer Amazon Connect which creates a more personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers and their customers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota, American Airlines and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers, and there are many more examples like them.\nBecause of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance and customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and government transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies want to run AI and AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power. This capacity consists of power, data center and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA.\nWe've recently brought Project Rainier Online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data centers and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is using it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude, which we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end. Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on Trainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to keep growing our relationships over time.\nYou're going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS.\nI'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices and convenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection since last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands this year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from Amazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-day delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours.\nThe team also invented a new add to delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled orders and it's been used more than 80 million times since launch, and it's just launch. It's an example of one of those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers' lives easier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime Day event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S. cities.\nWe're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the U.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-day and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total communities we plan to expand to by the end of the year. The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping assistant has had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-over-year and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales.\nHere are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products and millions of customers have used it streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products with their phones camera, a screenshot or a bar code, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a swipeable carousel. Tens and millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month.\nMoving on to Amazon ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo advertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than $300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be excited about our demand side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku and we've built on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and SoundCloud and we're excited about the advertising opportunity around prime video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from advertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the board.\nFinally, we're continuing to invade for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an agentic AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead of weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026 and new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Videos add-on subscription offering of over 100 channels in the U.S.\nWe continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience, Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader range of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic using natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with photos 4x more and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations that end in a purchase. We've expanded the number of project hyper satellites and space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and test with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we know of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington, D.C. as the eighth testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more riders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for AWS. The innovations will announce the reinvent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-powered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the holiday season and a lot more.\nThanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes 2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is recorded in the other operating expense line.\nThe second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for roll eliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments. The severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding these 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\nMoving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the inputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries and have them delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers continue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive prices.\nWe're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment operating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the severance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance charge International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year.\nGlobally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations and our regionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits of our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead time by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital. We're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S. customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the same day and as little as 5 hours.\nWe're seeing positive early results since launching in January, when customers start shopping groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers. Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve our activity in our global fulfillment and transportation network. We continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance travel and touches for package. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and automation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a delivered approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term.\nShifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion and growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating.\nMoving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-year. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more capacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion, and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were placed into service related to depreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time.\nNow turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026.\nI'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in nonoperating income. We're encouraged by the start of the peak season and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we get ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive sustainable value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.",

It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $167.7 billion in revenue, up 12% year over year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $19.2 billion, up 31% year over year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow was $18.2 billion. We saw good progress across our various customer experiences and businesses this past quarter. Starting with stores, we feel good about both the inputs and outputs of the business. At Amazon, we think of our business in terms of inputs and outputs. Outputs are metrics like revenue or operating margin, but of course, you can't manage at the output level. It's the inputs that drive the outputs, so we spend virtually all of our time internally talking about and goaling against inputs. The inputs that matter most to customers in our stores business are selection, low prices, and speed of delivery.\nWe've taken another step forward in selection these past few months, headlined by the much-requested return of Nike's products to Amazon's retail store. We've added premium brands like Aveda, Marc Jacobs fragrances, and brands from Saks on Amazon like Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Stella McCartney, Rosetta Getty, and La Prairie. We started expanding our very successful perishables pilot, where we offer customers perishables at the point of purchase when they're ordering other items that will be delivered same day from our same-day fulfillment nodes. We're seeing strong customer adoption, as 75% of customers who've used the service this year are first-time shoppers for perishables on Amazon, with 20% of customers who use the service returning multiple times within their first month. Our prices continue to be low and sharp for customers.\nIt's one of the reasons our everyday essentials growth outpaced the rest of the business globally and represented 1 out of every 3 units sold. It's also why well-known research firm Profitero has concluded for 8 years in a row that Amazon has the lowest prices of any US retailer. Perhaps the clearest outputs are the rate at which our stores business grew this past quarter, and the success we saw in our recent Prime Day event. This year's Prime Day was our biggest ever, with record sales, number of items sold, and number of Prime sign-ups in the 3 weeks leading up to Prime Day. Customers saved billions of dollars, and independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, saw their best sales performance of any Prime Day event yet.\nThere continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption. Much of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen. Where will tariffs finally settle, especially China? What happens when we deplete the inventory we forward bought or that our selling partners forward deployed in advance of the tariffs going into effect? If costs end up being higher, who will absorb them? What we can share is what we've seen thus far, which is that through the first half of the year, we haven't yet seen diminishing demand nor prices meaningfully appreciating.\nWe also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total, with differing strategies of whether to pass on higher costs to consumers, that customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about. Further improving delivery speed remains a key focus, and we continue to make progress. We've previously shared how we re-architect our US inbound network into a regional structure, allowing us to place inventory and ship from locations closer to customers, improving speed and lowering costs. That work is delivering tangible results. In Q2, we've increased the share of orders moving through direct lanes, where packages go straight from fulfillment to delivery without extra stops, by over 40% year over year. We've also reduced the average distance packages traveled by 12% and lowered handling touches per unit by nearly 15%.\nWe've made progress on order consolidation. With more products positioned locally, we're able to pack more items into each box and send fewer packages per order. That has helped drive higher units per box, and improved overall cost to serve. Taken together, these improvements are making the network faster and structurally more efficient. We've also set another global speed record in Q2, delivering to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In the US, we delivered 30% more items same day or next day than during the same period last year. Items customers used to pick up locally in nearby physical stores are now arriving at their door, often within hours. We're working to further improve delivery speeds no matter where customers live. We've recently announced plans to expand our same-day and next-day delivery to tens of millions of US.\nCustomers in more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns, and rural communities by the end of the year. Today, it's already available in more than 1,000 of these communities across the US. The early response from customers in these areas has been very positive. They're shopping more frequently, and purchasing household essentials at meaningfully higher rates. Automation and robotics are also important contributors to improving cost efficiencies and driving better customer experiences over time. We deployed our one millionth robot across our global fulfillment network, and unveiled innovations at our last-mile innovation center, such as automated package sorting and a transformative technology that brings packages directly to employees at an ergonomic height. We rolled out Deep Fleet, our AI that improves robot travel efficiency by 10%. At our scale, that's a big deal.\nDeep Fleet acts like a traffic management system to coordinate robots' movements to find optimal paths and reduce bottlenecks. For customers, it means faster delivery times and lower costs. For our team members, our robots handle more of the physically demanding tasks, making our operations network even safer. This combination of robotics and generative AI is just getting started, and while we've made significant progress, it's still early with respect to what we'll roll out in the next few years. Moving on to Amazon Ads, we're pleased with the strong growth, generating $15.7 billion of revenue in the quarter, growing 22% year over year. We continue to see strength across our broad portfolio of full-funnel advertising offerings that, in the US alone, help advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million across our own properties.\nThese are properties like our retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, and Fire TV, in live sports such as NFL, NASCAR, and the NBA, as well as third-party websites and apps. Another area we're excited about is our demand-side platform, or Amazon DSP. Our DSP enables advertisers to plan, activate, and measure full-funnel investments. Our trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping, and streaming signals, paired with extensive supply-side relationships and our secure clean rooms, provide advertisers the ability to optimize advertising, deliver greater precision, and drive efficient and effective advertising outcomes. In June, we announced a momentous partnership with Roku, giving advertisers access to 80 million connected TV households, the largest authenticated connected TV footprint in the US, exclusively through Amazon DSP. It's a giant leap forward for advertisers, bringing best-in-class planning, audience precision, and performance to TV advertising.\nWe also announced an integration between Disney's Real-Time Ad Exchange and Amazon DSP. This collaboration allows advertisers to gain direct access to Disney's premium inventory across platforms like Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu, while allowing them to leverage insights from both companies. When advertisers work with Amazon, they're not just buying ad space. They're benefiting from exceptional programming, innovative technology, and unrivaled signals, measurement, and audience development that provide strong relevancy for consumers and return on investment for brands. Moving on to AWS. In Q2, AWS grew 17.5% year over year and now has over a $123 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to help organizations of all sizes accelerate their transition to the cloud, signing new agreements with companies including PepsiCo, Airbnb, Peloton, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, Nissan Motor, GitLab, SAP, Warner Bros. Discovery, Twelve Labs, FICO, Iberia Airlines, SK Telecom, and NatWest.\nIn the rapidly evolving world of generative AI, AWS continues to build a large, fast-growing, triple-digit year-over-year percentage, multi-billion-dollar business with more demand than we have supply for at the moment. A few points to make. First, on the hardware side, our custom AI chip, Trainium 2, is landing capacity in larger quantities, and has impressively emerged as the backbone for Anthropic's newest generation Claude models and many of our most essential offerings like Amazon Bedrock. We've also launched Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips, AWS's most powerful NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instance. Second, in Bedrock, we've recently added Anthropic's Claude 4, and it's the fastest-growing model ever in Bedrock. We've also continued to see strong adoption of Amazon Nova, our own frontier model, and it's now the second most popular foundation model in Bedrock.\nNew features in Nova allow customers to customize their Nova models in ways they can't on other foundation models, allowing organizations to infuse these models with their unique expertise while optimizing for cost and speed. As people have become excited about building agents, they're realizing they lack the tools to build them. In May, we released Strands, an open-source way to more easily build agents that's taken off with a wide range of customers, with already 2,500 stars on GitHub and over 300,000 downloads on PyPI. Customers are also struggling with deploying agents into production in a secure and scalable way. It's holding up enterprises' scaling agents. To help solve that problem, Bedrock just released Agent Core.\nAgent Core is a set of building blocks that gives customers the industry's first secure serverless runtime to provide both synchronous and asynchronous execution, agent identity and boundaries, a memory service, a gateway that translates services to MCP-compatible interfaces, built-in code execution and web browser tools, and an observability service. Customers are excited about Agent Core, and it frees them up to start deploying agents more expansively. Third, you're starting to see AWS release more powerful applications at the top layer of the AI stack. AWS Transform is an AWS agent that dramatically reduces mainframe modernization timelines from years to months, completes VMware to EC2 conversions up to 80 times faster, and makes it simple to move from .NET Windows to .NET Linux implementations, reducing licensing costs for .NET applications by up to 40%. We've also just released Kiro, our new agentic integrated development environment coding agent.\nThere's a lot of buzz around Kiro, with several hundred thousand developers using or requesting access in the first couple of weeks, 100,000 used in the first 5 days of the preview. What struck a chord for developers is that Kiro allows them to do vibe coding, where developers use natural language to chat with a coding agent to build code. Unlike other coding agents, where developers do not really have any structure to build on top of, Kiro allows developers to use natural language to build a spec, and then automatically updates that spec as they continue to vibe code or interact with Kiro. This makes it much easier to go from prototyping to production. Customers also like Kiro's event-driven agent hooks that act like an experienced developer catching things developers might miss. When developers save a React component, hooks update the test file.\nWhen they modify API endpoints, hooks refresh README files. When they're ready to commit, security hooks scan for leaked credentials. It's still very early for Kiro, but it seems clear we're onto something customers love, and Kiro has a chance to transform how developers build software. I say this frequently, but remember that 85% to 90% of worldwide IT spend is still on-premises versus in the cloud. In the next 10 to 15 years, that equation is going to flip, further accelerated by companies' excitement for leveraging AI. AWS's significantly broader functionality, stronger security and operational performance, and much deeper experience helping enterprises modernize their infrastructure bodes well for the AWS business moving forward. We're also seeing momentum in a number of our other areas across Amazon. I'll mention just a few. We're excited about our progress with Alexa Plus, our next-generation assistant powered by generative AI.\nWe've been rolling out early access to US customers to start. Millions of customers have access now. We're seeing very positive feedback, and will continue to iterate on the experience. We've recently completed our third successful launch of Project Kuiper. We haven't launched this service commercially yet, but already have an impressive amount of enterprise and government customers who have signed agreements to use Kuiper. In Prime Video Live Sports, our first season of NASCAR drew about 2 million viewers per race, and the youngest audience among NASCAR broadcasters in more than a decade. We've recently announced our stellar broadcasting crew for our upcoming first NBA season, including Ian Eagle, Stan Van Gundy, Kevin Harlan, Dwyane Wade, Taylor Rooks, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, and Candace Parker. We also announced Denis Villeneuve, an Academy Award nominee, as the director for the next James Bond film.\nJames Bond is in the hands of one of today's greatest filmmakers, and we cannot wait to get started on 007's next adventure. Finally, we continue to be very pleased with the growth and resonance of Amazon Pharmacy as it's grown 50% year over year year to date on an already significant size base. A lot of good things happening across the company. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Andy. Let's start with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $167.7 billion, a 12% increase year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had a $1.5 billion favorable impact to revenue in the quarter, as foreign currencies generally strengthened versus the US dollar. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue guidance had anticipated an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points or $100 million.\nWorldwide operating income was $19.2 billion, which was $1.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across our segments, we continue to prioritize cost-effective innovation that delivers value for our customers. In the North America segment, second-quarter revenue was $100.1 billion, an increase of 11% year over year. International segment revenue was $36.8 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 12% year over year. We remain focused on inputs that matter most to our customers. In the second quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our key performance metrics. This includes sharp pricing, more in-stock availability, as well as record delivery speeds for Prime members. Our millions of global sellers continue to be an important contributor to our vast selection. This helps customers find the items they need and does so at a competitive price.\nOur investment in tools, services, and fast delivery speeds help our selling partners reach more customers and further scale their businesses. In Q2, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, the highest ever, up 100 basis points from Q2 of last year. We're also closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. As Andy mentioned, our Q2 plan factored in a range of assumptions, not all of which materialized. We will continue to consider a range of assumptions going forward. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $7.5 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion year on year. North America operating margin was 7.5%, up 190 basis points year over year. International segment operating income was $1.5 billion, up $1.2 billion year over year. International operating margin was 4.1%, up 320 basis points year over year.\nWe're pleased with the strong execution of our operations teams and the positive experience they delivered for customers. In Q2, we saw productivity gains in our transportation network, driven by improved inventory placement, strong leverage on high unit volumes, and higher levels of in-demand inventory from both first-party and third-party selling partners. These factors contributed to faster delivery speeds and lower costs. Outbound shipping costs were up 6% year over year and continue to grow at a meaningfully slower pace than unit growth, which, as I mentioned earlier, was up 12% year over year. We're committed to initiatives that further improve our cost structure. Strategic inventory placement drives multiple benefits, including better in-stock availability, shorter delivery routes, and faster customer delivery times. When we optimize inventory location, we can consolidate more items per package, reducing packaging materials and costs.\nTo achieve this, we will continue to improve upon our inbound network, expand our US same-day delivery facilities, including in rural communities, and implement robotics and automation across our facilities. While year-over-year improvements in operating margin may fluctuate, we have a purposeful strategy to achieve sustained progress over time. Shifting to advertising, advertising revenue grew 22% year over year, driven by sponsored products, as we saw strong traffic in our stores. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American, international segments. Our full-funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $30.9 billion, an increase of 17.5% year over year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $123 billion. During the second quarter, we continue to see growth in both our generative AI and non-generative AI businesses.\nAs companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI, AWS operating income was $10.2 billion. We did see AWS segment margins decline from a record high of 39.5% in Q1 to 32.9% in Q2. The largest quarter-over-quarter driver of the decrease, or about half, is due to the seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense, as well as unfavorable impacts from year-over-year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments in capital expenditures in AWS.\nAs we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers, and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31.4 billion in Q2. We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year. AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services, and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments.\nAdditionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve by investing in same-day delivery facilities, as well as robotics and automation. Collectively, these investments will support growth for many years to come. Moving on to our third-quarter financial guidance. As a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities, which take into consideration Q2 results, trends we see quarter to date, and expectations around the macroeconomic environment, including tariffs. Q3 net sales are expected to be between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q3 operating income is expected to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion.\nIn this dynamic environment, we'll focus on what matters most: delivering exceptional customer value through broad selection, competitive prices, and unmatched convenience. We'll remain focused on driving a better customer experience and believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your headsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nPlease proceed with your question.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions. I have 2. First, can you just help us understand with some more granularity how tariffs are being absorbed across suppliers, Amazon, and consumers, and whether you anticipate any change going forward? Second, on AWS, we're seeing significantly faster cloud growth among the number 2 and 3 players in the space. I totally appreciate that AWS is coming off of a bigger base. Beyond that, do you think the output gap is due more to customer demand or infrastructure supply or both? Thanks.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, I'll take both those. I'll start with the tariffs. You know, I think what we've said a number of times, and we still believe it, is we just don't know what's going to happen moving forward. It's hard to know where the tariffs are going to settle, particularly in China.\nIt's hard to know what will happen when we deplete some of the pre-buys that we did on our own first-party retail, then some of the forward deploying that we saw of our third-party selling partners. If costs go up over time, we're unsure at this point who's going to end up absorbing those higher costs. What we can tell you is what we've seen so far in the first half of the year. In the first half, we just haven't seen diminished demand, and we haven't seen any kind of broad-scale ASP increases. That could change in the second half. There are a lot of things that we don't know, but that's what we've seen so far.\nOn the question on AWS, the first thing I'd say is, as you said, Doug, in your question, year-over-year percentages and growth rates are always a function of the base on which you operate. We have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others. I think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS. When we look at the results over the last number of quarters, there are some times where, as far as we can tell, we're growing faster than others, and sometimes others are growing faster than us. It's still, if you look at the second-place player you're talking about, a pretty significant market segment leadership position that we have. Regardless, these are all really just moments in time.\nThe last week is a moment in time, too, where the reality of what really matters is what customers' experiences are in operating on these platforms. If you look at what matters to customers, they care a lot about what the operational performance is, what the availability is, what the durability is, what the latency and throughput is of the various services. I think we have a pretty significant advantage in that area. They care a lot about security. If you have data that matters, and for most companies, they're putting data that they really care about in the cloud, the security and the privacy of that data matters a lot. There are very different results in security in AWS than you'll see in other players. Yeah, you could just look at what's happened the last couple of months.\nYou can just see kind of adventures at some of these players almost every month. Very big difference, I think, in security. I think a really significant difference in functionality, where not just in the core infrastructure do we have a lot more functionality in our services, but I think if you look at our end-to-end offering in AI, it's from the bottom of the stack all the way to the top. It's pretty different. I feel good about the inputs and the services that we're offering to customers across AI, as well as non-AI. We have more demand than we have capacity right now. We could be doing more revenue and helping customers more. We're working very hard on changing that outcome and how much capacity we have.\nIt's still, if you look at the business, it's a $123 billion annual revenue run rate business, and it's still early. I mean, how often do you have an opportunity that's $123 billion of annual revenue run rate where you say it's still early? It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director and Heads Evercore ISI, Evercore\n\nOkay. I'll stick with AWS to start it with. Could you just disclose the backlog number? In the past, I know you've talked about these supply constraints and hoping that they will sort of resolve themselves by the back half of the year. Is that still your intention? Anything that suggests that the supply constraints are going to get resolved earlier or later? A long-term question on Alexa Plus.\nI've been experimenting with it for a while. Just, Andy, when you think about the potential that that has in terms of increasing engagement, maybe tapping into some services revenue, advertising, maybe a little bit more retail sales per household, you're just reducing friction. Just talk about, from a financial perspective, how you think that could play out, how we would maybe see that in numbers. Thank you very much.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHey, Mark, this is Dave. I'll just start off to give you the backlog figure. At the end of the quarter, at 30 June, that was $195 billion. That's up about 25% year over year.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nOn the supply constraints as it relates to AWS and what we see there, as I mentioned, we have more demand than we have capacity at this point.\nI think that, and you see some of the constraints, and they kind of exist in multiple places. The single biggest constraint is power. You also see constraints off and on with chips and then some of the components that, once you have the chips to actually make the servers, there are sometimes you have new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they're supposed to be. Sometimes you get the chips, and the yield you get in making servers isn't what you expect when you get to ramp. There are a bunch of those pieces today that we're working on. It's really true across the industry today. I don't believe that we will have fully resolved the amount of capacity we need for the amount of demand that we have in a couple of quarters. I think it will take several quarters.\nI do expect that it's going to get better each quarter. I'm optimistic about that. I think on the Alexa question, I'd start by saying the Alexa Plus experience is so much better than, I think, our prior Alexa experience. She's much more intelligent than her prior self, she's much more capable, and I would say, unlike the other chatbots that are out there today who are good at answering questions but really can't take any action for you, Alexa Plus can take a lot of action for you, which is very compelling. I can ask Alexa to play music for me or play video for me or move my music from one device to another.\nIf I'm listening to a song that's in a movie, I can ask Alexa Plus to actually put that movie scene on of a song I'm playing, and it'll put it on my Prime Video and Fire TV. If I have guests coming over, I can say, Alexa, draw the curtains, put the light on the porch and the driveway, increase the temperature by 5 degrees, and put on music that would be great for a dinner party. She does all that just through using natural language. She can take a lot of actions, and it's compelling. What we see so far, we've been rolling out Alexa Plus starting in the US. It's with millions of customers now, the rest in the US coming in the next couple of months, and starting the international rollout more broadly later in the year.\nCustomers really like the experience. They recognize how much better it is than what it was before. The ratings are very high, the usage is much more expansive than what they were using before, and the number of calls they're making is meaningfully higher. I think there are a number of different areas where we'll see benefit. I think first, if you build the world's best personal assistant, that has a lot of utility for customers, and therefore it gets used a lot. It means everything from people are excited about the devices that they can buy from us that have Alexa Plus enabled in them. People do a lot of shopping, and it's a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better.\nI think over time, there will be opportunities as people are engaging more multi-turn conversations to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery, and also as a lever to drive revenue. I think over time, you could also imagine as we keep adding functionality that there could be some sort of subscription element beyond what there is today. Today, Prime members get Alexa Plus for free, and non-Prime members pay $19.99 a month for Alexa Plus. I think it's still very early days, but we're very encouraged by the experience we're providing. You can bet we're going to be iterating on it constantly.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks for taking the questions.\nI guess, first off, with respect to the international segment and the progress in both revenues and margins, I was hoping you could add maybe some color on the drivers of each of those and the sustainability of the improved efficiency in those markets. Andy, you mentioned Kuiper. We haven't heard as much about that of late. Maybe if you could review where things stand relative to next year's launch target, timing of the service rollout, and any perspective you have on the longer-term ambitions for the satellite network. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Colin. This is Brian. I'll start with the international segment question. Very strong quarter for international segment, both on revenue growth and also on operating margin. Operating margin was up 320 basis points year over year to 4.1%.\nIf you look, that's the continuation of a strong progression we've seen quarter by quarter over the last 10 quarters. In total, we've seen an increase of close to 700 basis points during that time period. Really, it's a tale of 2 pieces of 2 segments or, excuse me, sections within international. One is the established countries like the UK, Germany, and Japan, already at similar margin profiles to the US. As they continue to grow, their contribution to profit will grow over time. That's what we're seeing. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network in those countries, much like we saw in the US. That's led to higher units per package and faster delivery speeds at lower cost.\nThe theme of lower cost to serve, increased speed, and better selection for customers continues to grow internationally as well. In our emerging countries, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. We've launched 8 countries in the last 5 years. They're all at varying degrees of upfront investment and different points in their journey to profitability, but they're all making very nice improvements quarter over quarter in growing selection, adding Prime members, and expanding our customer offering. I think what you're seeing is sustained improvement in those areas. Feel very good about it. The established countries are continuing to grow and develop and very much look like the US. The emerging countries are all at very different stages of growth right now.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nOn the Project Kuiper question, Project Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite constellation that we're putting up and launching. There are 400 to 500 million households worldwide who don't have broadband connectivity. It means they can't do a lot of the things we take for granted, like education online, business online, shopping, or entertainment. There is really a digital divide, and it's much needed. It's also true for enterprises and for governments that they have assets or needs to have visibility or connectivity that they can't get today, given the lack of broadband in a bunch of places around the world. There's a high need. I would say that as we get our constellation into space, there will really be 2 players that have what I would consider the modern technology in low Earth orbit satellite.\nOne is the incumbent in the market today, and the second will be Project Kuiper. I think that we will have a pretty meaningful differentiation here in performance. If you look at the performance of what I expect on the uplink and downlink, I think Project Kuiper will be advantaged. I also think the pricing is going to be very compelling for customers. If you think about the 3 key customer segments who want low Earth orbit satellite: consumers, enterprises, and governments, we have very strong relationships with all 3 customer segments, given our consumer businesses and our AWS business.\nI think if you think about enterprises and governments, a lot of what they want to do when they take the data down from space is they actually want to put it into a cloud to do analysis, analytics, and AI, and various operations on top of it. The fact that Project Kuiper and AWS are so seamlessly connected is very attractive to enterprises and to governments. I'm kind of amazed. We haven't launched Project Kuiper yet, but the number of enterprise and government agreements that have been signed already to use Project Kuiper is impressive. We're working very hard to get the satellites into space. We have some delays with some of the rocket providers, but we have most of the available rocket launches over the next couple of years.\nWe're very hopeful to get the service into commercial beta later this year, early next year.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nThanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have 2 for you on AWS. They're a little tough, but I'm going to throw them at you. There is a Wall Street finance person narrative right now that AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss to peers, etc. Can you just sort of address that? What is your rebuttal to that? Talk to us about your and the team's most important focal points just to ensure that AWS stays on the knife's edge of innovation versus hyperscaler peers.\nI know AWS is a big business, but is there any reason to assume it shouldn't accelerate in the back half and into 2026, given the size of the opportunity and all of the GenAI capabilities going to sort of come to us in the next 12 months?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nYeah. On the first one around AI, the first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look at what's really happening in the space, it's very top-heavy. You have a small number of very large frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being trained on top of AWS, and others are being trained elsewhere. You also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications.\nThe one category would be chatbots, with the largest by a fair bit being ChatGPT, but the other category being really, I'll call it coding agents. These are companies like Cursor, or Vercel, and Lovable, and some of the companies like that, again, several of which run significant chunks on top of AWS. Then you've got a very large number of generative AI applications that are in pilot mode, or that are in pilots, or that are being developed as we speak, and a very substantial number of agents that also people are starting to try to build and figure out how to get into production in a broad way. They're quite early. Many of them that are out there are significant, but they're just smaller in terms of usage relative to some of those top-heavy applications I mentioned earlier.\nWe have a very significant number of enterprises and startups who are running applications on top of AWS's AI services. They're all, again, the amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production and the number of agents that are going to exist, it's still just earlier stage than it's going to be. When you think about what's going to matter in AI, what are customers going to care about when they're thinking about what infrastructure to use, I think you kind of have to look at the different layers of the stack. I think for those that are both building models, but also just if you look at where the real costs are, they're going to ultimately be in inference.\nToday, so much of the cost is in training because customers are really training their models and trying to figure out how to get applications into production. At scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be in inference because you only train periodically, but you're spitting out predictions and inferences all the time. What they're going to care a lot about is the compute and the hardware they're using. We have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as I can foresee. We saw this movie in the CPU space with Intel where customers are hankering for better price performance. We built, just like in the CPU space, our own custom silicon in building Graviton, which is about 40% more price performant than the other leading x86 processors.\nWe've done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium. Our second version of Trainium 2 has really become the backbone of Anthropic's next Claude models that they're training on top of, and it's become the backbone of Bedrock and the inference that we do. I think a lot of the inference, it's about 30% to 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers out there right now. We're already working on our third version of Trainium as well. I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium 2, and I think that that price performance is going to matter to people as they get to scale.\nI would say that that middle layer of the stack, it's a combination of services that customers care about to be able to build models and then to be able to leverage existing leading frontier models, and then build high-quality generative AI applications that do inference at scale. We see it for people building models. They continue to use SageMaker AI very expansively. Bedrock, when you're leveraging leading frontier models, is also growing very substantially. As I said in my opening comments, the number of agents at scale is still really small on the scheme of what's going to be the case. Part of the problem is it's actually hard to actually build agents, and it's hard to deploy these agents in a secure and scalable way.\nI think the launches we made recently in Strands that make it much easier to build agents, and then Agent Core that make it much easier to deploy at scale and in a secure way, are being very well received, and customers are excited. It's going to change what's possible on the agent side. I think that you've got a very large number. I mean, remember, 85% to 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do and we do, you have a lot of legacy infrastructure that you've got to move. These are mainframes. These are VMware instances.\nWhen we build agents like AWS Transform, they make it much easier to move mainframes to the cloud, much easier to move VMware to the cloud, much easier to move .NET Windows to .NET Linux to save money. Those are compelling for enterprises or things like Kiro that allow customers to develop in a much easier way and in a much more structured way, which is why I think people are excited about it. I really like the inputs and the set of services that we're building in the AI space today. Customers really like them, and it's resonating with them. I still think it's very early days in AI and in terms of adoption.\nThe other thing I would just say is that, remember, because we're at a stage right now where so much of the activity is training and figuring out how to get your generative AI applications into production, people aren't paying as close attention as they will in making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest of their data and infrastructure is. Remember, a lot of generative AI inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage, and database. People are going to actually want to run those applications close to where their other applications are running, where their data is. There are just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere else. I'm very optimistic about, as we get to a bigger scale, what's going to happen for AWS on the AI side.\nI think we have a set of services that is unique, top to bottom in the stack. I think on the last part about what do we expect with respect to acceleration, we don't give guidance by segment. I'm not going to try and give you guidance. I do believe that the combination of more enterprises who have resumed their march to modernize their infrastructure and move from on-premises to the cloud, coupled with the fact that AI is going to accelerate in terms of more companies deploying more AI applications into production that start to scale, coupled with the fact that I do think that more capacity is going to come online in the coming months and quarters, make me optimistic about the AWS business.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRon Josey\n\nU.S. Internet Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat.\nThanks. Thanks for that, Andy. That was really helpful. Maybe taking that same question, but focusing internally on Amazon. I think you penned an article or a blog post back in June just talking about the ability or potential with GenAI agents and improving efficiencies and speed to market internally. I would love to hear your thoughts as you think about how Amazon is adopting generative AI internally, how perhaps you've seen improving speed to market as a result of everything you've just talked about. Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nYeah. I think that AI is the biggest technology transformation of our lifetime, which is saying a lot because even in some of our relatively short lifetimes, we've been through the cloud, mobile, and the internet itself. I think it's going to be the biggest transformation technically in our lifetime.\nI think it's going to not only change every customer experience that we know and enable customer experiences we really only dreamed about before, but it's also going to change very substantially the way we work. If you think about it, the way that we do coding, the way that we do analytics, the way that we do research, the way that we do finance and measure finance, I mean, really, the way we do business process automation, the way we do customer service, every single area that I can think of in the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI. I think when you have a big shift like that, you have 2 macro choices.\nYou can either decide that you're going to embrace it, you're going to help shape it, and you're going to figure out how to build the right tools to allow you to take advantage of the technology, or you can wish it away and have it shape you. The posting that you're referencing, Ron, that I made was just really being clear with the team that we're going to pursue that former approach, that we are going to embrace it, and we're going to try and shape it. We have a number of tools and agents that we've built already inside the company. These are things like if you think about Kiro and the opportunity to have coding agents do a lot of the coding, that's very compelling.\nIt's going to allow our teammates to be able to start from a more advanced starting spot and to be able to invent for customers much more quickly and much more expansively. If you think about services like Connect, which is our AWS service that does call center software, that has a lot of AI built into it that changes the productivity of all your customer service agents. You can just imagine across the board the types of things we're going to do to make it easier to get software out, to build high-quality software, to do operations, QA, to automate a lot of the business process coordination that happens inside the cloud. We're going to work on a whole bunch of those areas to allow ourselves primarily to be able to invent for customers much more quickly and expansively.\nI think it's going to make all of our teammates' jobs much more enjoyable because they won't have to do as many of the rote parts of the job that we all do right now. They're going to be able to own more pieces of what they're trying to solve for customers. We want deep owners that want to own as much end-to-end as possible.\n\nModerator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. I'll just ask on the revenue guidance. It looks pretty robust growth in the third quarter.\nI know you won't say whether AWS is expected to accelerate, but could you talk about some of the drivers and what kind of tariff and other contingencies you've put in there, and then maybe any thoughts on how you're thinking about how the Q4 is shaping up? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hi, Justin. This is Brian. I'll take this one. Yeah, we've got it to $174 billion to $175 billion, and we, excuse me, $179.5 billion, had a typo. We feel good about the growth rate in Q2 that we had, and the acceleration in a number of areas, including units. We had a very successful Prime Day earlier this month. There is uncertainty on where tariffs will settle, and maybe the ultimate impact on consumers is, as Andy mentioned earlier. We feel really good about the key inputs. We control price, selection, and convenience.\nWe've talked about delivery speeds increasing, we've talked about selection increasing, high in-stock levels, well-dispersed inventory close to customers. We think that all works in our favor. I would say we're cautiously optimistic. I'm not going to give any guidance for Q4 at this time, but we'll talk about that next time.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n\nModerator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2025 Financial Results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello and welcome to our Q1 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have a press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 1 May 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements.\nActual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $155.7 billion United States dollars in revenue up 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is $18.4 billion United States dollars, up 20% year-over-year and trailing twelve month free cash flow is $25.9 billion United States dollars. We're pleased with our continued business progress. More importantly, with our pace of innovation and additional improvement in our customer experiences in our stores business, we once again saw strong consumer resonance. In our continued work on selection, value, and shipping speed, our broad selection offers customers choice across their shopping journeys.\nWe welcome well known brands such as Oura Rings, Michael Kors, and The Ordinary, as well as a new shopping experience with Saks that offers a refined luxury assortment of fashion and beauty items from brands like Dolce & Gabbana and Balmain, ERDEM, Giambattista Valli, and Jason Wu Collection. As always, we're working to keep prices low, and with this being an uncertain moment for consumers, it's even more important than it typically is in Q1, we held deal events worldwide to help customers save over $500 million United States dollars across the business, Big Spring Sale in the US and Canada, Spring Deal Days in Europe and Ramadan Eid Sale events in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE.\nPrime members will have more opportunities to save throughout the year, including at our 11th Prime Day event in July. Over the past few years, we've made significant progress in making our fulfillment network more efficient and cost effective. We've shared many times that an important turning point was regionalizing our national fulfillment network into regional hubs by stocking items closer to where customers live. We're able to deliver more orders faster, often in fewer packages, and at lower delivery costs. The next challenge was getting as many items as possible into these regional nodes.\nOur inbound network, which is how we get items to each fulfillment center, hadn't been architected to leverage this new regionalization structure. We redesigned it and just rolled out a new inbound architecture that expands the share of products that we can place in each fulfillment center, improving delivery speeds and lowering our cost to serve. In the first quarter, we once again set new delivery speed records with our fastest delivery ever for Prime members around the world. We delivered more items in the same day or next day in Q1 than any other quarter in our history.\nLooking ahead, we'll continue to refine our newly redesigned inbound network, build out our same day delivery sites, and add additional robotics and automation throughout our buildings. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas of the US, we can get items to people who live in less densely populated areas much more quickly. I thought I'd share a few thoughts on the prospect of heightened tariffs on our stores business. Obviously, none of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when. We haven't seen any attenuation of demand yet.\nTo some extent, we've seen some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact. We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet. Some of this reflects some forward buying we did in our first-party selling. Some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third party sellers have done. A fair amount of this is that most sellers just haven't changed pricing yet. Again, this could change depending on where tariffs settle. Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs.\nAs it relates to China, retailers who aren't buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding, and selling to US consumers. These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to US consumers in our marketplace. The total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers. It's also sometimes easy to forget what Amazon sells. We're not mostly selling high average selling price items, though we certainly sell a bunch. In the first quarter, our everyday essentials grew more than twice as fast as the rest of our business and represented one out of every three units sold in the US on Amazon.\nEven if you exclude Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the US, with over $100 billion United States dollar in gross sales last year. People are buying a lot of their everyday essentials at Amazon. We also have extremely large selection of hundreds of millions of unique SKUs, which means we're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When there are periods of discontinuity, substantial unexpected product trends emerge. Think about the pandemic when items like masks and hand sanitizer became big sellers.\nWhen you have the broadest selection, like we do, and 2 million plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere. Finally, when there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most given our really broad selection, low pricing. Speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain eras with more relative market segment share than we started, and better set up for the future. I'm optimistic this could happen again.\nMoving to a few words on Amazon Ads, we're working hard to be the best place for brands of all sizes to grow their business. We are pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $13.9 billion United States dollars of revenue in the quarter and growing 19% year-over-year. We're seeing strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel advertising offerings that help advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 275 million in the US alone. This includes our top of funnel efforts to drive brand awareness to bottom of funnel offerings where we measure outcomes at the point of conversion.\nAmazon Ads provides brands with tools to reach targeted audiences in our own entertainment properties such as Prime Video, Twitch, and IMDb, in live sports such as NFL, NBA, and NASCAR, audio content such as Amazon Music and Wondery, and of course in our store, as well as many other external sites such as Pinterest and BuzzFeed. All of our audience and measurement capabilities work for the ads we deliver across premium third party publishers through Amazon DSP. Our Secure Clean Rooms provide advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels.\nWe continue to see a lot of opportunity to further expand our full funnel capabilities for brands. AWS grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 and now sits at a $117 billion United States dollars annualized revenue run rate. We continue to help organizations of all sizes accelerate their move to the cloud helping to modernize their infrastructure, lower costs, and speed up innovation. We signed new AWS agreements with companies including Adobe, Uber, Nasdaq, Ericsson, Fujitsu, and Cargill, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, General Dynamics Information Technology, GE Vernova, Booz Allen Hamilton, NextEra Energy, Publicis Sapient, Elastic, Netsmart, and many others.\nIt's useful to remember that more than 85% of the global IT spend is still on premises, not in the cloud yet. It seems pretty straightforward to me that this equation will flip in the next 10 to 20 years. Before this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi-hundred billion dollar revenue run rate business. We now think it could be even larger if you believe your mission is to make customers' lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you're going to invest very aggressively in AI. That's what we're doing. You can see that in the thousand Plus AI applications we're building across Amazon.\nYou can see that with our next generation of Alexa named Alexa Plus. You can see that in how we're using AI in our fulfillment network, robotics, shopping, Prime Video, and advertising experiences. You can see that in the building blocks AWS is constructing for external Internal builders to build their own AI solutions. We're not dabbling here. We're very intentionally giving builders the broadest possible capabilities at every level of the AI stack, cost effectively to use AI expansively across their businesses.\nAt the bottom layer for those building models, our new custom AI chip Trainium2 is starting to land capacity in larger quantities, with significant appeal and demand while we offer customers the ability to do AI in multiple chip providers and will for as long as I can foresee customers doing AI at any significant scale realize that it can get expensive quickly. The 30% to 40 better price performance that Trainium 2 offers versus others GPU-based instances is compelling. For AI to be as successful as we believe it can be. The price of inference needs to come down significantly.\nWe consider this part of our mission and responsibility to help make it so. At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage Frontier models to build generative AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers a choice of high performing foundation models with the most compelling set of features that make it easy to build high-quality generative AI applications. We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock, adding Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet Hybrid Reasoning Model, their most intelligent model to date, and Meta's Llama 4 family of models.\nWe were also the first cloud service provider to make DeepSeek R1 and Mistral AI's Pixtral Large generally available as a fully managed model. Of course we offer our own Amazon Nova state-of-the-art foundation models in Bedrock with the latest premier model launching yesterday. They deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance, and we have thousands of customers already using them including Slack, Siemens, Sumo Logic, Coinbase, FanDuel, Glean, and Blue Origin. A few weeks ago we released Amazon Nova Sonic, a new speech-to-speech foundation model that enables developers to build voice-based AI applications that are highly accurate, expressive, and human-like.\nNova Sonic has lower word error rates and higher win rates over other comparable models for speech interactions. The technology world is also abuzz about the potential of agents. To date, virtually all the agentic use cases have been of the question answer variety. Our intention is for agents to perform wide-ranging, complex, multi-step tasks like organizing a trip or setting the lighting, temperature, and music ambience in your house. For dinner guests or handling complex IT tasks to increase business productivity, there haven't been action oriented agents like this until Alexa Plus.\nBut the technology to build these agents is still quite primitive, inaccurate and requires constant human supervision. We've just released a research preview of Amazon Nova Act, a new AI model trained to perform actions within a web browser. It enables developers to break down complex workflows into reliable atomic commands like search, checkout, or answer questions about the screen, and also enables them to add more detailed instructions to these commands where needed, like don't accept the insurance upsell.\nNova Act aims to move the current state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-step agentic actions from 30% to 60 to 90 plus with the right set of building blocks to build these action-oriented agents. At the very top of the stack are the applications. This past quarter, Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging your own data, launched a lightning-fast new agent encoding experience within the command line interface that can execute complex workflows autonomously. Customers are loving this.\nWe also made generally available GitLab Duo. With Amazon Q, enabling AI agents to assist multi-step tasks such as new feature development, code-based upgrades for Java 8 and 11, while also offering code review and unit testing, all within the same familiar GitLab platform. Our AI business has a multibillion dollar annual revenue run rate, continues to grow triple-digit year-over-year percentages, and is still in its very early days. While there is good reason for the high optimism about AI, I conclude my AWS comments with a reminder that there is still so much on premises infrastructure yet to be moved to the cloud.\nInfrastructure modernization is much less sexy too talk about than AI, but fundamental to any company's technology and invention capabilities, developer productivity, speed, and cost structure. For companies to realize the full potential of AI, they're going to need their infrastructure and data in the cloud. I want to briefly mention a few other items. As I've referenced a couple times in Q1 we introduced Alexa Plus, our next generation Alexa personal assistant, who's meaningfully smarter and more capable than her prior self, can both answer virtually any question and take actions, and is free with Prime or available to non-Prime customers for $19.99 United States dollar a month. We're just starting to roll this out.\nIn the US, we'll be expanding to additional countries later this year. People are really liking Alexa thus far. We're excited and honored to be part of the joint venture that will be creating the next generation of the esteemed James Bond film franchise. We recently named acclaimed producer Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce the next James Bond movie. Additionally, just a couple days ago, Project Kuiper reached a significant milestone by launching our first satellites into orbit, with more being launched soon, and we expect to begin offering service to customers later this year.\nI'm proud of what our teams around the world have delivered. We're excited about what we're inventing and working on as we speak. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Andy. I will begin with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $155.7 billion United States dollars, a 10% increase year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1.4 billion United States dollars headwind from foreign exchange year-over-year in the quarter. Worldwide operating income was $18.4 billion United States dollars, approximately $400 million United States dollars above the high end of our guidance range. These results include one-time charges that impacted North America and international operating income that I will discuss in a moment.\nFirst, let's start with the net sales results for these segments. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $92.9 billion United States dollars, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our international segment revenue was $33.5 billion United States dollars, also an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.Worldwide paid units grew 8% year-over-year. A priority is to provide value to our customers across our businesses.\nIn the first quarter, we held multiple deal events around the world, which drove strong customer engagement. Saw broad-based strength across our key business inputs including record delivery speeds for Prime members enabled by improved inventory placement. Our vast selection gives customers choice across various price points, particularly in categories like grocery, which includes Everyday Essentials. These are the items that people purchase most frequently. We partner with millions of independent sellers from around the world.\nThese selling partners are important contributors to our broad selection, and worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61% in Q1, consistent with Q1 of last year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5.8 billion United States dollars and International segment operating income was $1 billion United States dollars with operating margins of 6.3% in North America and 3% internationally. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we recorded one-time charges related to some historical customer returns that have not yet been resolved, and some cost to receive inventory that was pulled forward into Q1 ahead of anticipated tariffs.\nWithout these charges, North America and International operating margins would have been approximately 90 basis points and 70 basis points higher, for operating margins of 7.2% for North America and 3.7% for International. We are pleased with how our teams continue to execute and deliver for customers in Q1. Our newly re-architected inbound network drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network leading to better inventory placement, higher units per package, and as a result, lower delivery costs.\nBeyond Q1, we have a number of initiatives underway to continue improving our cost structure, such as fine tuning our inbound network, building out our same day delivery sites, expanding our rural delivery network, and adding robotics and automation to our facilities. Better inventory placement remains a top priority. Better placement drives more in stock selection, reduces travel distances and speeds up delivery. Having the inventory in the right place at the right time increases the likelihood that multiple items can be combined in a package, which helps reduce packaging and cost.\nAlthough progress won't always be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive improvement over time. Shifting to Advertising, Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. Advertising revenue grew 19% year-over-year. We're pleased with the accelerating growth on an increasingly large base. We're seeing strong adoption across our full funnel advertising offering as brands appreciate our ability to connect them with customers. We'll also continue to invest in other long term opportunities. These efforts have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon in the future.\nFuture, including Kuiper, where we had our first launch of our production design satellites earlier this week, and we'll be launching more satellites throughout the year. We're closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. We're planning for various outcomes, and we've taken a number of actions to protect the customer experience. We're doing everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense. Moving next to our AWS segment revenue was $29.3 billion United States dollar in Q1, an increase of 17% year-over-year.\nAWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $117 billion United States dollar during the first quarter. We continue to see growth in both generative AI business and non-generative AI offerings, as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the Cloud, restart or accelerate exactly existing migrations from on premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $11.5 billion United States dollars, reflects our continued growth coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business.\nAs we said before, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Plan to bring on an increasing amount of capacity in the back half of the year. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $24.3 billion United States dollar in Q1. The majority of this spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services, and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure, to support our North America and international segments.\nWe're also investing in our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth and improve delivery speeds and our cost structure. This investment will support growth for many years to come. We primarily focus our comments on operating income. I'd like to point out that our first quarter net income of $17.1 billion United States dollars includes a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion United States dollars included in non operating income and relates to our investment in Anthropic. This activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather the result of the conversion of a portion of our convertible notes to non-voting preferred stock.\nTurning to Q2 guidance, as a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities. Takes into account Q1 results, trends in quarter date results and expectations around the macroeconomic environment. Q2 net sales are expected to be between $159 billion and $164 billion, we estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately 10 basis points in the quarter. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q2 operating income is expected to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion.\nThis estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. The external environment remains complex, and as we have done throughout our history, we are focused on the inputs that we can control to protect the customer experience. We will work hard to remain the place customers trust for sharp prices, broad selection, and convenience. We'll remain focused on driving a better customer experience, and we still believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone. At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. The first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. I think I'm going to leave the China questions to others and focus on AWS and kind of AI. Andy, it seems like you've been bringing on a lot more P5 GPU instances since February from what it looks like to kind of support all these new workloads. How would you characterize in the first quarter and maybe here in the second quarter the kind of supply demand imbalance that you talked about before around AI workloads? When do you think that AWS will be in a position to kind of capture enough AI revenue to drive acceleration? Is that something that could happen this year? Do you see that more like next year, given your capacity constraints? Thank you very much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Ross. You know, I would say that we've been bringing on a lot of P5s, which is a form of NVIDIA chip instances, as well as landing more and more Trainium2 instances as fast as we can. I would tell you that, you know, our AI business right now is a multibillion annual run rate business. It's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year. We, as fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed. You know, I think we could be helping more customers and driving more revenue for the business if we had more capacity. We have a lot more Trainium2 instances and the next generation of NVIDIA's instances landing in the coming months.\nI expect that, you know, there are other parts of the supply chain that are a little bit jammed up as well, you know, motherboards and some other componentry. I do think, and some of that is just because there is so much demand right now. I do believe that the supply chain issues and the capacity issues will continue to get better as the year proceeds.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could ask a two parter. First, in terms of strategy, you know, Andy, how do you think about positioning the company for the medium term given all the levels of uncertainty out there about how the global trade environment might shift in the coming months?What do you see as the key Strategic priorities that will allow the company to sort of be able to capitalize one way or another depending on various elements of outcome? How do you prioritize those investments in the months ahead?\nWith respect to the Q4 forward operating income guide, is there anything in there from a cost side that we should be thinking about as purely aligned with those types of investments against the trade landscape that might not repeat either later into this year or next year? Thanks so much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Eric. You know, it's hard to tell what's going to happen with tariffs right now, it's hard to tell where they're going to settle and when they're going to settle. A lot of what we're thinking about short and medium term actually turns out to be what we think about long term too, which is how do we actually have the broadest possible selection for customers at the lowest possible prices. There's maybe never been a more important time in recent memory than, you know, trying to keep prices low, which we're heads down, pretty maniacally focused on, and then get things to people quickly and take care of customers. That is the heart of what we're doing. You can see different initiatives that we've taken within those priorities.\nYou know, we've done some forward buys of inventory in where we're the first party seller, our third party sellers have pulled forward a number of items, so they have inventory here as well. Those are all, you know, we're encouraging that because we're trying to keep prices as low as possible for customers. I think also when you have as broad a selection as we have, and we have much broader selection than other retailers, it means that when you've got discontinuity like we may potentially have, you're better able to help customers find what they want, no matter what those trends are. I mentioned in my opening comments about what happened in the pandemic, and you can bet they're going to be things that we don't anticipate the customers really value and want that are different.\nIt could be as simple, by the way, as just favoring other brands that maybe people didn't know about before, where they have a more favorable price equation for customers. I think another thing that people forget is that when you've got 2 million plus sellers, they're not all going to take the same strategy if there ends up being higher tariffs. I mean, there are going to be plenty of sellers that decide to pass on those higher costs to end consumers. We have a lot of sellers in lots of different countries, and not all of them are going to pursue the same tack.\nI think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that they're going to capture share and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers. I think customers are going to have a better chance of finding variety on selection and on lower prices when they come here. The last thing I would say is that we have been in a number of our businesses, but just I'd say over the last six years or so we have been diversifying where we produce things over a long period of time. We had, I would say, a meaningfully higher concentration of where we produced components for AWS or devices in China than we have now, where we've diversified meaningfully over that time.\nWe just thought that was wise to do so. Those are some of the ways that we're trying to make sure that we are protecting our customers over the short, medium, and long term. It turns out that most of those are the things that we focus most on, which is really broad selection for ultimate choice, really low prices, and very fast delivery.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nEric, I'll take a question on the guidance, especially on operating income. I think that was your question and the cost that might be in Q2. The thing I point to again is what I mentioned earlier. The stock-based comp always steps up generally in Q2 versus Q1, and then resets at a rate that carries through for the next four quarters. You can look at historic trends to get an idea of that. Secondly, we do have some additional Kuiper Launch costs in Q2. You saw a launch happen this week, and a reminder that we expense those launch costs until the point of commercialization, which would plan is to have that be later in this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. I'll go back to AWS. I know in the past you said revenues can be lumpy. Can you explain why they might fluctuate up and down? If it's beyond just capacity and you see the competitors with some pretty good growth rates, how do you think about the difference there? Obviously, your dollar growth is very good. How do you think about the difference there versus some of your competitors?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nWell, the first thing I would say when we've historically said that revenue can be lumpy, we've been saying this well before what's happened with AI over the last couple years, and the reason for that is the sales cycle, particularly for enterprises. It's true for startups. You know, what you really want is you want to have the type of capabilities where startups want to primarily choose to run on top of your platform. That's true. If you look in the startup space, the vast majority of successful startups over the last 10 to 15 years have run on top of AWS. It's unpredictable when those startups are gonna find product-market fit and grow substantially.\nIt's hard for them to predict and even harder for us to predict. The same thing goes on the enterprise side, but in a different way. The sales cycle on the enterprise side is that you spend time trying to convince people that they should move from on premises to the cloud and that you have the right solution for them. You pick a set of projects that you get experience on. Sometimes they use systems integrators, sometimes they use our own professional services, and sometimes they're doing it themselves. There's a next tranche of migrations, and those migrations just take time.\nSome companies get through them really quickly, and some companies take longer to get through them. What happens a lot of times too is that they get excited and enthusiastic about the cost advantages and the speed of innovation advantages. They get moving to the cloud, and what was supposed to be a smaller next tranche turns into a much larger next tranche. All of that has been true for a long time. It's very hard for us to predict because it really is contingent on what enterprises, how they want to sequence it and resource it. You throw in AI, which has its own very fast growth cycle, particularly in certain types of use cases, and those change.\nI mean, I'll give you just some examples. In the early days of, you know, on the earliest days, I should say, of AI, what you've seen the most amount of has been initiatives that get you productivity and cost avoidance. We've seen that from so many of our AWS customers, and we're doing a lot of it ourselves inside of Amazon using AI. You've also seen, I would say, large scale training with a lot of those running on top of this as well. As you know, Anthropic is building the next few training models on top of our Trainium2 chip on AWS. You've seen a couple really big chatbots, and what you've seen just in the last few months is really kind of the explosion of coding agents.\nIf you just look at the growth of these coding agents the last few months, these are companies like Cursor or Vercel. Both of them run significantly on AWS. Just look at the growth of that over the last few months. You just couldn't have predicted that sort of growth, and that's why it's slumpy. Sometimes you'll have very significant increases that you didn't predict and you couldn't forecast. They'll grow at a good rate, but maybe not the same rate before the next big kind of explosive growth. I would tell you that everything I just mentioned with interesting and AI is that we still haven't gotten to all the other customer experiences.\nThey're going to be reinvented, and all the other agents they're going to be built. They're going to take, you know, the role of a lot of different functions today. You know, those are there's so even though we have a lot of combined inference in those areas, I would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now. I would just say on how to think about relative growth rates, you always have to, you know, the year-over-year growth rate is really only a function of the percentage growth on the base with which you are operating from.\nWe just have a very, you know, a meaningfully larger base on the technology infrastructure side than others. When, you know, it's still, you know, if you think about 17% year-over-year growth on a $117 billion revenue run rate, still pretty significant. Said I think we could be doing more if we had more capacity, and I expect that, you know, the capacity to ease in the coming months.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking questions. One for Brian, one for Andy. Brian, just maybe to follow up on AWS, but more on the margin side. We've seen a lot of fluctuation over the last couple years, and now hitting almost 40%. Maybe you can just talk about what's driving the outperformance, and then how we should think about normalized margins going forward. Andy, your comments on Alexa about moving to more complex tasks. Can you talk about that more? Just, you know, with Alexa, the products have been around for a long time. They've had different use cases. How do you get users to shift? Their behavior more with Alexa? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Doug. I'll take your first question. Yeah, we did a strong quarter in AWS as you mentioned, the margin performance. I would attribute it to the strong growth that we're seeing, coupled with the impact of some continued investment we're making in innovation and technology. Give you some examples. We invest in software and process improvements, and it ends up optimizing our server capacity, which helps our infrastructure cost. Been developing more efficient network. Using our low-cost custom networking gear, we're working to maximize the power usage in our existing data centers, which both lowers our costs and also reclaims power for other, newer workloads.\nWe're also seeing the impact of advancing custom silicon like Graviton. It provides lower cost not only for us, but also for our customers, the better price performance for them. You're right, margins are impacted by a lot of things, including our level of investment, competitive pricing, and the mix of generative AI services as they're ramping up will continue to evolve over the years to come. We do have a lot of investment in infrastructure going on and planned for the second half of the year. That will, you know, we'll start to see the impact of that. We're happy with the performance of the team with generating cost savings, and it's a big focus, as well as expanding the services and features for customers.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nOn the Alexa question, we're really excited about Alexa and, you know, as I mentioned earlier, she is much more intelligent, much more capable, and able to take real action. You know, to date, most of the agents that have been out there have really just been able to answer questions, which, when it came out, was very remarkable. You know, I think the future of agents is not just being intelligent but also being able to take action. That's actually, it requires a great model, but it also requires the ability to sync that model and to align that model with being able to take the right action and execute and implement the right APIs, or you can have very suboptimal results.\nWe've worked hard on that in Alexa. We started rolling out over the last several weeks. It's with now over 100,000 users, you know, with more rolling out in the coming months. So far, the response from our customers has been very, very positive. People are excited about it. I think that, you know, it does a lot more things than what Alexa did before. You know, we're very fortunate in that we have over a half billion devices out there in people's homes, offices, and cars. We have a lot of distribution already. There will be, to some degree, a little bit of rewiring for people on what they can do because you get used to patterns.\nI mean, even the simple thing of not having to speak Alexa speak anymore, where we're all used to saying Alexa before we want every action to happen, and what you find is you really only have to do it the first time. Really, the conversation is ongoing, where you don't have to say Alexa anymore. I've been lucky enough to have, you know, the alpha and the beta that I've been playing with for several months, and it took me a little bit of time to realize I didn't have to keep saying Alexa. It's very freeing when you don't have to do that, you know. I think it's just experience in trying things.\nYou can do things like you have guests coming over on a Saturday night for dinner and you can say, you know, Alexa, please open the shades, put the lights on in the driveway and on the porch, increase the temperature 5 degrees, and pick music that would be great for dinner that's mellow. She just does it. Like, when you have those types of experiences, it makes you want to do more of it. You know, when I was in New York, when we were announcing it, I asked her what were the, you know, we did the event way downtown. I asked her what were, what was great Italian restaurants or pizza restaurants.\nShe gave me a list, and she asked me if she wanted me to make a reservation. I said yes, and she made the reservation, confirmed the time. Like that. When you get into those types of routines and you have those types of experience, they're very, very useful. It is really like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don't have. I think that the more and more that people get used to it, they will realize what she can do. We're not going to be standing still. We have a lot more functionality that we plan to add in the coming months too.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. Hey, Andy and Brian. I have one for each of you guys. Andy, you have a very complicated retail business with a lot of moving pieces to it. I imagine you have a lot of good data on what you expect demand to be over the course of the year, the holidays, and things. As you kind of step back and analyze the business and the tariff uncertainty, can you just sort of walk us through the one or two key areas operationally that you're most focused on just to ensure that Prime Day, Thanksgiving, and the holidays go as smoothly as they possibly can? Secondly, Brian, just to kind of go back to Eric's earlier question.\nAs we think about the Q2 EBIT guide, are there any one-time costs or sort of tariff-related costs in there similar to that billion dollars that you called out in the first quarter? Thanks.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Brian. On the retail question, I would say that the areas that maybe we're most focused on to make sure we have, you know, not just a great Prime Day, but you know, Prime Day is just one event, as you know, and so is peak. We're trying to be great all year long for customers. The obvious ones are making sure that we help our sellers however we can because there's uncertainty for our sellers as well. We're trying to make sure we provide a great experience. We're trying to make sure that we have the right diversity of sellers, and low prices for our customers. I think all that.\nYou have to also be very thoughtful around how much inventory you bring into your fulfillment nodes at any one time because you can imagine scenarios where, you know, either on your own when you're the first party seller or lots of third parties want to get as much inventory in as early as possible, you know, trying to beat a deadline on what may happen. If you end up with too much inventory in your fulfillment network, it really slows down your productivity and your ability to get things out as quickly as you want for customers at the cost structure you want. Being able to manage that thoughtfully, we've learned that over the years, and I think team is doing a really good job of balancing that right now.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nBrian, on your question about Q2, I guess I'll just reiterate what I had said earlier. You know we had stock-based comp step up, which I think you can see the normal pattern for that. If you look at our history, we have additional Kuiper expenses. Specifically, you asked about tariffs. We do have tariffs that we'll be paying on retail purchases based on current tariffs. It's not large in Q2. It's had done a lot of pre buying of inventory in Q1 as I mentioned earlier. You know, just generally I think with the uncertainty we've added a bit to the range that we've given you.\nWe generally have a wide range, but just the general uncertainty that we're seeing, and uncertainty of consumer demand and all the everything else, is causing us to increase the ranges a bit. We'll see. We feel it's an informed view of Q2 right now. As Andy mentioned earlier, we saw actually some strength in April based on what could end up being some pre buys of a number of things. Advertising has been strong. We think there's a lot of positive trends, but you know, certainly uncertainty right now for the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us the backlog number. Andy, to your point about many of these core workloads still yet to come to cloud, can you just update us and what you're seeing, are you seeing enterprise strength back? Are you seeing some confusion with, with AI clouding that transition and the timing of that. Just give us a perspective on what you're seeing on that migration.Thank you.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHey, this is Dave. I'll just jump in on the backlog and turn over to Andy. The backlog is $189 billion United States dollars for Q1. That's up about 20% year-over-year. The weighted average remaining life on that is 4.1 years.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nPresident and CEO, Amazon\n\nOn the AWS question, Brent, around what we're seeing on the workloads that haven't moved, you know what I would say, the way I would characterize it, is that we were on a very aggressive march that was methodical but almost metronomic before the pandemic of enterprises deciding that they wanted to move off their on premises infrastructure because of the speed of innovation, the developer productivity, and the cost advantages of the cloud. When you got into the pandemic and the economy looked uncertain in the second half of that few years, you had everybody trying to cost optimize, including us by the way.\nAs we started to emerge from that trend, you saw generative AI explode, and everybody wanted to try to find a way to have a workload or a set of workloads there because people saw the potential. It was also something that was generating a lot of interest publicly. What we've seen now over the last, call it 16 to 18 months or so, is that enterprises realize they need to do both and they want to do AI. They have all sorts of pilots at this point on AI, many of which will be successful, others of which will not be successful. The ones that are successful will scale, but they also have a lot more initiatives that they still haven't gotten to on the AI side, either because they're building that skill set, or they're picking the first set to get experience with, or as they're waiting to see the cost of inference continue to go down, which it will.\nI mean, you will not get the expansiveness that we all know is coming in AI until we keep getting the cost of inference down, even though it's growing like crazy right now. At the same time, I would say that we see an increased resurgence and understanding for enterprises that they are dropping the low-hanging fruit if they don't move their infrastructure to the cloud. They just, you know, for all the reasons I mentioned earlier. You're starting to see those plans pick up again. As I mentioned earlier to one of the questions, you don't decide that you're going to transform your infrastructure from on premises to the cloud and see it happen in three months.\nThat is typically a multi-year process. Some companies do it fast, some companies do it slower, but they do it in tranches, and they do it thoughtfully because they can't afford for their application not to work as they're making their transition. We're having meaningful success in those conversations and in companies choosing to transform their infrastructure on top of AWS. I think you'll see that moving forward too.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nThank you for your time joining us today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello and welcome to our Q4 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 6 February 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $187.8 billion in revenue, up 10% year over year. Given the way the dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, we saw $700 million more of foreign exchange headwind than we anticipated in guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been up 11% year over year and exceeded the top end of our guidance. Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year over year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year over year. We're pleased with the invention, customer experience improvements, and results delivered in 2024, and have a lot more planned in 2025. I'll start by talking about our stores business. We saw 10% year over year revenue growth in our North America segment and 9% year over year in our international segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates.\nOur continued focus on expanding selection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range of selection, giving customers choice across a variety of price points. We welcomed notable brands to our store throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Oura Ring, and Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners, who made up 61% of items that we sold in 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever. We also launched Amazon Haul for US customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging shopping experience that brings ultra-low-priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start. Customers continue to want Amazon to be the place they rely on for sharp pricing.\nIn the fourth quarter, consumers saved more than $15 billion with our low everyday prices, and record-setting events during Prime Big Deal Days in October, and Black Friday and Cyber Monday around Thanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth year in a row, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the US. Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another record-setting year for Prime members. We expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140 metro areas, and overall we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world. Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price, and delivery speed is driving accelerated growth in Prime membership.\nFor just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items, often the same day or one day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening of 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon Music, access to unlimited generic prescriptions for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery on orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99 a month, a free Grubhub Plus membership with free unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a $0.10 per gallon fuel discount at BP, Amoco, and AMPM stations.\nWhen you think about this as a whole, and also compared to many other membership services that are comparably or more expensively priced that offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal, and we have more coming for our Prime members in 2025. We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver of our increased operating income. We've talked about the regionalization of our US network. We've also recently rolled out our redesigned US inbound network. While still in its early stages, our inbound efforts have improved our placement of inventory so that even more items are closer to end customers. Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd improved the percentage of ordered units available in the ideal building by over 40% year over year.\nWe've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of items we send customers in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to fulfill. Our per unit transportation costs continue to decline as we build out and optimize our last mile network. Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per unit basis for the second year in a row, while at the same time increasing speed, improving safety, and adding selection. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunity to reduce costs again as we further refine inventory placement, grow our same day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the network. In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 18% year over year.\nThat's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double what it was just four years ago at $29 billion. Sponsored products, the largest portion of ad revenue, are doing well, and we see runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress and head into this year with momentum. We've made it easier to do full funnel advertising with us.\nFull funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach advertising that drives brand awareness to mid funnel where sponsored brands let companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their detail pages or brand store on Amazon, to bottom of the funnel where sponsored products help advertisers service relevant product ads to customers at the point of purchase. We make this easy for brands to sign up for and deploy across our growing advertising. We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of customer signals across our stores and media destinations. From Amazon Marketing Cloud secure clean rooms providing advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels, to our new Multi-Touch Attribution model that helps advertisers understand how their marketing is working.\nIf an advertiser uses streaming TV, display, sponsored products, and other ad types in their campaign, Multi-Touch Attribution will show the relative contribution of each to their sales. Moving on to AWS in Q4, AWS grew 19% year over year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most folks' standards, and though we expect growth will be lumpy over the next few years as enterprise adoption cycles, capacity considerations, and technology advancements impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about what lies ahead for AWS's customers and business.\nI spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out, and while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where virtually every app has generative AI infused in it, with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, and most companies having their own agents that accomplish various tasks and interact with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. We continue to believe that this world will mostly be built on top of the cloud, with the largest portion of it on AWS. To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities, all three layers of the stack. At the bottom layer, for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are the key ingredient in the compute that drives training and inference.\nMost AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future. However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly. Customers want better price performance, and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Trainium 2 just launched at our AWS re:Invent conference in December, and EC2 instances with these chips are typically 30% to 40% more price performant than other current GPU-powered instances available. That's very compelling at scale. Several technically capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, Poolside, and Qualcomm have seen impressive results in early testing of Trainium 2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build their future frontier models on Trainium 2.\nWe're collaborating with Anthropic to build Project Ray near a cluster of Trainium 2 Ultra servers containing hundreds of thousands of Trainium 2 chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of exaflops as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of Claude models. We're already hard at work on Trainium 3, which we expect to preview late in 2025, and defining Trainium 4 thereafter. Building outstanding performing chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core strength of AWS's, starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business, and now extending to Trainium and AI, and something unique to AWS relative to other competing cloud providers. The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models.\nI won't spend a lot of time in these comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy these models, except to say that SageMaker's HyperPod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across many AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint, and saves training time by up to 40%. It continues to be a differentiator, received several new compelling capabilities at RE Invent, including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level and prioritize which workloads should receive capacity when budgets are reached, and is increasingly being adopted by model builders at the middle layer for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build gen AI apps.\nAmazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers the broadest choice of high performing foundation models, with the most compelling set of features that make it easy to build a high quality generative AI application. We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock, announcing Luma AI, Poolside, and over 100 other popular emerging models to Bedrock and Reinvent in short order. We also just added DeepSeek's R1 models to Bedrock and SageMaker. Additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock features at Reinvent, including prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing, and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost and latency in their inference. Like SageMaker, AI Bedrock is growing quickly and resonating strongly with customers. Related, we also just launched Amazon's own family of frontier models in Bedrock called Nova.\nThese models compare favorably in intelligence against the leading models in the world, but offer a lower latency, lower price, about 75% lower than other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine tuning, model distillation, knowledge bases of RAG, and agentic capabilities. Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of the capabilities and price performance of Amazon Nova models, including Palantir, Deloitte, SAP, Dentsu, Fortinet, Trellix, and Robinhood. We've just gotten started at the top layer of the stack. Amazon Q is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call I shared the very practical use case where Q Transform helps save Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK.\nThis is real value, and companies asked for more, which we oblige with our recent deliveries of Q transformations that enable moves from windows.net applications to Linux, VMware to EC2, and accelerates mainframe migrations. Early customer testing indicates the QCon term was going to be a multi-year effort to do a mainframe migration into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal, and these transformations are good examples of practical AI. While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of companies' technology infrastructure from on premises to the cloud.\nWe signed new AWS agreements with companies including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, the Hertz Corporation, Redfin, Chime Financial, Asana, and many others. Consistent customer feedback from our recent AWS re:Invent gathering was appreciation that we're still inventing rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute, and database analytics. Our functionality leadership continues to expand, and there were several key launches customers were abuzz about, including Amazon Aurora DSQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications with the highest availability, strong consistency, Postgres compatibility, and four times faster reads and writes compared to other popular distributed SQL databases.\nAmazon S3 tables, which make S3 the first cloud object store with fully managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics, Amazon S3 metadata, which automatically generates queryable metadata, simplifying data discovery, business analytics, and real-time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3, and the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, which brings together all the data analytics services and AI services into one interface to do analytics and AI more easily at scale. As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and partners for their meaningful impact throughout the year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done and look forward to delivering for customers in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks Andy. Starting with our top line financial results, worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind from FX in the quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we'd anticipated in our Q4 guidance range. Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever, and was $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range across all segments. We continue to innovate for customers while operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6 billion, an increase of 10% year over year. International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nWorldwide paid units grew 11% year over year as our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping continues to resonate with customers. Shifting to profitability, North America's segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year over year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year over year. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year over year. Operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis points year over year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year over year margin improvement in both the North America and international segments. 2024 also marks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per unit basis. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network from improved inventory placement, higher units per package, and reduced travel distances.\nWe also saw improved productivity in our fulfillment centers. Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter, and particularly during our peak seasons. I want to thank them for all they do to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also allows us to deliver items to customers faster. In the US, we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same day delivery network globally. We're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time to implement and progress may not be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive improvements in our cost structure. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base.\nWe will also continue to invest in experiences that have potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term in areas like Alexa, Healthcare, and Grocery, as well as Kuiper, including the planned launches of our production satellites in the coming months. As a reminder, we currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue is $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion during the fourth quarter.\nWe continue to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI offerings as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. Customers recognize to get the full benefit of generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported operating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year. This is the result of strong growth, innovation in our software and infrastructure to drive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making.\nAdditionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q4. Now turning to our capital investments, as a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and we think that run rate will be reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including to support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth.\nWe're also investing in same day delivery facilities and our inbound network, as well as robotics and automation to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve. These capital investments will support growth for many years to come. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1, net sales are expected to be between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. I'd like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year over year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $2.1 billion in Q1 year over year, or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter, just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies. Second, a reminder that we are comping the impact of last year's leap year.\nThe extra day contributed approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024, or about 120 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments. Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18 billion. This guidance includes the estimated impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an aggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for the assets on our balance sheet as of 31 December 2024. First, in Q4 we completed a useful life study for our servers and networking equipment and observed an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nAs a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $700 million. In addition, we also early retired a subset of our servers and network equipment, recorded a Q4 2024 expense of approximately $920 million from accelerated depreciation and related charges, and expect this will also decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $600 million. Both of these server and network equipment useful life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our fulfillment centers and are increasing the useful life from 10 years to 13 years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will increase full year 2025 operating income by approximately $900 million.\nAs we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We remain focused on driving an even better customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touchtone telephone at this time. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question, Mark.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. Two quick questions. Brian, that's $100 billion CapEx we should think about in 2025. Andy, were there any, would you describe that AWS growth is being currently moderated down by supply constraints? Do you see those across the industry, or do you see those materially impacting AWS today? Thank you very much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nI'll take both those. Sandy, on the CapEx side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in CapEx in Q4, and I think that is reasonably representative of what you can expect in the annualized CapEx rate in 2025. The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS. It's, you know, the way the AWS business works and the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand.\nWhen AWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly in what we think is one of these once in a lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign medium to long term for the AWS business. I actually think that spending this capital to pursue this opportunity, which from our perspective we think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it, and with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, if you believe that, plus that altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are going to actually be available to us with AI. AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the Internet.\nI think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy medium to long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have CapEx that we're spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve. You'll see us expanding the number of same day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas so we can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly, and then a pretty significant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost served down and continue to improve our productivity. That's the CapEx piece.\nI think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. It is hard to complain when you have a multibillion dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI like we do, and it's growing triple digit percentage year over year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster if not for some of the constraints on capacity. They come in the form of, you know, I would say chips from our third party partners coming a little bit slower than before, with a lot of midstream changes that take a little bit of time to get the hardware actually yielding the percentage healthy and high quality servers we expect.\nIt comes with our own big new launch of our own hardware and our own chips and Trainium 2, which we just went to general availability at Re Invent, but the majority of the volume is coming in really over the next couple quarters and next few months. It comes in the form of power constraints, where I think the world is still constrained on power, from where I think we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply chain, like motherboards too, that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers so they can grow, grow.\nWe're still growing at a pretty reasonable clip as I mentioned earlier, but I do think we could be growing faster if we were unconstrained. I predict those constraints really start to relax in H2 2025. As I said, I think we could be growing faster even though we're growing a pretty good clip today.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner, and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. I'll just ask one that's building on Mark's questions there. Andy, when you think about the news that came out of China over the last couple of weeks and think longer term about bending the cost curve lower with AI, I understood the commentary around CapEx for 2025. When you look at where you sit in the industry, the move towards open source elements of custom silicon, how do you think about bending the cost curve and either speeding up or multiplying time, deployment to market, or possibly higher returns on capital for AI. Thanks so much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nWell, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done. I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement learning, being earlier without the human in the loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning. We also thought some of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things. We're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to come.\nYou know, I think, you know, if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads, you're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock, and it's why we move so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker, you know, faster than you saw from others. We already have customers starting to experiment with that. I think one of the interesting things over the last couple weeks is sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component.\nIn this case, we're really talking about inference that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology. We just, we have never seen that to be the case. We did the same thing in the cloud, where we launched AWS in 2006, where we offered S3 object storage for $0.15 a gigabyte and compute for $0.10 an hour, which of course is much lower. Now, many years later, people thought that people would spend a lot less money on infrastructure technology. What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses. They get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost prohibitive before, and they usually end up spending a lot in total on technology once you make the per unit cost less.\nI think that is very much what's going to happen here in AI, which is the cost of inference will substantially come down. What you heard the last couple weeks out of DeepSeek is a piece of it. Everybody is working on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI. I think it's going to, if you run a business like we do, where we want to make it as easy as possible for customers to be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost of inference coming down is going to be very positive for customers and for our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for the questions. I'll stick with AWS. To start, just. Brian, maybe you can talk a little bit more about margins there, just given that they've kind of moved between the mid-20s to high-30s over the past two years. How should we think about that more normalized, especially as you're investing that much more in generative AI? Just on the store side, can you talk about the impact of less volume going through your shipping partner UPS, going forward? Are you able to manage that incremental shipping that's required? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah, sure. Doug, thanks for your question. First on AWS, yeah, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating margin AWS. You know, we've said historically that they will be lumpy, as you say, over time. You know, the stage we're in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy investment load, as we've talked about. In the short term, over time that should be a headwind on margins, but over the long term we feel the margins will be comparable in non-AI business as well. We're very pleased with the strong growth, focus on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving power, reusing power in new generative AI applications, and just generally reducing costs. Very pleased with the performance of the AWS team and look forward to strong 2025.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nI'll take the UPS one, which is really, you know, UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that that will continue to be partners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly over the last several years, particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much larger percentage of our shipments through our own logistics network, our own last mile transportation network. I think that's in part because we needed to scale up so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut down and needing to serve more the total market segment share of retail units during that time and needing to do it at a, you know, at a low cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices, and that's the nature of the business. I think UPS has decided that serving Amazon is lower margin for them.\nI think they've walked away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're able to handle it with our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. Andy, maybe to drill a little bit into the robotics acceleration that you talked about. Any new data points, things you can share on learnings from Shreveport, and how do we think about the scalability of savings or the time that we could see a real impact on profitability from robotics? Then maybe just a bigger picture Gen AI, GPU-enabled changes. Other examples of how you see the Amazon retail shopping experience changing throughout 2025 as you're better using Gen AI or GPU-enabled machine learning and things?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, okay, well on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is since we've been pretty substantially integrating robotics into our fulfillment network over the last many years, we have seen cost savings, we've seen productivity improvements, and we've seen safety improvements. We have already gotten a significant amount of value out of our robotics innovations. What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part of what you're referencing in Shreveport, is that the next tranche of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. We've put them all together for the first time as part of an experience in our Shreveport facility. We are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there, by both the speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity improvements, and the cost to serve improvements.\nYou know, it's still relatively early days, and these are all being put together only in Shreveport at this point. We have plans now to start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new facilities, and others of which will retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations. I'll also tell you that this group of, call it a half dozen or so new initiatives, is not close to the end of what we think is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve productivity, cost to serve, and safety in our fulfillment network. We have kind of the next wave that we're starting to work on now.\nI think this will be a many year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment network where we can use robotics. We actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics on. Your other question, which is I think really about how we might use AI in other areas of the business in AWS, maybe more. I think you asked about our retail business. The way I would think about it is that there's kind of two macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon, as well as other companies using AWS, how we see them getting value out of AI today. You know, the first macro bucket I would say is really around productivity and cost savings. In many ways, this is the lowest hanging fruit in AI.\nYou see that all over the place in our retail business. You know, for instance, if you look at customer service and you look at the chatbot that we've built, we completely re-architected it with generative AI. It already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better satisfaction from customers with the new generative AI-infused chatbot. If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, you know, one of their biggest pain points is because we put a high premium on really organizing our marketplace so that it's easy to find things. There's a bunch of different fields you have to fill out when you're creating a new product detail page.\nWe've built a generative AI application for them where they can either fill in just a couple lines of text, take a picture of an image, or point to a URL, and the generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out. This speeds getting selection on the website and makes it easier for sellers. If you look at how we do inventory management and trying to understand what inventory we need and what facility at what time, the generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part and 20% better regional predictions in our robotics.\nWe were just talking about the brains in a lot of those robotics or generative AI infused that do things like tell the robotic claw what's in a bin, what it should pick up, how it should move it, where it should place it in the other bin that it's filling. It's really in the brains of most of our robotics. We have a number of very significant, I'll call it productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business. They're using generative AI, and again, it's just a fraction of what we have going. I'd say the other big macro bucket are really altogether new experiences.\nYou see lots of those in our retail business, ranging from Rufus, which is our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly, to things like Amazon Lens, where you can take a picture of a product that's in front of you, check it out in the app, and you can find it in the little box at the top. You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision generative AI to pull up the exact item in a search result, to things like sizing, where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different clothing manufacturers and then compare them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or small relative to each other. When you come to buy a pair of shoes, for instance, it can recommend what size you need.\nEven what we're doing in Thursday Night Football, where we're using generative AI for really inventive features like defensive alerts, where we predict which player is going to blitz quarterback, or defensive vulnerabilities, where we were able to show viewers what area of the field is vulnerable. We're using it really all over our retail business, and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about 1,000 different generative AI applications we've either built or in the process of building right now.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\n\nJohn Blackledge\n\nManaging Director, and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks. Could you talk about the current speed of delivery, maybe how much more room to go there, and how is it driving the everyday essentials business? Somewhat relatedly, any further color on inbound network efficiencies you would expect to see this year as you guys try to continue to lower the cost to serve. Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, I would say on speed of delivery that we measure this very carefully, and we measure both what the conversion rate is of somebody who views a product detail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that are slower, as well as what we see downstream from customers once they've bought with a fast promise and what they end up buying throughout the year. We have not yet seen diminishing returns in being able to continue to improve the speed of delivery. It doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. You know, we have a program where if people want to pick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and have it delivered, then to be more sustainable and more environmentally friendly, they can.\nWe have plenty of customers who choose that. We time in and time out see that people choose to buy from us more frequently when we're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly. It leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can deliver more quickly. I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime Air, you know, the promise there is for a number of items that will be able to deliver items to customers inside an hour. I think when you're ordering everyday essentials where you need something more quickly, it's a big deal. You see it. It's had a big impact on our everyday essentials.\nIt's had a big impact on our pharmacy business, where people are able to get items same day now in lots of cities throughout the US, and they're just using us much more frequently than they had before. On the inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is we've made a pretty significant architectural change in our inbound network that we've been working on for the better part of a year, that we rolled out just a few months ago. Again, what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get some low-hanging fruit efficiencies early, but then there's all sorts of tuning and refinement you have to do.\nOnce you actually see it working live across the really vast network, we have all sorts of ways here where I think it's early, and I think we're going to get additional efficiencies throughout the year. I expect that we'll have opportunities to keep taking our cost of serve down this year, and that'll be a big part of it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Morton\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you so much for the question. I wanted to follow up on Andy's remarks about how you're using AI within the Amazon e-commerce experience. I wanted to talk about the other side of the coin, and that's really the e-commerce discovery process that leads people to Amazon. There's a lot of companies rolling out agents and assistants, and I would love to hear how Amazon is planning for potential disruption in this funnel and what the plans are. You spoke about Rufus, maybe make that more prominent. What you think the changes coming to the e-commerce funnel over the next several years would be great?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nWell, I would say that I think retailers ourselves, and probably lots of other retailers, are all going to have their own say on how they want to interact with agents. I think it's an emerging space. If you think about the investments that we've made in our fulfillment network, in our website, in all the selection that we've built, how we organize it, you know, most retailers are going to have kind of terms in which they're going to interact with agents, and we'll be no different that way. I think that, I do think that Rufus, if you look at how it impacts the customer experience, and if you actually use it month to month, it continues to get better and better.\nIt's already, if you're buying something and you're on a product detail page, our product detail pages provide so much information that sometimes it's hard if you're trying to find something quickly to scroll through and find that little piece of information. We have so many customers now who just use Rufus to help them find a quick fact about a product. They also use Rufus to figure out how to summarize customer reviews so they don't have to read 100 customer reviews to get a sense of what people think about that product. If you look at the personalization, really most prominently today, your ability to go into Rufus and ask what's happened to an order, or what did I just order, or can you pull up for me this item that I ordered two months ago, the personalization keeps getting much better.\nWe expect throughout 2025 that the number of occasions where you're not sure what you want to buy and you want help from Rufus are going to continue to increase and be more and more helpful to customers.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on the investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.\nOur results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $51.4 billion, up 664%, or $44.7 billion year-over-year. As I think about what matters to customers long-term, and therefore to Amazon, there's a lot to like about what we're seeing. Starting with AWS, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2.\nWe're continuing to see three macro trends drive AWS growth. First, companies have completed the significant majority of their cost optimization efforts and are focused again on new efforts. Second, companies are spending their energy again on modernizing their infrastructure and moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud.\nThis modernization enables builders to save money, innovate at a more rapid clip, and drive productivity in most companies' scarcest resources, developers. This is the flip I've talked about in the past, where the vast majority of global IT spend today is on-premises, and we expect that to keep inverting over time. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner ecosystem, AWS continues to be customers' partner of choice and the biggest beneficiary of this flip from on-premises to the cloud.\nThird, builders and companies of all sizes are excited about leveraging AI. Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days, but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers.\nAt the heart of this strategy is a firmly held belief, which we've had since the beginning of AWS, that there is not one tool to rule the world. People don't want just one database option, or one analytics choice, or one container type. Developers and companies not only reject it, but are suspicious of it. They want multiple options for flexibility, and to use the best tool for each job to be done. The same is true in AI. You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow would be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it.\nThe same one model or one chip approach dominated the earliest moments of the generative AI boom, but we have a lot of data that suggests this is not what customers want here either, and our AWS team is determined to deliver choice and options for customers. You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we're building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack.\nAt the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\nThe second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling in price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money.\nThat's what Amazon SageMaker does so well, including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods, that changes the game in networking performance for large models. We're increasingly seeing model builders standardize on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else's frontier model, customize it with their own data, and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities.\nThis is what we think of as the middle layer, what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG, and agenting, and makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 models, which are the best-performing models on the planet, Meta's new Llama 3.1 models, and Mistral's new Large 2 models.\nLlama's and Mistral's impressive performance benchmarks in Open Nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data.\nAmazon Q has the highest known score on acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development teams time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about.\nFor instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years, burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious, though important, work. With Amazon Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost. That's a game changer.\nThink about how this Amazon Q transformation capability might evolve to address other elusive but highly desired migrations. During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined. This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customers.\nFor perspective, we've added over $2 billion in advertising revenue year-over-year, and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Sponsored ads drive the majority of our advertising revenue today, and we see further opportunity there. Even with this growth, it's important to realize we're at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising.\nIn May, we made our first appearance at the upfronts and were encouraged by the agency and advertiser feedback on the differentiated value we offer across our content, reach, signals, and ad tech. With ads and Prime Video, the exciting opportunity for brands is the ability to directly connect advertising that's traditionally been focused on driving awareness, as is the case for TV, to a business outcome like product sales or subscription signups.\nWe're able to do that through our measurement and ad tech, so brands can continually improve the relevance and performance of their ads. While ads have become the norm in streaming video, we aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. Of course, for customers preferring an ad-free experience, we offer that option for an additional $2.99 a month.\nIn our stores business, we saw a growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 10% year-over-year in the international segment. A few notes on our North America revenue growth rate. First, last quarter's leap day added about 100 basis points of year-over-year growth. Second, we're seeing lower average selling prices, or ASPs, right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can.\nMore discretionary higher ticket items like computers, electronics, or TVs are growing faster for us than what we see elsewhere in the industry, but more slowly than we see in a more robust economy. Our continued faster delivery speed is earning us more of our customers' everyday essentials business. Third, our seller fees are a little lower than expected given the behavior changes we've seen from our latest fee changes.\nWhile some of these issues can press short-term revenue, we generally like these trends. While consumers are being careful on price, our North America unit growth is meaningfully outpacing our sales growth, as our continued work on selecting low prices and delivery is resonating. So far this year, our speed of delivery for Prime customers has been faster than ever before, with more than 5 billion units arriving the same day or next day.\nAs more customers experience our fast delivery, they look to Amazon for more of their shopping needs, and the continued acceleration of our everyday essentials business is an example of this phenomenon. On seller fees, lowering apparel fees has spurred substantial year-over-year unit growth in apparel.\nThe incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money where they save us effort and money is getting more traction than we'd even hoped. These collective developments will benefit customers in the form of better selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speed. There's no shortage of ideas aimed at improving the experience for stores' customers.\nFor instance, we're adding even more value to Prime, recently introducing free restaurant delivery in many of our geos, expanding Amazon Pharmacy's RxPass to Medicare members. This is a benefit that gives subscribers all-you-can-consume access to the most common generic medications for just $5 a month, and offering a grocery subscription to help save on grocery items when shopping our US and UK fresh stores. As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve.\nWe have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network. With more optimal inbound inventory placement, we expect to enable faster speeds, consolidate more orders in one box, and reduce inventory transfers once items reach a fulfillment center.\nThese cost improvements will not happen in one quarter or one fell swoop. They take technology and process innovation, with a lot of outstanding execution, but we see a path to continuing to lower our cost to serve, which, as we've discussed in the past, has very meaningful value for customers in our business. As we lower our cost to serve, we can add more low ASP selection that we can support economically, which, coupled with our fast delivery, puts Amazon in the consideration set for increasingly more shopping needs for customers.\nA few other comments about areas in which we're investing. We remain very bullish on the medium to long-term impact of AI in every business we know and can imagine. The progress may not be one straight line for companies. Generative AI, especially, is quite iterative, and companies have to build muscle around the best way to solve actual customer problems.\nWe see so much potential to change customer experiences. We see it in how our generative AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, is helping customers make better shopping decisions. We see it in how our AI features that allow customers to simulate trying apparel items are changing the buying experience. We see it in how our generative AI listing tool is enabling sellers to create new selection with a line or two of text versus the many forms previously required.\nWe see it in our fulfillment centers across North America, where we're rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses a combination of generative AI and computer vision to uncover defects before products reach customers. We see it in how our generative AI is helping our customers discover new music and video. We see it in how it's making Alexa smart.\nWe see it in how our custom silicon and services like SageMaker and Bedrock are helping both our internal teams and many thousands of external companies reinvent their customer experiences and businesses. We are investing a lot across the board in AI, and we'll keep doing so as we like what we're seeing and what we see ahead of us. We also continue to like the progress in Prime Video.\nOur storytelling is resonating with our hundreds of millions of monthly viewers worldwide, and the 62 Emmy nominations Amazon MGM Studios recently received is another supporting data point. We recently debuted titles like Fallout, the second most watched original title ever for Prime Video, The Idea of You, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in the first two weeks on Prime Video, and Season 4 of The Boys, which reached number one on Prime Video in 165 countries in its opening two weeks. We continue to see momentum in live sports.\nWe recently announced 11-year landmark deals with the NBA and the WNBA. When combined with our original films and shows, partner streaming services, licensed content, and rent-or-buy titles, Prime Video continues to evolve into the best destination for streaming video.\nFor Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite constellation, we're accelerating satellite manufacturing at our facility in Kirkland, Washington. We've announced a distribution agreement with Vreo, who distributes DirecTV Latin America and Sky Brazil, to offer Project Kuiper satellite broadband network to residential customers across seven countries in South America. We continue to field significant demand for the service from enterprise and government entities.\nWe expect to start shipping production satellites late this year and continue to believe this could be a very large business for us. I could go on, but we'll stop here. There's a lot to feel optimistic about over the next several years, and the team collectively remains focused on continuing to invent and deliver for our customers and the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Andy. Let's start with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $148 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter, which is about $300 million higher than we'd anticipated in our Q2 guidance range. Worldwide operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $14.7 billion, which was $700 million above the high end of our guidance range.\nAcross all of our segments, we remain focused on managing costs in a way that allows us to continue innovating and investing in areas that we think could move the needle for our customers. Starting with the North America and international segments, customers continue to respond positively to our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping offers. We delivered at our fastest speeds ever so far this year, which helps drive strength in areas like our everyday essentials.\nThese include items like non-perishable foods, as well as health, beauty, and personal care items. Prime members continue to increase their shopping frequency, while growing their spend on Amazon. Overall unit sales grew 11% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rates in Q1 after you adjust for the approximately 100 basis point impact of the leap year.\nNorth America segment revenue was $90 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $31.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America segment operating income was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. If we look at profitability of the core North America stores business, we actually improved our margin again quarter over quarter in Q2.\nThe overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased Q2 spend in some of our investment areas, including Kuiper, where we're starting to manufacture satellites we'll launch into space in Q4. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, driven by our efforts to place inventory more regionally, closer to where our customers are.\nThis resulted in more consolidated shipments, with higher units per box shipped. We also saw packages traveling shorter distances to customers, and this also led to better on-road productivity in our transportation network. Our international segment was profitable again in Q2, with operating income of $300 million and improvement of $1.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 0.9%, up 390 basis points year-over-year. This increase is primarily driven by our established countries, as we improve our cost structure with better inventory placement, and more consolidated shipments.\nAdditionally, our emerging countries continue to expand their customer offerings, leverage their cost structure, and invest in expanding Prime benefits. We are pleased with the overall progress of these countries as they make strides on their respective paths to profitability. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments, and we saw strong growth on an increasingly larger revenue base this quarter. We continue to see opportunities that further expand our offering in areas that are driving growth today, like sponsored products, as well as newer areas like Prime Video ads.\nMoving next to our AWS segment, revenue is $26.3 billion, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion. During the second quarter, we saw continued growth across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\nWe saw companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $4 billion year-over-year. It's driven by our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring. Additionally, AWS operating margin includes an approximately 200 basis point favorable impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers that we instituted in Q1.\nAs we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI. Now let's turn our attention to capital investments.\nAs a reminder, we define these as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the first half of the year, CapEx was $30.5 billion. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year. The majority of this spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads.\nFor the third quarter specifically, I'd highlight a few seasonal factors to keep in mind. First, we hosted another successful Prime Day in mid-July. It was our 10th Prime Day and was our largest ever. Prime members globally saved billions of dollars on deals across every product category.\nFrom a profitability perspective, we've historically seen a headwind to operating margin in Q3, driven by Prime Day deals, as well as the marketing spend surrounding the event. Additionally, in Q3, we also began to ramp up our capacity to handle Q4 holiday volumes in our fulfillment network. Lastly, we expect an increase in digital content costs quarter over quarter from the return of our NFL Thursday Night Football. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your hands to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we pull for questions. And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question and thanks for all the detail in the prepared remarks. Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last couple of weeks of earnings of the potential to overinvest as opposed to underinvest in AI as a broad team. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that in terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for basic cadence of investment by the AWS as a segment?\nAnd the second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon, both from a pace of investment and then more broadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is I think one of the least understood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business.\nIf you think about the fact that we have about 35 regions, and think of a region as a cluster of multiple data centers, and then about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data center, sometimes it includes multiple. If you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of those availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult.\nIf you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really nobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. Most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually deliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful, and you don't like the returns of the operating income.\nI think you can tell from having we disclose both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. We have built models over a long period of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. We've done the same thing on the AI side. Now, AI is newer, and it's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. I mean, it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a training cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day. You have a very significant advanced signal when you have customers that want to take down a lot of capacity.\nWhile the models are more fluid, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity signals and models, and we also are getting a lot of signal from customers and what they need. I think that the reality right now is that while we're investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean, we have a lot of demand right now, and I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, it's really interesting what's happened here, and it's also our strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years.\nWhen we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel on the generalized CPU space. What we found from customers is that when you find an offering that is really high value for you and high return, you do not actually spend less, even though you are spending less per unit. You spend less per unit, but it enables you and frees you up to do so much more inventing and building for your customers.\nWhen you are spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you are getting. A lot of times, it is hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you are learning from your customers and you push that envelope yourself. We built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we are on our fourth model right now.\nThat has been very successful for customers and for our AWS business as it saves customers up to about 30% to 40% in price performance versus the other leading x86 processors that they could use. We saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space, in the GPU space, where the products are good, but there was really primarily one provider, and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. Our customers really want improved price performance all the time.\nThat's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip, and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which we're on second versions of both of those. They will have very compelling relative price performance. In a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply is scarce, and all the schedules continue to move over time.\nCustomers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip our custom silicon, and we're producing it as fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has. I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative to others.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey math look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting, or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how do we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter X shipping?\nThe second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost-to-serve improvements and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about executing on that? Is there a timeline to deliver on that?\nSort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years versus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years?\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah, Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. If you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion to stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. That's impacting, to some extent, all three segments.\nEven with that stock-based comp step-up, the stores part of the North America segment increased the margin again last quarter. We're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve, as well as improvement in speed, added selection, and better safety. A lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some of our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. That's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter. Things like Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters.\nThe one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it, is Kuiper is stepping up a bit in Q2 versus Q1 as we start to build satellites that will launch in Q3 and Q4 this year.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nAnd your second question, Brian, I continue, and the team continues, to believe that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. As I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to happen in one quarter. It's not going to happen in one fell swoop. It's going to take work over a long period of time.\nI think that one of the silver linings, if you will, about a year and a half ago and the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost-to-serve challenges that we had was it really forced us to reevaluate everything in the network and really even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. What it did was it unveiled a number of opportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost-to-serve down.\nThe first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the regionalization of the US network. I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first architected it, we're still not done fully honing it.\nare a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that US regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower cost-to-serve. At the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our costs down while also improving the customer experience.\nOne of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our cost-to-serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able to get items to customers. We have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also going to lower our cost-to-serve and get items more close to end users, and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers.\nWe have a number of things that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well. A lot of customers like that better because it's better for the environment having more units per box. I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. Strategically and philosophically, just two other things, as you were alluding to that question.\nI think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means that we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. There are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items, that we don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve.\nAs we work hard and make progress like we are on lowering our cost to serve, that allows us to add more selection. We see this time in and time out, that when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more of their purchases, and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing too I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I really ever seen it this way in the history of the company.\nI've been here 27 years, but we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on trying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business, they're just different people working on those businesses.\nOur stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection, keeping prices low, speeding up our delivery times, and driving our cost to serve down, while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 to 500 million households around the world who do not have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted today with broadband connectivity. They are not going to be binary. We are going to work on both at the same time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHey, thanks. I'll ask two questions. AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago, those sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? Secondly, I just want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like just anecdotally, I've seen you lean in more into marketing for that, and survey work suggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you, and is it at a point where you feel like you've moved beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you.\nOn the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at a $105 billion revenue run rate at this point.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nI do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this march where most companies were trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save money, invent more quickly, and get better developer productivity.\nThen the pandemic happened, people were in survival mode, and a difficult economy came, and people were trying to save money. We just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low-hanging fruit here? I mean, it makes—I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly for my customers if I'm using the cloud.\nAWS, with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance, and security, which really matters to customers as well, and a deeper partner ecosystem, continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. As I said, we kind of sometimes look at it and say, it's interesting that we have a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early.\nIf we look at the amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over time, and we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years.\nI think that one other thing I would say about that too, Mark, is that the business today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business. About 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. I also think that generative AI itself and AI as a whole, it's going to be really large. I mean, it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be.\nUnlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all this infrastructure that's been built on premises over a long period of time and working with customers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way, in the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast, and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow.\nOn the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're seeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers. I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a pharmacy offering from our retail business.\nI think a lot of what you see—and the business has grown really quickly—a lot of what you've seen is that the work that the team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy.\nWe, especially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical store, if you walk into pharmacies in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you, and a lot of shoplifting going on in the store.\nThe combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us continuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members. That program allows customers and members to be Prime members to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month.\nWe continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have them in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York today, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. We're seeing a lot of growth there, and we're very optimistic about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOn AWS, I'm curious if you had a backlog number you could share for the quarter. I guess, Andy, when you think about getting the data state ready, I know AI today is early, but when you see most of these companies are having to move to public cloud, are you seeing a step up and a return to workloads moving to get ready for this data state, even if they're not ready to adopt AI? What are you seeing in those sales motions? Thank you.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHey, this is Dave. I'll just start off just to give you the backlog figure. At the end of the second quarter, it was $156.6 billion. That's up about 19% year over year.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nOn the second part of your question, Brent, what I would say is that it's true in analytics, but it's even maybe more so true in AI, which is that it's quite difficult to be able to do AI effectively if your data is not organized in such a way that you can access that data and run the models on top of them, and then build the application. When we work with customers—and this is true both when we work directly with customers as well as when we work with systems integrator partners—everyone's in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI. One of the first questions that we ask is, show us where your data is. Show us what your data lake looks like.\nShow us how you're going to access that data. There's very often work associated with getting your data in the right shape and in the right spot to be able to do generative AI. Fortunately, because so many companies have done the work to move to the cloud, there's a number of companies who are ready to take advantage of AI, and that's where we've seen a lot of the growth. Also, it's worth remembering that, again, remember the 90% of the global IT spend being on premises. There are a lot of companies who have yet to move to the cloud who will, and the ability to use AI more effectively is going to be one of the many drivers in doing so for them.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Blackledge\n\nAnalyst, TD Securities\n\nGreat. Two questions. First, the AWS OP income margins were strong again, mid-30% area. Just kind of what were the key drivers, and how should we think about AWS margins in the back half of the year? The international OP income margin stepped down a bit. Q over Q, just curious about that. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYes. Thank you, John. Let me start with AWS profitability. Yes, the margin is in the mid-30% range in Q2. It's up from the mid-20% range last year. You're seeing the impact of a number of cost reductions that we've made, and efficiencies we've driven in the business. There's also an adjustment that we made to the useful life of servers that happened in Q1, talked about last quarter, that contributed about 200 basis points of margin year over year. We continue to work on the cost structure.\nAs we've said in the past, the operating margin will fluctuate. It'll be lumpy quarter to quarter. We continue to work to build new products that attract new customers, and work on our efficiencies. Second question was.\n\nJohn Blackledge\n\nAnalyst, TD Securities\n\nInternational segment margin.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. This is Dave. Just real quick on that. You mentioned we're at about $300 million profit for the quarter. That is up about 390 basis points year on year from a margin perspective. As we talked about in the past, there's a number of countries at different stages of existence and maturity there. I think you're seeing continued progress, certainly on a year-over-year basis, with both our established countries.\nThe UK, Germany, and Japan, in particular, being sizable contributors to that business, continued improvement and build-out there, similar to the factors we talked about with the US, focused on operational efficiency while expanding the customer experience. In the emerging countries, as we've said over the past several quarters, we launched about 10 countries over the last seven years, really focused on, again, expanding that customer experience, building out the Prime member benefits while building scalable solutions for customers. I think in both that established and emerging areas, seeing good progress year over year and working for further improvement there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. You factored in some macro and discretionary pressures into your Q2 guide, especially in Europe. I think you called out computers, electronics, and maybe TVs in Q2 as well. I'm just curious, were the macro trends generally as you expected, or did you see softening through the quarter? How does that influence your Q3 outlook? Separately, Brian, can you help us quantify the incremental investment around Kuiper that you talked about? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. Sure. Thank you, Doug. The macro factors, if I step back, I think Andy discussed it earlier as well. We're seeing a lot of the same consumer trends that we have been talking about for the last year: consumers being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower ASP products, looking for deals. That continued into Q2, and we expect it to continue into Q3. We're seeing signs of it continuing in Q3.\nThe difference in Q2 was that, again, we had very strong unit volume growth. We actually slightly accelerated when you adjust for leap year in North America unit growth in Q2. The drop in revenue growth sequentially was tied to ASP and both continuation of existing trends, but also, as we talked about, growth in our everyday essentials business and categories.\nWhile we think we are selling a number of higher ticket items, certainly, and holding up well in the market itself, certainly not as strong as it's been in a normalized economy. Lower ASP products are more of the mix right now. We like that because, again, our speed allows us to deliver, especially everyday essentials, quickly. We like being in the consideration set for consumers on those items. We're not going to quantify Kuiper today, but thank you for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon.com\n\nHello and welcome to our Q1 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30th 2024 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filing.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion, and $48.8 billion in trailing 12 month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers, while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making, starting with our stores business. Despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want.\nFor instance, in the US we recently welcomed Clinique and two Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our Gen AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.\nAs our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can, and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the US. We also held Spring Deal Days in Europe, and a Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members' orders arrived the same or next day, and globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about three out of four items were delivered the same or next day.\nFaster delivery times have another important effect as we get items to customers this fast. Customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing, and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us over the past year. We've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our costs.\nWhen we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries. A better customer experience reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our US inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remains strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by Sponsored Products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our Sponsored Products, as well as areas where we're just getting started, like Prime Video Ads.\nPrime Video Ads offers brands values we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription signups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads, but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS, year-over-year, revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. Given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter over quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives.\nBefore the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovate at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit of modernizing their infrastructure, and with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem, and strongest security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging Gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion dollar revenue run rate already. You've heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities in all three layers of the Gen AI stack.\nAt the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon Trainium and Inferentia is quite high, given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium 2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity.\nPerplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under seven months using SageMaker. This changes how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker. The middle layer of this stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch, but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model or LLM, customize it with their own data, and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure, high quality, low latency, cost effective production gen AI apps.\nThis is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers, but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand models' knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multi-step tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including Adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair, and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best performing models on the planet right now, Meta's Llama 3 models, Mistral's various models, Cohere's newest models, and new first-party Amazon Titan models.\nA week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality, production-grade gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their application. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these two linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing.\nThe top of the stack are the gen AI applications being built. Today we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for software development and leveraging companies' internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code, it also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure, and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting and refactoring code, to performing software upgrades.\nDevelopers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature, such as asking it to create an Add to Favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files, and suggest some new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks, and test suites. It's quite handy on the internal data side. Most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3, and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access.\nIt makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories and it'll search all this data, summarize, logically analyze trends, and engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called QApps, which lets employees describe in natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data, and QApps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance.\nQ is the highest known score on acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slalom, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q. We've only been in beta till today. I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these Gen AI services. It's less sexy, but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps.\nIf you've been paying attention to what's been happening the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS's re-accelerating growth, and high demand for gen AI, to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which, given the way the AWS business model works, is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power, and hardware.\nAs a reminder, we spend most of the capital up front, but as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out, and we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish in AWS. We're at $100 billion plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on premises, and this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There's a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability.\nOur third party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon Shipping, and Multi-Channel Fulfillment continues to grow. Well, we just launched a Prime Delivery Grocery benefit that lets customers receive free, unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value, and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new, smaller Whole Foods Market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop.\nPrime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of the very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content. Our health services business is growing robustly, as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in eight cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. Customers are now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide, and Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity.\nI'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nThanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results, worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the US dollar more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million, or 50 basis point, headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range.\nWorldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all three reportable segments, and better than expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the International segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events.\nWe added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points. year-over-year, we saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates.\nIn our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements, and improve volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability. Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improve profitability in our worldwide stores business, while still investing to improve the customer experience within our fulfillment network. We are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place, and we like the path we are on.\nAdvertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today, like Sponsored Products, and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads. Moving to AWS, revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries, as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish.\nWhile there will always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business.\nWe remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including Generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both Generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. Still, relatively early days in Generative AI and, more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including Generative AI.\nTurning to our revenue guidance for Q2, net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe, where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the US. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step up in stock based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle.\nI want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone. At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. Probably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about Gen AI and capital intensity, or grocery, or Kuiper, or healthcare, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nHi Doug. Yeah, we have historically always mentioned that you have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. If you look at the progress we made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now. Advertising has been growing strong, AWS has been strong, and you saw AWS margins increase 800 basis points sequentially off Q4.\nA lot of that's driven by cost controls, expanding revenue on the top line, and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the CapEx side, that we will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx, and the majority of that will be to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. I would expect that that will, you know, increase. It will increase depreciation definitely in that segment. When we're talking about CapEx right now in Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. Those signals, you know, are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area.\nAs he also mentioned, you know, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources up front, we create capacity very carefully for our customers, and then we see the revenue, operating income, and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that with strong returns on invested capital. A little bit of long-winded answer to your question, but yes, we have. The main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional CapEx, and we've talked about that, and we continue to see strong CapEx performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases in addition to our same day fulfillment network and some Amazon logistics upgrades to the fleet. For the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nYeah, I just would add briefly, just summarize, I understand where the question's coming from, Doug, and I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses in the stores business, along with advertising and AWS, there's a lot of growth in front of us, and I think we're investing in a meaningful way. I think we also, as we've been pretty consistent about, don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side. Yeah, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business that we're still 85% plus of the global IT spend is on premises.\nIf you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us. That's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time. For sure since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet. You know, unlike in the cloud where so much, there's a lot of work to be done to move from on premises to the cloud. People do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. It's work.\nAll of this generative AI set of workloads which will transform every experience are going to be built from scratch on the cloud, largely, and it's just tremendous opportunities there, along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. I think it's both for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey guys, somewhat related question on CapEx intensity in AWS. I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that the next generation of models cost in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Claude 4, I guess, high end. The generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. Is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in house needs to kind of stay at the state of the art, or can others do that? How much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in Q1 for AWS revenue? Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nWell Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of three, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS's performance at least in the last quarter. First of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. I think the lion's share, the cost optimization, is behind us. I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would at a macro level describe as modernizing their infrastructure, and then trying to drive value out of generative AI on the former.\nI think we were on this march before the pandemic where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on premises to the cloud because it's more cost effective, it's faster to innovate, and they get real developer productivity. The pandemic hit, people were in survival mode, and the uncertain economy led people to save costs wherever they could. They got distracted on that, but they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low hanging fruit for them. We see very significant growth in that space, and at the same time we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. You know, I mentioned we have a multi billion dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days.\nI think that there's, you know, at a high level, a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. These range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months are building new models. Those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. A lot of those are being built on top of AWS. I expect increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security, as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. You know, if you take Anthropic as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium.\nI think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS. I think that the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production. When you see the significant run rates, you spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spitting out predictions and inferences all the time. We also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS.\nA lot of that has to do with the services. You know, the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around, and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high quality, cost effective, low latency, production grade generative AI application. We see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. You layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models, and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets, data, and it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications.\nIf you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or two, not all the providers have the same track record, and we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side. As companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on cost to serve. I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple years and what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that. The second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more CapEx. Just remind us again how you sort of think through the philosophy of returning capital to shareholders in addition to continue to invest for the long run. Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nBrian. This is Brian. I will start with your second question. As far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we do not have anything to share with you on that today. You know, I will reacquaint you with our general philosophy. Our first priority is to invest in, to support the growth opportunities, and long-term investments within our businesses. Generally, we still have many opportunities for that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI. You know, we are very, we have a great deal of passion on that, and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for two years, 2021 and 2022, immediately after the pandemic.\nAs you know, we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest or highest free cash flow ever, and as trends have carried into Q1, we feel good about the free cash flow. We are again still anticipating higher CapEx this year. The other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We had reached a high water mark at the end of Q1 last year, and since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. That's our first priority as well as 2024 capital expenditures, but otherwise nothing to share on that front.\nI'll tee up Andy on the storage profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends? I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic and we say, first we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. We're not quite there yet, but we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process, and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. It's working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\n\nYoussef Squali\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Internet and Media Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Andy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon Supply Chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? Does that require step function increasing in CapEx? Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with the business we're building in third party logistics. It really kind of in some ways mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in, AWS being an example of it. Even though they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities, we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs, and we decided to build services out of them. As our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border, and then ship them from that point to various facilities.\nIt turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. You'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive, and then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers need replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities, and so on. All of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be able to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. We built that capability for ourselves first, and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers.\nWe help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones. We allow them to store items in our upstream, low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship, or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them, where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon, or to their end customers. You know, we obviously have Buy with Prime, where we enable our Prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party Buy with Prime sellers' websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own.\nIt's a great benefit for our Prime customers. You know, I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned. That makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable-sized business, and I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us. We have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can. It will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers.\nOur third party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves, and they save money in the process.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. I'd like to ask a couple growth drivers that you mentioned. First, Grocery, it seems like, you know, you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your growth right now? Do you think you're over the hump? Are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you, and then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? Do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward? Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nYeah, I'll take them in opposite order. Just on Prime Video Ads, very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies. I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising in Prime Video Ads is unique for them. It's off to a very good start. It's early days, but we're optimistic there. On grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components.\nWe have a very significant non-perishables grocery business, much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables, canned goods, pet food, healthcare, and beauty products that continue to grow at a very rapid rate. We have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space, and that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new, smaller format in the fall in Manhattan in the Whole Foods Market Daily Shop idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that has taken shape, you know. If you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve, you have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence.\nThat's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh. We've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. You know, and then we'd have to decide the best way to roll those out over time. As you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is all you can eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself, or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start.\nYou know, we have a lot, in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. We have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. I continue to be optimistic that that's going to continue to grow for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRon Josey\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability just after Q1's 2.8% margin. Talk to us just about where we are in terms of international getting to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift. We saw that average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 km and whatnot. If you can provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to continued benefits on faster shipping, same day, next day, et cetera. Thank you, Andy.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nHey Ron, I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. Yes, in the quarter our operating income was $902 million. If you watch that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment. It's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. We like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the UK, are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are, you know, adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery, they're adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. The second group is the emerging countries. Of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last seven years.\nEach of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times our Prime Video benefits help with that. We work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising and other things. Eventually, what we see is countries break even and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the positive contribution to the international segment. We are seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory, and I think you'll see more of that as we move forward.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com",
    "content2": "Yeah, I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us, and I really like the direction it's headed. I'll take also just the second part of your question, just really around continuing to take to work on cost structure. I'd say, you know, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that.\nA lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the US was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which in many ways is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another. I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the US that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places, a good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple places, and then we took, you know, we spent a lot of effort, time, and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places.\nWe believe we could be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. You know, part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way. We added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. We're seeing very optimistic signs there too. I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network.\nI think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher costs. That is not the case. If you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks, the way we have over the last couple years, and our same day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network, we still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the US and that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will again both change our cost structure while increasing speed. I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in one year.\nWe're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon.com\n\nThank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello and welcome to our Q4 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 1 February 2024 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year over year. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year over year, or $10.5 billion, and $35.5 billion in trailing twelve month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year over year. While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting, and reimagining from teams across Amazon. Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business, where customers responded to our continued focus on selection, price, and convenience.\nWe continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secret, Pit Viper, and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour merch, to cosmetics from Lancôme, Urban Decay Cosmetics, and N?E Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost Infinite and Whoop, to homewares from Martha Stewart. Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever.\nThese events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter, customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the US and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the US, this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the US in the fourth quarter we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year over year.\nAs we're able to get customers items this fast, it increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs, and we can see that in all sorts of areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing. Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down, which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the US, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost to serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices, or ASPs, and profitably. We have a saying, it is not hard to lower prices, and it's hard to be able to afford low earned prices.\nThe same is true with adding selection. It's not hard to add lower ASP selection. It's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASP selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases. As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism. There's more upside for us. Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year over year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the US.\nA self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engaged viewers on Twitch, FreeVee, Fire TV, and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the US, as well as Thursday Night Football. Shifting to AWS, revenue in the quarter grew 13% year over year in Q4 versus 12% year over year in Q3, and we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter, and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion in incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX-neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell.\nWhile cost optimization continued to attenuate, larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, Nvidia, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cathay, BYD, Accor, Amgen, and SAIC. Our customer pipeline remains strong as existing customers are renewing at larger commitments over longer periods, and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for Generative AI or GenAI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we're deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute, where the chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with Nvidia chips.\nWe also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performant than other x86 alternatives. As a result, we've built custom AI training chips named Trainium and inference chips named Inferentia. At Re:Invent, we announced Trainium 2, which offers 4x faster training performance and 3x more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.\nIn the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS security and other features, all as a managed service, we've launched Bedrock, which is off to a very strong start with many thousands of customers using the service. After just a few months, the team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models, knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, and real-time queries, agents to complete multi-step tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models, all of which will help customers' applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences. We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama 2, Stability AI, and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs.\nWhat customers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there's meaningful iteration required in building a production GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. At the top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early GenAI applications.\nAs a coding companion at re:Invent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one, and can also query customers' various data repositories like intranets, wikis, or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, or Zendesk, among others, and answer questions. Summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation, and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS.\nSecurity is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS's advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long term gen AI work with AWS. We're building dozens of gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched, and others of which are in development. This morning we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery. Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control, or which are the best cold weather rain jackets, and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products.\nYou can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions, and it retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features, and it will return answers quickly. We're at the start of what Rufus will do, with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it'll make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it'll ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\nIn addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term, touching on two of them. In October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who do not have it. Today we launched two end to end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a two way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K, and made an Amazon purchase over our end to end communication network. It is rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this.\nWe're on track to launch our first production satellites in the first half of 2024 and start beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress during the quarter. We also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, and unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive Alerts all took big leaps forward. On top of their very good start last year, we launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game, and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year over year, and with advertisers as we made dramatic year over year gains in ad sales.\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling, exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Citadel, and more. With the addition of ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year, and I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers. Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. We saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year over year, and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year over year to $36.9 billion. Trailing 12 month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year.\nThese financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics, such as stores cost to serve, which decreased year over year for the first time since 2018, and in our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year over year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. During the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection, and convenience.\nOur shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October, and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in last minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies. It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials categories, like Beauty and in Health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers.\nThird party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays, with worldwide third party seller services revenue growing at 19% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and worldwide third party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, as our teams work hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers, and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for.\nWe're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability, North America's segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year over year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter over quarter since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 2022. We have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve. The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network.\nOverall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement, helping drive faster speeds, and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include line haul, ocean, and rail, and from a more stable labor market resulting in improved staffing levels. In our international segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year over year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates, and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. The international segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth.\nIn our largest established countries like the UK, Germany, and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continue to expand their customer offerings while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS, revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations, and as these optimizations slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and re-accelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI.\nIt's still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all three layers, and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability, and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year over year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year over year, and effectively flat on a quarter over quarter basis. This margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring, shifting to free cash flow.\nOn a trailing twelve month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year over year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency, driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year over year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment, and transportation. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year over year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI, and large language models.\nOne thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a Useful Life study for our servers, and we are increasing the useful life from five years to six years. Beginning in January 2024, we will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs, and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers. With that, let's move on to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press Star then one on your touchtone telephone. At this time, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much for taking the questions. I'm just going to do a two-parter on AWS. If we take a step back, can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads, and some elements that have allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4, and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024? Then, against your broader comments on CapEx, any color on how we should be thinking about AI-driven CapEx within the AWS initiatives against the broader CapEx commentary? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYou.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah, that's right.\nThis is Dave, just to give you that figure, the balance was $155.7 billion as of 31 December 2023.\nThat's up more than $45 billion.\nYear over year and $20 billion quarter over quarter.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYou know, if you look back at the revenue growth, it accelerated to 13.2% in Q4 as we just mentioned. That was an acceleration, and we expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024. We're excited about the resumption, I guess, of migrations that companies may have put on hold during 2023 in some cases, and interest in our generative AI and products like Bedrock and Q. As Andy was describing on the CapEx side, let me talk in total for the company. We had $48 billion in 2023, which was down $10 billion year over year. Talked about during the year quite a bit, a lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure. Infrastructure, mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses, was about 60% of our spend, so it reached a very high percentage. We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024.\nCapEx will go up in 2024. I'm not giving a number today, but we do. We're still working through plans for the year, but we do expect CapEx to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions. Primarily, the work we're doing, the generative AI projects in the fulfillment center and logistics area, I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand. Although we are seeing some additional investments for same day delivery sites and automation robotics, the trend for that, most of the large percentage of the spend will be in infrastructure, is going to continue into 2024.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nAdd a few things to what Brian said. I think just as it relates to the first part of the question, the way to think about backlog conversion is these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals, typically with customers. Then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads. Some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter, first of all, I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened. It's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see any more, but it's just attenuated very significantly.\nWhat we've seen is that migrations, and this speaks to some of the backlog migrations that were proceeding, but maybe not at the pace that we saw before, have started to pick up again. We've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly, but were signing more slowly in more uncertain environments, a lot of those got done in the last quarter, and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples, but that was some of several, and we're continuing to see that trend.\nOn the GenAI side, if you look at the GenAI revenue we have in absolute numbers, it's a pretty big number, but in the scheme of a $100 billion annual revenue run rate business, it's still relatively small, much smaller than what it will be in the future, where we really believe we're going to drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years. It's encouraging how fast it's growing, and our offering is really resonating with customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director and Internet Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two, Andy. The first one is sort of on the cost to serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018. As you sort of look into 2024 and 2025, can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling that has to happen to continue to drive down that cost of service back to 2018 levels, or however you're thinking about your North Star from that perspective? The second one is one sort of philosophically about capital returns. It looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here. How do you think about the idea of buyback, share repurchases, or some type of capital return program to sort of help shareholders out?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, thank you, Brian. I appreciate it. I'll take the first, and I'll let Brian take the second. You know, on the cost to serve coming down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don't think that we feel like we're where we're going to ultimately be. You know, I think we feel like we have meaningful upside there. You know, I think one thing that it's easy to do is to make as large a change as we made in regionalization in the US and think, check, you know, we got that done. The reality is we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023, in 2024. When the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities, there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that.\nI also think in many ways it was very useful for us to go through what was a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network the size of UPS in 18 months. It was disruptive to get that optimized. One of the things that was very useful was it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with the fulfillment network. We looked at it with really a beginner's eye. We have found so many areas that we believe we can evolve that I think will both help our cost to serve and, even more importantly, deliver faster delivery speeds for customers.\nI mentioned one area, which in particular you'll see us focus on over the next year or two, is just we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes, and then where we locate inventory in association with that, which will accomplish both of those tasks. You know, for us, I don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the North Star in cost to serve. I think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah, I'd just add a couple other items there. You know, we've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls as we scale. I think you're seeing that as part of, you know, our ability to lower cost per serve not only in operations, it's actually throughout the company. We're, you know, we're seeing reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us especially hard in 2021 and 2022. Things like transportation or transportation services, fuel, and others. Not totally out of the woods there, but coming down, and we still see some more upside. On your share repurchase question, first of all, just really excited to actually have that question. No one's asked me that in three years, and appreciate it.\nYou know, we have come through a tumultuous period where, you know, as Andy just said, we doubled the size of our logistics footprint and invested heavily, and you saw that in negative free cash flow, at least on our all to calculation for the period 2021-2022. We're glad to see the improvement and the bounce back in free cash flow. A lot of and we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often, and I have nothing to announce today. Again, we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us. We're glad to have the liquidity, better liquidity at the end of 2023, and we're going to try to continue to build that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Brian, you've seen very good improvement in international profitability over the last several quarters. Can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about as you look to move into positive operating income, and then how international could potentially approach North America levels over time? A follow-up there, are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the Red Sea, and does that factor into your outlook at all for Q1? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah, let me start with the second one first. We're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world, especially as you say, in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the US and to Europe. We're just working very hard to, you know, make that not back up on customers and we'll, you know, continue to work that. It's not a material impact included in our guidance in Q1. Again, as I said, we're vigilant on that and we'll, you know, work to take steps where we need to to make sure that customer experience is not impacted on the international segment operating income. We're very pleased with the results, especially over the last few quarters. We improved operating income by $1.8 billion year over year.\nI would attribute it to the steady progress that Andy was saying about the US. Again, cost of service down, advertising is stronger, you know, a lot of attention to cost, a lot of attention to investments and where we're going to invest, and other fixed cost controls. A lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of Europe and Japan. I would divide this segment a bit into a couple buckets. First, there's that international segment, excuse me, European established country segment.\nAnd that's.\nIt behaves a lot like you would see in North America if you look at the emerging countries. Again, we've launched 10 countries in the last seven years. They're all on their own trajectory of journey to profitability and significance with customers, and we're pleased with that. I think they're all growing nicely and again leveraging their cost structure, investing wisely in Prime benefits, but all on a curve to break even and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that we have advanced, loaded, I would say, Prime benefits in our international markets. We think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention. The investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter to quarter.\nWe had a bit of a higher spend in, excuse me, in digital content in Q4 as we had a number of marketing and content, especially around live sports, English Premier League, and Champions League in Germany and Italy, for example. We like those benefits and those investments. They're a proven vehicle for customer acquisition, as I said, and it gets people shopping on our sites, and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with Amazon.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, thanks. Two questions please. I think you mentioned, Brian, that North American margins have been improved for seven quarters in a row or something like that, a significant number. I would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization, given your capacity, CapEx commentary about retail, the regional center efficiencies, and then overall moderation in shipping and logistics costs, labor costs, all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in North American margins. If you would comment on that. Secondly, on the Prime Video, Amazon Prime Video, I know it just launched, but could you provide any color context on expectations around that? You've got a massive number of Prime users, you're coming in with a reasonable, you know, CPM with low ad load, but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you.\nIf you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside, that'd be really appreciated. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure, Mark, thank you. I think Andy laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure, the regionalization, the growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic, great efficiency and work with productivity across really all of our operations network, attention to fixed cost and lowering costs where we can, maintaining costs where we can, the increase in advertising success, in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates. All of those trends we expect to continue, and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue. As we said, you know, we have a one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability. You know, we are working to, we're not putting a limit on our improvement.\nWe're going to continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve and might add, at the same time, you know, increase the customer experience. Because we did that, we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them. We're happy with that, and we'll continue to do both to improve the customer experience and also to lower our cost and leverage our cost structure. Your second question on ads, I can't.\nScale it right now. I mean.\nWhat I would say for ads in video is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We're looking for ways to increase our advertising and our streaming properties, including Fire TV, but also Prime Video, as well as things like FreeVee and Twitch. It's an important part of the total business model, and we expect it'll allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that, and we feel good about it. The way we anticipate the ads progressing, we will not have heavy ad loads relative to what they may see on other network TV and other things. Like all of our advertising, we're trying to get useful for customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Devitt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wedbush Securities\n\nThanks. I have one on grocery and one on healthcare. First on grocery, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between .com, Fresh, and Whole Foods, and as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities, how that's lowering the cost of reverse logistics, and whether there's a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business. Secondly, on healthcare, in such a poor, notoriously poor customer experience industry, you've made significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care. I'd just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer term vision in healthcare. Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah. On grocery, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. We always think about our grocery business right now in kind of, I'll call it, three big macro segments.\nThe first is non-perishables, where these are things like consumables, canned goods, pet food, health and beauty products, and pharmaceutical. It's a big business, and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip. We're really pleased with that business. It's really the way most mass merchandisers got into the grocery business a few decades ago. That continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We have a physical presence along with online, in Whole Foods Market, which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery, and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip. We also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side, where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there.\nYou'll see that keep growing and expanding, and feel very good about that as well. If you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence. That's what we've been trying to do with Fresh. Over several years, we have tested, we've been testing a V2 of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago and a few locations in Southern California. It's very early, it's just a few months in, but the results are very promising on almost every dimension. We need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating. If we continue to see that, then the issue becomes how fast and what's the best way to expand.\nWe have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between, you know, the non perishables and then our selection, Whole Foods as well as Fresh. I think you can expect to see that over time, both in the user experience on the app and in the website, as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities. Being able to get better leverage there, better economics, and then allowing people to order in one concerted place, but be able to pick up in multiple places, pick up from multiple types of grocery products in one place. You're seeing us already do more of that, and I think you can expect in the future in the healthcare space.\nYou know, if you think about what we do on the retail side, adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension. It's something that customers had asked us for, for many years. It's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business. We think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it, but customers so badly wanted it. The experience we thought could be better, and we could be a meaningful part of changing that, that we pursued it. I really like the momentum that we're seeing in our Amazon Pharmacy business. It's growing really quickly. Even more important than how fast it's growing, if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months, it's just substantially improved from where it already was. Pretty good. People really love the experience.\nI think that when you know the healthcare experience, particularly in the US, is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one. I think that when we tell our grandkids that the way you used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment three weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, wait in the reception for 15 minutes, get put into an exam room for 15 minutes, doctor comes in, talks to you for five to 10 minutes, and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy, people are just not. Our grandkids will not believe that was the experience, and it's not going to be. You already see that changing, and it's part of what attracted us in such a significant way to One Medical.\nIt's just their application, their app is so easy to use. You have all your healthcare data in one spot. You can do chats with medical practitioners, you can do video calls if you need to see someone. There are physical locations in lots of metropolitan cities where you can get in the same day if you need to see a specialist. They're plugged into specialists in all the cities in which we operate, where you can get in a day or two later. Like, it's just, it's a very different experience. If you actually need medication, you can get that sent to you in a day or two, either through Amazon Pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with. That experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing. I think it's, you know, again, still early days. We're excited.\nWe launched for Prime members the ability to get a One Medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year, which is 50% off the typical price. That saw a very good take up. It's still early days, but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience. If we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like to get pharmaceutical items, there's a lot of things that we might be able to help customers with over time, that, you know, whether it's wellness or whether it's diet, there's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Internet Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on AWS for a moment. You outlined the Generative AI stack, which I think is very clear. I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that, and then maybe expand if you could. Annie, a little bit on the strategy for GenAI on the consumer-facing side of the business. I know you launched Rufus today. Is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on the retail apps, or what's your vision there? Thank you. Yeah. Colin, I would say a few things.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon",
    "content2": "First, on Generative AI, you know, when we talk to customers, particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI, many are still thinking through at which layers of those three layers of the stack I laid out that they want to operate in. We predict that most companies will operate in at least two of them. I also think even though it may not be the case early on, many of the technically capable companies will operate at all three. They will build their own models, they will leverage existing models from us, and then they're going to build apps.\nOne of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in Generative AI is that it's a very iterative process and real work to go from plugging a question into a chatbot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience and your reputation, and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need. What we see is that customers want choice. They don't want just one model to rule the world. They want different models for different applications, and they want to experiment with all different sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics. Bedrock is really resonating with customers.\nThey know they want to change all these variables, try and experiment, and have something that manages all those different transitions and changes so they can figure out what works best for them, especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative AI applications. It is incredibly important to them. It's part of why we see Bedrock resonating so much in the same way. What's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q is just if you can get 30%-40% better productivity for your developers, which in many cases for companies is their most scarce resource, it's a game changer. They won't rule out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion, but if it can assist them to get 80% plus the way there quickly, that's a big deal.\nOne of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion. Yes, you know, it's an expert on AWS. It will help you, you know, it helps you write the code, but it also helps you debug the code, helps you test the code, and it helps you do transformations, and helps you figure out how to multi-step implement features. There's a lot of, you know, helps you troubleshoot. If there's something in your application that's awry, Q can find it and help you fix it. You know, it also lets you look at all your data repositories, whether it's intranets or wikis, or, you know, the 40 plus data connectors like Salesforce, Atlassian, Zendesk, and Slack. It lets you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action.\nIt's a pretty differentiated capability there. When enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive, they're looking at what's the array of capabilities in these different coding companion options they have. We're spending a lot of time, our enterprises are quite excited about it. It created a meaningful stir at Re Invent. What you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have, and they make decisions for their employee base. We're seeing very good momentum there. The question about how we're thinking about gen AI in our consumer businesses, we're building dozens of generative AI applications across the company. Every business that we have has multiple generative AI applications that they're building, and they're all in different stages, many of which have launched and others of which are in development.\nIf you just look in some of our consumer businesses on the retail side, we built a generative AI application that allowed customers to look at a summary of customer reviews so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product. We launched a generative AI application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items. We've built a generative application in our fulfillment centers that forecasts how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center. The start of the rollout of Rufus today is really just another step, but we think one that's pretty meaningful in being a generative AI powered shopping assistant.\nIt's trained on our very expansive product catalog, as well as our community Q&As, customer reviews, and the broader web. It lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites. If you want buying advice, like what should I look for in a pair of headphones, or if you are doing purpose buying, like what should I buy for cold weather golf, or comparisons, what's the difference between lip gloss or lip oil, or you want recommendations on the best Valentine's Day gifts, or you're on a detailed page with rich product info where you don't want to go through the whole page, you want to ask, is this pickleball racket good for beginners, all those questions you can plug in and get really good answers.\nIt's seamlessly integrated in the Amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action. You know, I think that that's just the next iteration. I think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers. I could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses. You know, our advertising business is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and an ad copy is written and the other way around. You kind of think about Alexa, where we're building a very large, expansive, large language model that's going to make Alexa even more productive and helpful for customers. Every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative AI applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building.\nI don't see that changing for many years. We have a lot of ideas.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nThanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nSam."

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2023 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon.com\n\nHello and welcome to our Q3 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 26 October 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.\nOur results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nThanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $143.1 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, $11.2 billion in operating income, up 34.3% year-over-year, or $8.7 billion, and $20.2 billion in trailing twelve month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, which is up $41.7 billion versus the comparable period last year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in lowering our cost to serve, improving our customer experiences, and investing for future growth. I'll start with our stores business.\nOur move earlier this year from a single national fulfillment network in the US to eight distinct regions represented one of the most significant changes to our fulfillment network in our history. This change has gone more smoothly and made more impact than we optimistically expected, and you can see the benefits in many forms.\nRegional fulfillment clusters with higher local in stock levels and optimized connections between fulfillment centers and delivery stations mean shorter distances and fewer touches to get items to customers. Shorter travel distances and fewer touches mean lower cost to serve. Perhaps most importantly, shorter distances and fewer touches mean that customers are getting their shipments faster. We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29 year history.\nAs I talked about last quarter, we know how important speed of delivery is to customer satisfaction and buying behavior. A good example is the significant growth we're seeing in consumables and everyday essentials. When customers are getting items as quickly and conveniently as they are now from Amazon, they're going to consider us more frequently for more of their shopping needs.\nAs we've shared the last few quarters, we've reevaluated every part of our fulfillment network over the last year. The first substantial re-architecture centered on the regionalization change. We obviously like the results, but don't think we fully realized all the benefits yet. We continue to make steady improvements in fine-tuning the placement algorithms to enable even more in-region fulfillment, and to further increase consolidation into fewer shipments.\nWe've also identified several substantial changes to our inbound processes that we believe could have a significant impact on our cost to serve and speed of delivery. We have a long way before being out of ideas to improve cost and speed. The team is really humming on this, and I'm proud of the way they're inventing and executing together.\nMoving to AWS and our investments in Generative AI, AWS revenue grew 12% year-over-year in Q3 with $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $92 billion. AWS's year-over-year growth rate continued to stabilize in Q3, while we still saw elevated cost optimization relative to a year ago. It's continued to attenuate as more companies transition to deploying net new workloads.\nCompanies have moved more slowly in an uncertain economy in 2023 to complete deals, but we're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up, and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed. For perspective, we signed several new deals in September with an effective date in October.\nThat won't show up in any GAAP reported number for Q3, but the collection of which is higher than our total reported deal volume for all of Q3. Deal signings are always lumpy, and the revenue happens over several years, but we like the recent deal momentum we're seeing. Top of mind for most companies continues to be Generative AI. As I mentioned last quarter, we think about Generative AI as having three macro layers, each of which is very large, and each of which we're investing a few updates there.\nAt the lowest layer is the compute to train large language models or LLMs and produce inferences or predictions. The key to this compute is the chip inside it. As we've shared, we've been working on custom silicon for training and inference with our Trainium and Inferentia chips, respectively.\nRecently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers.\nIn the middle layer, which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock, which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, Cohere, and AI21, as well as from Amazon's own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data, but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control, and features that they run the rest of their applications with AWS, all through a managed service.\nIn the last couple months, we've announced the imminent addition of Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it's being made available through a fully managed service. Also, through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock, with exclusive early access to unique features for model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models.\nBedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents, which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of Generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use, which models they use for what purposes, and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire. In our opinion, the only certainty is that there will continue to be a high rate of change.\nBedrock helps customers with this fluidity, allowing them to rapidly experiment with and move between model types and sizes, and enabling them to pick the right tool for the right job. The customer reaction to Bedrock has been very positive, and the general availability has buoyed that further.\nBedrock is the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready Generative AI applications, and a real game changer for developers and companies trying to get value out of this new technology. At the top layer, which are the applications that run the LLMs, our Generative AI coding companion, Amazon CodeWhisperer, has gotten a lot of early traction, and got a lot more powerful recently with the launch of its new customization capability.\nThe number one enterprise request for code companions has been wanting these companions to be familiar with customers' proprietary code bases. It's not just having code companions trained in open source code, companies want the equivalent of a longtime senior engineer who knows their code base well. That's what CodeWhisperer just launched, another first of its kind out there in its current form, and customers are excited about it.\nA few last comments on AWS's Generative AI work. As you can tell, we're focused on doing what we've always done for customers, taking technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses, but they can be complex and expensive, and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. It's also worth remembering that customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. Much of that data resides in AWS, as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure. We're innovating and delivering at a rapid rate, and our approach is resonating with customers.\nThe number of companies building Generative AI apps in AWS is substantial and growing very quickly, including Adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater, Clariant, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines, to name a few.\nWe are also seeing success with Generative AI startups like Perplexity.ai, who chose to go all in with AWS, including running future models on Trainium and Inferentia, and the AWS team has a lot of new capabilities to share with its customers at its upcoming AWS re:Invent conference. Beyond AWS, all of our significant businesses are working on Generative AI applications to transform their customer experiences.\nThere are too many for me to name on this call, but a few examples include, in our stores business, we're using Generative AI to help people better discover products they want, and more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use Generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations, and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ.\nWe're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information, letting the models do the rest. In advertising, we just launched a Generative AI image generation tool where all brands need to do is upload a product photo and description to quickly create unique lifestyle images that will help customers discover products they love. In Alexa, we built a much more expansive LLM and previewed the early version of this. Apart from being a more intelligent version of herself, Alexa's new conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once, as well as more natural and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases.\nWe continue to be convicted that the vision of being the world's best personal assistant is a compelling and viable one, and that Alexa has a good chance to be one of the long-term winners in this arena. Every one of our businesses is building Generative AI applications to change what's possible for customers, and we have a lot more to come. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making in our newer initiatives, just to name a few. We're pleased with what we're seeing in Prime Video. Prime Video continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition, where it's often one of the top two drivers of customers signing up for Prime.\nWe also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling, exclusive content for Prime members, but also offer the best selection of premium streaming video content anywhere with our Marketplace offering, including channels where customers can subscribe to channels like Max, Paramount+, BET+, and MGM+, as well as our broad transaction video on demand selection.\nAs we continue to invest in compelling content, beginning in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. If customers prefer an ad-free option, we plan to offer that for an additional $2.99 per month for US members.\nThere is still a lot of work to be done and innovation ahead, but we're excited about our future in Prime Video. We're seeing progress on a number of our investments that expand our ability to serve more consumers and sellers in their e-commerce missions. Our emerging international stores continue to improve their customer experiences and profitability, and are on a strong trajectory. Both consumers and sellers are excited about Buy with Prime, which enables third-party sellers with direct-to-consumer websites to offer Amazon Prime members the same fast payments and delivery options they receive on Amazon.com.\nWe recently announced the capability for sellers to integrate Buy with Prime with their Shopify account, making it easier for Shopify merchants to manage their businesses, with inventory, pricing, and promotions automatically synced in one place.\nWe're seeing very positive early response from sellers to Supply Chain by Amazon, a fully automated set of supply chain services where Amazon can pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels, and deliver directly to customers, all without sellers having to worry about managing their supply chain.\nOur healthcare team is continuing to make healthcare easier for people to access. The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year, and customers are responding to that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback.\nWe built RxPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products, and partner with Blue Shield of California to offer a first of its kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists.\nWe remain convinced that we can be part of the solution in making healthcare a better customer experience, and our Low Earth Orbit Satellite Initiative, Project Kuiper, which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of two prototype satellites.\nWe will use this multi-month mission to test our satellites and network from space, and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite production later this year. I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world who are gearing up for two of our most significant events across the company. First, our annual AWS re:Invent conference that begins on 27 November 2023.\nThe team is excited to share a lot of new capabilities with customers, and provide an array of opportunities for builders to learn and connect with one another. On the store side, we've already kicked off what will be our 29th holiday shopping season. Prime Big Deal Days, held earlier this month, was our most successful October holiday kickoff event ever, with Prime members saving more than $1 billion across hundreds of millions of items sold.\nJust as we do all year long, we aim to make our customers' lives easier and better every day, and there's no time where it's more important to us that we deliver on this mission than during the busy holiday shopping season. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nThanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the Q3. Worldwide revenue was $143.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and approximately $100 million above the top end of our guidance range. This is our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $11.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion year-over-year, and $2.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\nNorth America revenue was $87.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, and international revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange. During the quarter, we held our biggest Prime Day event ever, with Prime members purchasing more than 375 million items worldwide, and saving more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across the Amazon Store.\nOutside of Prime Day, we continue to see strong demand across everyday essentials, including categories like beauty, health, and personal care. From a customer behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can, and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items. Building on the momentum from last quarter, we set another record for delivery speed. For the year to date period to the Q3, we have delivered at the fastest speeds ever in the United States.\nThese improvements in delivery speeds have been a key driver of growth and are resulting in increased purchase frequency by our Prime members. Third party sellers grew at 18% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by selection expansion and growing adoption of our optional services for sellers, including Fulfillment by Amazon, paid account management, and more.\nDuring the quarter we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising, which grew 25% year-over-year excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products, as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers, and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We've seen strong improvement in our profitability.\nNorth America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen six consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past six quarters.\nThe Q3 marked a second full quarter of regionalization within the US, and we're pleased with the early results. Regionalization has allowed us to simplify the network by reducing the number of line haul lanes, increasing volume within existing line haul lanes, and adding more direct fulfillment center to delivery station connections. We have also been focused on optimizing inventory placement in the new regionalized network, which, when coupled with the simplification mentioned earlier, is helping contribute to an overall reduction in cost to serve.\nAdditionally, in the quarter, we saw benefits from lower inflation, primarily within line haul, ocean, and rail shipping rates, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. While we are encouraged by the improvements in operating profit, we still see a lot of opportunity in front of us.\nIn International, we were closer to break even during the quarter with an operating loss of $95 million. This was an improvement of $2.4 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through higher productivity, decreased inflationary pressures, and improvements in leverage across our established and emerging international countries as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations.\nMoving to AWS, revenues were $23.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $900 million of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, while optimizations still remain a headwind, we've seen the rate of new cost optimization slow down in AWS, and we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline.\nCustomers are excited about our approach to Generative AI, with several new announcements made during the quarter, including a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, opening Amazon Bedrock up to general availability, adding Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock in the near future, and new customization capabilities of CodeWhisperer.\nAWS remains a clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position in the number of customers, the size of our partner ecosystem, our breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance in the industry. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, we believe we are in good position to drive future growth as the rates of cost optimization slow down.\nAWS operating income was $7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%. This is an improvement of approximately 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by increased leverage on our headcount costs. Shifting to free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $20.2 billion, an improvement of $41.7 billion year-over-year.\nThe largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. Key drivers of this improvement include reductions in our cost to serve, continued advertising growth, and improved leverage on our fixed costs. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably with our inventory efficiency as we improve our inventory placement. Now, let's turn to our capital investments.\nWe define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $50 billion for the trailing twelve-month period ended 30 September 2023, down from $60 billion in the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be approximately $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx, supports growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to Generative AI and large language model efforts.\nAs we head into the Q4, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. Looking at our operations network, our inventory is the best position it's ever been heading into the holiday season, enabling us to serve customers with fast delivery speeds from their local regions.\nWe continue to believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you at this time. We will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone at this time. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, Justin, your line is live.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks for that. I'll ask about AWS. I guess, the first question is, as you look forward in the Q4, you mentioned you've signed some new deals. Are you seeing less cost optimization as you look forward, or do you think it'll be similar to Q3? Second, you couldn't help but notice the big margin improvement in AWS all the way back to where you were seven quarters ago. Could you talk about the drivers and sustainability of those margins? Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nYeah, Justin, sure. This is Andy. You know, I think if you look at AWS, we grew 12% year-over-year. I think that you saw a continued stabilization of our year-over-year growth rate. You know, it included $919 million incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which it's hard to compare and do the math across different players because not everyone discloses them clearly.\nAs far as we can tell, that also looks like the most absolute growth of any of the players out there. We're still seeing elevated customer optimization levels than we've seen in the last year or a year before this, I should say. If you look at the optimization, it's more than a year ago, but it's meaningfully attenuating from where we've seen the last few quarters.\nYou know, if you look at the optimization too, what's interesting is, it's not all customers deciding to shut down workloads. A very significant portion of the optimization are customers taking advantage of enhanced price performance capabilities in AWS and making use of it. For example, if you look at the growth of customers using EC2 instances that are Graviton based, which is our custom chip that we built for generalized CPUs, the number of people and the percentage of instances launched that are Graviton based as opposed to Intel or AMD based is very substantially higher than it was before. One of the things that customers love about Graviton is that it provides 40% better price per performance than the other leading x86 processors. You see a lot of growth in Graviton.\nYou also see a lot of customers who are moving from the hourly on demand rates for significant portions of their workloads to one to three year commitments, which we call savings plans. Those are just good examples of some of the cost optimization that customers are making in less certain economies where it's really good for customers, short and long term. I think it's also good for us.\nWe're starting to see, as I said, we're seeing that optimization attenuate. I expect that to continue over time. I remain very optimistic about AWS in the medium to long term. It's because we have the most functionality by a large amount, we have a much larger partner ecosystem than you'll find elsewhere, and we have stronger security and operational performance than you can find elsewhere. I think we're the most customer focused.\nEven if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. I think that matters to customers. We have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. If you believe like we do, that equation's going to flip, there's a lot more there for us. You look at the very substantial, gigantic new Generative AI opportunity, which I believe will be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years. I think we have a unique and broad approach that's really resonating with customers.\nYou can see it with, you know, the array of customers I mentioned that are using us, starting to build workloads for Generative AI and who have already on top of us. I can see it also just, you know, the growth rate for us in Generative AI is very fast. You know, again, I have, I've seen a lot of different numbers publicly. It's a little hard to measure them apples to apples. In our best estimation, the amount of growth we're seeing and the absolute amount of Generative AI business we're seeing compares very favorably with anything else I've seen externally. I think that you can see that in the deals that we're doing too. I spoke about the significant number of deals that we've closed over the last couple months.\nA lot of those conversations, a big piece of it is what I mentioned earlier. The functionality, the ecosystem, the operational performance, the security, how you take care of customers, but also whether or not they like your vision, and the set of products that you're building in this brand new technology space. Generative AI, which I think has been very effective so far. You know, to me, I think there's a lot of growth in front of AWS. I'm very optimistic about it.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nJustin, on your comment or question about AWS margin, yes, the margin improved 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter. An increase of op income of $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter for AWS, is driven primarily by our headcount reductions in Q2 and also continued slowness in hiring, rehiring open positions. There's been also a lot of cost control in non-people categories, things like infrastructure costs, and also discretionary costs. Natural gas prices and other energy costs have come down a bit in Q3 as well. As we've said historically, the operating margin for AWS is going to fluctuate quarter to quarter, and this is a good example of that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Can you just talk more about how the regional fulfillment network is exceeding your expectations, and then also how does that support your confidence in moving North America beyond mid single digit margin levels? Perhaps on Generative AI, obviously a lot of innovation here. You talked about a number of different customers running early workloads. How should we think about the timing just to drive some tangible monetization there? Thank you.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nWell, I'll start on regionalization. It was such a significant change for us in the network. It's hard to really appreciate what a big change across so many dimensions it was, that for us to make such a change has all sorts of risk. I think the team did a great job planning around it, being very thorough. Yeah, I think that we were able to, we were able with our placement algorithms to get more regional local in stock levels than we anticipated.\nI think until you actually put all the connections together, we changed a lot of the connections from a lot of these middle connections going from fulfillment centers to sortation centers and then to delivery stations, to connecting the fulfillment centers and delivery stations more directly, which of course is easier to do when you have more local in stock in a region.\nI think that we were able, the connections that we made and the optimization that we made there allowed us to get shorter transportation distances than we even anticipated and items to people a lot quicker. One of the issues you got to worry about when you make a change that big, is whether or not you end up splitting shipments and having fewer items per box and per shipment. That was also something that we really had to work through in the design and in the early stages. We've gotten a lot better on that. We're just, across the board, seeing shorter transportation distances and much faster delivery to customers. When you deliver faster delivery to customers, they actually start to consider you for a lot more items than they otherwise would.\nI think it's part of what, if you look at our very significant growth rates right now in everyday essentials and consumables, a lot of it is when you, you know, if you're going to order something that you need in the same day or next day, you're not going to consider it if it's coming in three or four days. When you're considering consistently getting it sub same day or the next day, it just changes what you're willing to do. I think the second question was on Gen AI and the timing of monetization.\nWhat I would tell you is that we have been surprised at the pace of growth in Generative AI. Our Generative AI business is growing very, very quickly, as I mentioned earlier, and almost by any measure, it's a pretty significant business for us already.\nI would also say that companies are still in the relatively early stages. I mean, now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90%+ of the global IT spend being on premises, where I think that equation's going to flip in 10 years, I think cloud is early. With that lens on, I still think we're very early in Generative AI.\nWhat's interesting too around Generative AI, because we have so many companies who are doing all sorts of prototypes and it's really accelerated very rapidly on the training side with Trainium and Inferentia and then on the application building and running side with Bedrock, is that companies are still trying to sort out for themselves what they're going to run at large scale production in all these areas.\nWhat happens is you try a model, you test a model, you like the results of the model, and then you plug it into your application. What a lot of companies figure out quickly is that using the really large models and the large sizes ends up often being more expensive than what they anticipate and what they want to spend on that application. Sometimes there is too much latency in getting the answers as it shovels through the really large models. Customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and then different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases.\nIt's one of the things that I think is so useful about Bedrock, is that customers are trying so many variants right now that to have a small service that not only lets you leverage lots of third party as well as Amazon large language models, but also lots of different sizes, and that makes the transition of moving those workloads easy between them, is very advantageous.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. One on AWS, one on the retail business. On AWS AI, Andy, I recognize you have a pretty multi-pronged AI approach, but just could you talk us through sort of one or two of the early Generative AI products where you're seeing the most early demand and interest? As you talk to customers, are there still hurdles or pain points that you're not quite serving in your product suite you look to solve and innovate on over the next couple years in AI?\nThe second one, you've made a lot of steps on the regionalization of warehouses and making it more efficient. Where are you on robotics in the warehouses, and how should we think about potential impact of that to drive profitability even higher.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nOn the AI side, I think that if you're looking for some of the products that we're offering that have a lot of early resonance and traction, I'd start with Bedrock. Customers are very excited about Bedrock, and it's making it so much easier to get Generative AI applications built. You know, machine learning and AI has been something that people have been excited about for 25 years.\nIn my opinion, about a half dozen years ago, it took a pretty significant leap forward where it was much easier given the economics and scalability of compute and storage. Some of the tools that we built, like SageMaker, made it much easier for everyday developers to start to interact with AI. It took another meaningful step forward with Generative AI.\nStill, it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use, and how you actually want to employ them, trying to make sure you have the right results, trying to make sure you get safe results, trying to make sure you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want. It's hard. Customers would like—there's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners, but most companies don't. Bedrock just takes so much of the difficulty out of those decisions and those variables that people are very excited about Bedrock. They're using it in a very broad way.\nThey're extremely excited about not just the set of models in there, but if you look at a leader like Anthropic and the ability for our customers in Bedrock to have exclusive early access to models, customization tools, and fine tuning, which gives them more control, there's a lot of buzz, a lot of usage, and a lot of traction around Bedrock. I would also say our chips, you know, Trainium and Inferentia, you know, as most people know, there's a real shortage right now in the industry in chips. It's really hard to get the amount of GPUs that everybody wants, so it's just another reason why Trainium and Inferentia are so attractive to people.\nThey have better price performance characteristics than the other options out there, but also the fact that you can get access to them, and we've done, I think, a pretty good job providing supply there and ordering meaningfully in advance as well. You're seeing very large LLM providers make big bets on those chips. I think Anthropic deciding to train their future LLM models on Trainium and using Inferentia as well is really a statement. You look at the really hot startup Perplexity.ai, who also just made a decision to do all their training and inference on top of Trainium, Inferentia. Those are two examples. I'd say CodeWhisperer too is just, again, it's just a game changer.\nIf you can allow your engineers not to have to do the more repetitive work of cutting and pasting and building certain functions that really, if somebody knew your code base better, could do, it's a productivity game changer for developers. Then actually launching that customer optimization vehicle so that they actually understand your own proprietary code base, that is something that customers are quite excited about. Those are all, to me, early traction AI. There's so much more to provide, Brian. I mean, I think people, you know, even though Bedrock is incredible, it's so much easier to use than people trying to build models themselves and build the applications.\nI think people are still looking to find ways to make it easier to look at a big corpus of data and run an agent on top of it where maybe they do not have to do all that work themselves. I think people are looking for automated ways to understand different developer environments and be able to ask any question of the developer environment. There is a lot more. It is going to be a long time before we run out of services, and I think it is a good thing to look toward the next few months and reinvent to see the additional things that team launches. I think on the robotics piece, it is a very significant investment for us. It has been for several years. It has made a huge difference for us.\nIt's made a big difference for us both on the productivity side, on the cost side, as well as, importantly, on the safety side, where we can have our teammates working on things that are even safer than what they get to work on today. We have a very substantial investment of additional robotics initiatives, I would say, many of which are coming to fruition in 2024 and 2025, that we think will make a further additional impact on the cost, productivity, and, also, safety in our fulfillment centers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe one follow-up on AWS and one on the ads business. Andy, would love your perspective. You know, the cloud optimization theme started in the second half of 2022 when there were a lot of macro concerns, and then the AI theme really only sort of came to the forefront in the last eight or nine months.\nWhat's your perspective on how turning the calendar into 2024 and there being a new IT budget cycle could possibly lead us to put the optimization theme in the background and some of the theme to come more to the forefront when there might be more distinct budgeting around AI as a theme? That'd be number one. In your ads business, you're approaching $50 billion run rate, and it's compounding in the mid-20s. What are you most excited about on the initiative front, to continue to build scale both on Amazon properties and possibly off Amazon as a broader digital advertising player? Thanks so much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com\n\nOn the AWS side, you know my perspective, you know, we'll obviously all have to wait and see to some extent, but my perspective is that in 2024 you're going to. I think a lot of the relatively low hanging fruit on optimization has happened in 2023. It's not to say there won't be any more optimization, it's just that there was, you know, there's more low hanging fruit when you have very large footprints and you've built a lot of applications on a platform for you to go decide to optimize if that's what you want to go do. I think 2020, we're already seeing it now with the attenuation of optimization over the last several months. I think you'll continue to see that attenuation continue. We're already seeing more and more companies that are turning their attention to newer initiatives.\nI think what you will see in 2024 and 2025 as well, I don't think it's a one year deal. I think there's going to be a several year trajectory, is that you're going to just see a lot of companies not just looking at the new Generative AI workloads, but also there was a significant number of new customer transformations where companies were going to largely move from being on premises to being in the cloud. That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend, and wary of an uncertain economy.\nI think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making, working with a lot of systems, integrated partners, as well as ourselves, as well as start to see the production in large scale of the Generative AI applications that they're all working on, prototyping, and starting to deploy into production. I think on the ad front, well, there's a lot I'm excited about on the ad side as well. You know, I think that it's interesting what's happened in our ads business. As you know, if you look around the industry, most advertising heavy companies have struggled growth wise as the economy has been difficult.\nYou know, while we see companies being more cautious on the ad side in the top of funnel products, things like display and a little bit of video, we're still seeing a lot of strength in the lower funnel ad products like sponsored products. You know, I think in these types of economies we have fared pretty well in part because we have a number of owned and operated properties that have very large volumes that advertisers and brands want to get in front of. Even in a harder economy, there's going to be a lot of e-commerce purchasing. People want to be in front of our customers in our marketplace or take Thursday Night Football, which is we're in our second season of Thursday Night Football and off to a great start.\nThe ratings are 25% higher than they were a year ago through six weeks. We're doing much better on the advertising side than we did in our first year. That's a property that's really valuable. It's the one game that week, and advertisers want to be in front of customers because there's 13 million customers a week watching. I think part of it is because we have owned and operated properties that have a lot of volume. I think the other piece is that most of our resource on the advertising side is spent on machine learning expert practitioners who are honing algorithms to make sure that the sponsored results people get when they search on something are relevant. Because of that, those ads perform better for advertisers.\nWhen they have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose the ones that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now. In terms of additional things we're excited about, I think that we have barely scraped the surface with respect to figuring out how to intelligently integrate advertising into video, audio, and grocery. I think we're early days in that. I think that we also have started externalizing some of our products, like sponsored products, to third-party websites. You see that with what we've done with Pinterest, Hearst Newspapers, and BuzzFeed. I think, again, we're still pretty early in that area, but it's growing well, and we're very focused on continuing to make it a great customer experience.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, on those AWS deals, Andy, that you talked about in the September quarter, was there something different about those deals? Different industry, different verticals, different geographic markets? Or is it, you know, just kind of a resumption of kind of the deal flow that you'd had in years past? That's the first question.\nSecondly, Brian, international, is it international finally at a point where it can be sustainably profitable going forward? Maybe. Except for the, you know, the seasonally challenged March quarter. Have you rung out enough efficiencies and gotten enough scales, and the oldest markets there are big enough, scalable enough, and profitable enough that it offsets the newer countries? Have you finally reached that point? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com\n\nFirst, just give me a break on international. Thanks for your question. Yeah, quarter was just short of break even, and as you point out, that's a departure from kind of prior trends. I was to answer that question this way, there's multiple things going on internationally. In our established countries, UK, Germany, Japan, France, those countries are profitable and have been profitable.\nWe continue to work on price, selection, and convenience, and all that retail basics, essentially, you know, adding sellers, adding vendors and selection, scaling advertising, and improving the cost structure of our OPS network. Many of the OPS productivity initiatives, probably with the exception of regionalization, is more of a US item right now, but working on all those productivity elements and speed concurrently globally, and you're seeing that internationally, and customers are responding on the emerging side.\nOver the last six years, we launched 10 new countries. History has shown us that those all take time to grow into profitability. The US took 10 years, nine years originally. They are all in their own journey there with profit to growth, scale, profitability, and selection, a number of their variables. Those are all going well as well.\nYou know, we're going to continue to invest internationally in things like Prime and expanding Prime benefits, and we're going to continue to build out the fulfillment and transportation networks to better serve customers. I can't say it's permanently we've reached a break-even threshold for profitability. I think the trend lines are clear, though, and we'll continue to work on accelerating that journey in all countries, especially the emerging ones.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com",
    "content2": "On the AWS deals, it's a really broad mix of industries and geographies, so it's not clumped up in one. Some of them are kind of first really big deals from customers. Some of them are very large expansions of existing agreements where they've, you know, gone from, call it 20% of their workloads to 50% of their workloads moving to AWS in the cloud. You know, it's also, I'm not even really including in that number a number of really big public sector deals that we've done over the last chunk of time that, you know, won't hit for a period of time. You know, all these deals don't hit in a month, they happen over a period of time as you help those customers safely transition and migrate their workloads to AWS.\nIt hasn't been any one piece, and I wish I could tell you we knew exactly why they're starting to happen in faster numbers. I do think, in general, historically, deal volume tends to be lumpy, and it doesn't perfectly distribute over a calendar year. I do think, though, that we've seen this in 2023 for sure, that the time to close deals lengthens, and I think it's all reflective of what most companies in the world have been thinking about the last year, which, just in the face of an uncertain economy, you're going to be more conservative, there are going to be more people involved, and you're going to spend more time on how you can save on your existing costs instead of migrating new workloads or thinking about signing new deals.\nI think what you're just starting to see along with some of the optimization attenuation is that companies are starting to look forward again. We've just seen a collection of those the last couple months that had been being discussed for several months where I think, frankly, both sides thought they would close faster, but just went so far slower than they did. I just think you're starting to see companies look forward more.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon.com\n\nThanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Ra.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nIt.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2023 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello and welcome to our Q2 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 3 August 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are reporting $134.4 billion in revenue and $7.7 billion in operating income, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on several key priorities, namely lowering our cost to serve in our stores business, continuing to innovate on, and improve, our various customer experiences, and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers and our business long term. I'll start with our ongoing effort to lower our cost to serve in our stores. Fulfillment Network Q2 saw another meaningful improvement in this area as we have steadily made progress the last several quarters.\nCentral to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for a delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers, and a more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed while driving its costs higher, and where it doesn't matter much to customers. This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note.\nFirst, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It's also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster, and is better for the environment. There's a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic, and local in stock algorithms.\nIt's also driven by our development and expansion of same day fulfillment facilities, which is our fastest fulfillment mechanism, and one of our least expensive, too. Our same day facilities are located in the largest metro areas around the US, store our top moving 100,000 SKUs, but also cover millions of other SKUs from nearby fulfillment centers that inject selection into these same day facilities, and have a design that streamlines getting items from order to being ready for delivery in as little as 11 minutes. The experience has been so positive for customers in our business that we're planning to double the number of these facilities. We believe that we are far from the law of diminishing returns in improving speed for customers.\nWhile we're seeing strong early results from this regionalization effort, we still see several ways in which we can be more efficient in this structure, and we believe will improve productivity further. We've also reevaluated virtually every part of our fulfillment network this past year and see additional structural changes we can make that provide future upside. We're excited about this cost to serve improvement, but also remain maniacally focused on making customers' lives easier and better every day, and relentlessly inventing to make it so. This means constantly trying to improve experiences that we can deliver to customers short and long term. This customer experience work is at the heart of what we do every day across every one of our businesses. I could spend an hour on this call detailing various examples across the teams. For today, I'll just focus a bit on our stores and AWS businesses.\nFor stores, our priorities continue to be providing customers with great selection, low prices, and convenience. As we've discussed, we've been especially focused on providing even faster delivery speeds. Our speed of delivery has never been faster. In this last quarter, across the top 60 largest US metro areas, more than half of Prime Members' orders arrived the same day or next day. So far this year, we've delivered more than 1.8 billion units to US Prime Members the same or next day, nearly four times what we delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019. Lowering our cost to serve allows us not only to invest in these speed improvements, but also add more selection at lower price points.\nIn particular, we're growing our selection in everyday essentials, enabling customers to avoid going out to get these items and both increasing our basket sizes and the frequency with which customers choose to shop with us. We now have more than 300 million items available with US Prime free shipping, including tens of millions of items with free same day and one day delivery. We're continuing to focus on providing great value, with tens of millions of deals that help customers stretch their dollar or more. For instance, in Q2 2023, we offered customers 144% more deals and coupons than we did in Q2 2022. Prime Day was similar. Amazon offered more deals than any past Prime Day event, with a wide selection across millions of products.\nPrime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion across the Amazon store, helping make it the biggest Prime Day ever. Next, a few words about AWS. AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance. These are important factors for why AWS has grown the way it has over the last several years, and for why AWS is almost double the revenue of any other provider. I've talked to many AWS customers over the years and continue to do so, and while all these factors I mentioned have been big drivers of the business's success, AWS customers tell us that, as importantly, they care about the very different customer focus and orientation in AWS than they see elsewhere.\nAs the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this, and while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS's revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2, where we reported 12% year over year growth. The AWS team continues to innovate and change what's possible for customers at a rapid clip. You can see it across the array of AWS product categories, where AWS leads in compute, networking, storage, database, data solutions, and machine learning, among other areas. The continued invention and delivery in these areas is pretty unusual.\nFor instance, a few years ago we heard consistently from customers that they wanted to find more price performant ways to do generalized compute, and to enable that, we realized that we needed to rethink things all the way down to the silicon and set out to design our own general purpose CPU chips. Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS's Graviton chips and AWS Compute Instances, including 98 of our top 100 Amazon EC2 customers. These chips have about 40% better price performance than other leading x86 processors. The same sort of reimagining is happening in generative AI right now. Generative AI has captured people's imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT.\nIt's important to remember that we're in the very early days of the adoption and success of generative AI, and that consumer applications is only one layer of the opportunity. We think of large language models in generative AI as having three key layers, all of which are very large in our opinion, and all of which AWS is investing heavily in. At the lowest layer is the compute required to train foundational models and do inference or make predictions. Customers are excited by Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs to train large models and develop general AI applications. However, to date there's only been one viable option in the market for everybody, and supply has been scarce.\nThat, along with the chip expertise we've built over the last several years, prompted us to start working several years ago on our own custom AI chips for training called Trainium and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already, and are a very appealing price performance option for customers building and running large language models. We're optimistic that a lot of large language model training and inference will be run on AWS's Trainium and Inferentia chips in the future. We think of the middle layer as being large language models as a service. Stepping back for a second, to develop these large language models it takes billions of dollars and multiple years to develop. Most companies tell us that they don't want to consume that resource building themselves.\nRather, they want access to those large language models, want to customize them with their own data without leaking their proprietary data into the general model, have all the security, privacy, and platform features in AWS work with this new enhanced model, and then have it all wrapped in a managed service. This is what our service Bedrock does and offers customers all of these aforementioned capabilities with not just one large language model, but with access to models from multiple leading large language model companies like Anthropic, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere, and Amazon's own developed large language models called Titan. Customers including Bridgewater Associates, Coda, Lonely Planet, Omnicom, Ryanair, Showpad, and Travelers are using Amazon Bedrock to create generative AI applications.\nWe just recently announced new capabilities from Bedrock, including new models from Cohere, Anthropic's Claude 2, and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, as well as agents for Amazon Bedrock that allow customers to create conversational agents to deliver personalized, up-to-date answers based on their proprietary data and to execute actions. If you think about these first two layers I've talked about, what we're doing is democratizing access to generative AI, lowering the cost of training and running models, enabling access to large language model choice instead of there only being one option, making it simpler for companies of all sizes and technical acumen to customize their own large language model, and build generative AI applications in a secure and enterprise-grade fashion.\nThese are all part of making generative AI accessible to everybody and very much what AWS has been doing for technology infrastructure over the last 17 years. That top layer is where a lot of the publicity and attention have focused, and these are the actual applications that run on top of these large language models. As I mentioned, ChatGPT is an example. We believe one of the early compelling generative AI applications is a coding companion, and it's why we built Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code. It's off to a very strong start and changes the game with respect to developer productivity inside Amazon. Every one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications that reinvent and enhance their customers' experience.\nWhile we will build a number of these applications ourselves, most will be built by other companies, and we're optimistic that the largest number of these will be built on AWS. Remember, the core of AI is data. People want to bring generative AI models to the data, not the other way around. AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics, and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data stored than anybody else. Coupled with providing customers with unmatched choices at these three layers of the generative AI stack, as well as Bedrock's enterprise-grade security that's required for enterprises to feel comfortable putting generative AI applications into production, we think AWS is poised to be customers' long-term partner of choice in generative AI.\nWe're also continuing to make meaningful progress in building new customer experiences that conveniently change what's possible for customers in our business long term. Amazon Business is one of our fastest growing offerings with a $35 billion annual gross sales run rate, and the team is working hard to further build out the selection, value, convenience, and features that business customers need. Buy with Prime is continuing to show a lot of progress. Merchants in early trials who use Buy with Prime saw their shopper conversion increase by 25% on average, which makes a real difference to their business. Also, merchants who participated in Prime Day activities in aggregate experienced a 10x increase in daily Buy with Prime orders during the sales event period versus the month before we announced Prime Day.\nIt's frankly only been a short amount of time that we've decided to invest significantly in the healthcare market segment. A lot of what we tried before were smaller experiments, but we're pleased with Amazon Pharmacy doubling its active customers in the past year. We're pleased with the response to our RxPass, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible generic medications for just $5 a month and have them delivered free to their door. One Medical has been part of Amazon for just a few months now, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there too. Our grocery business continues to grow.\nWe already have a very large business in non-temperature-controlled areas like consumables, pet food, beauty, and canned goods that continues to grow as we keep increasing speed and lowering our cost to serve, which allows us to sell more items more cost effectively. Whole Foods continues to lead the organic grocery space, is growing at a healthy clip, and has meaningfully improved its profitability in the last year. We're pleased with what we're seeing with Whole Foods, and as I've shared before, we're working on new formats in our mass physical store offering. Amazon Fresh has significantly improved a number of the key business inputs and just rolled out new concepts in stores. We also see substantial innovation and progress in other areas like Kuiper, Zoox, and Alexa.\nWe're still relatively early in many of our investments with technology inventions that are changing what's possible to deliver for customers in these areas, but they're big, long-term opportunities that we remain optimistic about. Finally, I want to recognize our teams on being named number one on LinkedIn's Top Companies to grow your career in the United States. It's a testament to our work to be a great employer with leading compensation, benefits, and upskilling opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we saw worldwide revenue of $134.4 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, and above the top end of our guidance range. We were encouraged by the strength in our reported revenue, which is another proof point that our focus on price, selection, and convenience continues to resonate with customers. We continue to see healthy demand across everyday essentials and in categories like beauty, health, and personal care, and have seen a positive customer response to improvements in personalization and enhancements to our website and mobile app during the quarter. We also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across our North America and international segments, yet continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases. Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters, and we reached record levels during Q2 Prime.\nMembers love the faster ship speeds, and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remains strong, up 22% year over year. Our performance-based advertising offerings continue to be the largest contributor to our growth. Our teams work to increase the relevancy of the ads we show to our customers by leveraging machine learning, and improve our ability to measure the return on advertising spend for brands. Third-party unit mix increased to 60% during the quarter, the highest level we have ever seen, and we're continuing to see good growth in the number of sellers, and the units sold per seller. We're making steady progress on improving our worldwide stores profitability. Since North America segment operating margins bottomed out in Q1 2022, we have seen five consecutive quarters of improvement, with second quarter operating margin of 3.9%.\nThis is an improvement of 620 basis points over these past five quarters. One of the largest drivers of this operating income improvement in the stores business has been reducing our cost to serve, with shipping costs and fulfillment costs continuing to grow at a slower pace than our unit growth. Most recently, regionalization is an important contributor. Faster delivery speed from better network connectivity and better inventory placement means less miles traveled and fewer touches, resulting in less cost. While we are pleased with the progress we have made, we see more opportunity to drive improved cost efficiencies going forward. Moving to the International segment, since our operating margin loss bottomed out in Q3 of last year, we have seen three consecutive quarters of improvement, with a second quarter margin loss of negative 3%. This is an improvement of 590 basis points over the last three quarters.\nThis segment also includes our emerging countries. It is important to remember how early we are in some of these marketplaces. We've launched more than 10 countries in the past six years and are always evaluating our customer experience, as well as our path to profitability. We like the path we're on. As a reminder, it took us nine years to reach profitability in the United States. In addition, across our North America and international results, inflation headwinds also continue to ease, most notably in fuel prices, line haul rates, ocean, and rail rates. Moving to AWS, year over year revenue growth was 12%. With growth rates stabilizing during Q2, we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline and believe having a large, diverse customer base that is mostly cost optimized sets us up well for future growth.\nOn a trailing twelve month basis, free cash flow is positive and improved for the fourth sequential quarter. Our financial focus remains on driving long term, sustainable free cash flows. The largest driver of the recent improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, most notably in the North America and international segments where, as I said, we've made meaningful improvement in our fulfillment network productivity and operating leverage, and benefited from moderating inflationary pressures. We've also seen improvements in our working capital contributions to free cash flow. Over the past couple of years, working capital hasn't been as efficient as we've held higher weeks of COVID inventory in the face of supply chain disruptions. Most recently, as these disruptions continue to ease, we're improving our inventory efficiency, resulting in improvements in our working capital. We will remain focused on continued free cash flow improvement moving forward.\nNext, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capital expenditures plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $54 billion for the trailing twelve month period ended 30 June 2023, down from $61 billion in the comparable prior year period. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be slightly more than $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year over year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touch tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nGreat, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first on the fulfillment efficiency, we'd be curious if you'd give us a sense for how much of that optimization in the network with unit economics may have already been achieved in these numbers versus how much more you think is left to go. Related to that, I'm curious if you can leverage this reformulated network to help out with the grocery expansion or will that be limited to the stores and the specialized automated facilities you're building out? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Colin. I'll take that first. On fulfillment efficiency, we're encouraged again by what we're seeing with regionalization, and also the efforts to control our cost structure and some of the inflationary pressures coming down. We're still, you know, in that journey though to reclaim the cost structure, the cost structure that we had previously. You consider this as a point along the road, so encouraged by some of the margin improvements we're seeing, particularly over the last three to five quarters. We're still underway. There's still a lot to be regained in our fulfillment area, and the teams are working very hard on it. On the question of grocery, you know, as Andy explained, at different points in our grocery business, it has a lot of dimensions to it. Obviously, there's consumables, there's fresh goods, there's Whole Foods.\nThe sub same day is probably mostly impacting the first of that bucket, the consumables and everyday essentials. As Andy mentioned, we're able to expand our selection in those areas because our cost structure can, quite frankly, afford it when the distances of customer are shorter and the transportation costs are more fixed.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYou know, I'll just add to that. This is Andy. I do think there's some optimization and some leverage we get from our fulfillment network, particularly in the case of being able to inject a number of items into our same day facilities to increase the number of items that people can add at the last minute, even grocery items that they can get same day. I think that you see some of that already. You'll see more of that moving forward. I also think that you'll see over time that we're going to be able to leverage being able to have people pick up different items from different grocery-like options that are different grocery formats. It's also true that we have infrastructure to build out in our grocery business that's different and optimized for the grocery business too.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nGreat.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nI'll limit myself to one question for each of you. Amazon Business. It's been a couple years since you've talked about that. It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunities, frankly, a lot higher level of sales, bookings, whatever that you get out of that. Andy, just talk about how big of a priority is that for you, and what's the growth strategy like? How do you take that to $100 billion? On the Brian on AWS, the last two quarters you provided a little bit of a look ahead into the quarter in terms of the AWS growth. Given some of the commentary about moving beyond optimization and into new workloads, if you don't give a specific number, at least talk about the trends that you're seeing versus what you had in the second quarter. Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with that second question. Again, if we rewind to our last conference call, we had seen 16% AWS revenue growth in Q1, and the growth rate had been dropping during the quarter. What I mentioned was that April was running about 500 basis points lower than Q1. What we've seen in the quarter is stabilization, and yes, you see the final 12% growth. I will stop for a moment, just put that in perspective. Again, last Q2 last year, we had close to $20 billion of revenue, and we grew that $2.4 billion. While that is 12%, there's a lot of cost optimization dollars that came out, and a lot of new workloads and new customers that went in.\nThere was, on our base, it's very large numbers, and when customers start to do the cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that. It's been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS, so that's all good. What we're seeing in the quarter is that those cost optimizations, while still going on, are moderating, and many may be behind us in some of our large customers. Now we're seeing more progression into new workloads, new business, so those balanced out in Q2. We're not going to give segment guidance for Q3, but you know what I would add is that we saw Q2 trends continue into July.\nGenerally feel business has stabilized, and we're looking forward to the back end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there's a lot of new functionality coming out, and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models, as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. Optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, I'll just underline one point Brian made, then quickly get to the Amazon business point. If you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size, with the amount of cost optimizing that's been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits. When I talked about last quarter, how I liked a lot of the fundamentals that we were seeing in the business with respect to the customer pipeline, the new workloads, the migrations happening, what the team was rolling out functionality wise, that's kind of what I'm talking about.\nAs we start to see cost optimization attenuate and more of the workloads, you know, new workloads that people took those cost optimizations and actually started to plan come to fruition. You know, not to mention what's coming with generative AI. There's a lot of growth in front of us in AWS. Just on your Amazon business question, Mark. You know, $35 billion annual run rate for gross sales is pretty strong growth. If you look at it year over year, it continues to be very strong. I like the way you're thinking, Mark, and it's almost like you're in some of the meetings that we're in where I asked the very same question. The team is working hard to build $100 billion plus business over time, and I think that the business has grown to be pretty large already.\nI still think we only have a fraction of the features that we need to address more of the enterprise at this point. There's all sorts of companies ordering obviously from Amazon business, but the bigger procurement workloads, there are certain features that you need to make that much easier in the way that companies are used to buying in those big procurements. We have a lot of features that we're adding. We have a number of service pieces that we need to add really around helping on big buys, do some of the service substantiations. We have a lot of functionality that we're very quickly adding to the mix here. I don't think we're close to being done growing there. That is a very strong area of focus for our stores team, and for our senior leadership team as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Thank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAndy, just on AI monetization, can you just talk to when you think you'll start to see that flow into the AWS business? Is that 2024, do you feel like the back half you'll start to see that as a bigger impact for the business?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, good question. What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years, and you've seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models in production on top of AWS and their compute instances. You've also seen it in the form of the 20+ machine learning services that we've had out there for a few years. I think when you're talking about the big potential explosion in generative AI, which everybody is excited about, including us, I think we're in the very early stages. There were a few steps into a marathon, in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know.\nI think it's really early. I think most companies are still figuring out how they want to approach it. They're figuring out how to train models. They want to, you know, they don't want to build their, you know, their own very large language models. They want to take other models and customize it, and services like Bedrock enable them to do so. It's very early. I expect that will be very large, but it will be in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question, and thanks for all the detail and the prepared remarks around framing some of those key issues. Andy, maybe coming back to grocery, there's been a lot of coverage in the press around your grocery initiative in the last couple of days. When you take a step back, how much do you think about solving the grocery dynamic in the business to capitalize on it the way you want? Is it an element of things you need to build and the application of capital versus elements of executing on what's already in place and sort of aligning the assets in place against the Amazon Prime households in your customer base? Thanks so much.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, it's a good question. It's a little bit of both. I mean, if I just step back and think about how we think about grocery, we continue to have this very big business in non perishables, which is where a lot of the mass merchandisers started in grocery several years ago. These are areas like consumables, canned goods, pet food, beauty, and health. As I said, it's a big business that's continuing to grow. If you want to be able to serve more customers, which we do, and there are a whole number of reasons for that and customers want it, you have to have a strong physical presence. You know, we started with Whole Foods, which is, you know, the pioneer in organic grocery and continues to be, and we really like the way Whole Foods is growing.\nWe've made a number of really important adjustments in the business. It's changed its profitability trajectory over the last year, and we really like where that's headed, and we're expanding that meaningfully. If you want to be really broad, you have to have a mass physical format. We have been working on that for several years with Amazon Fresh, and I would say that we weren't pleased with the inputs, the progress on the inputs there. The team has worked very hard over the last year to first start on the quality of the inputs, and that goes towards the quality of what we already had in place. These are things like the right in-stock levels, the right cost structure, the right figures on things like obsolescence, just a number of the core inputs there. We just felt like we could be sharper and better.\nI think that team has made up a lot of improvements. We have, you know, spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking how we want the formats to look. We've just started rolling out some of those new formats starting in our Chicago stores, moving to our Southern California stores shortly thereafter. You see added selection, you see added private brands, you see added well-known third-party brands like Krispy Kreme and Coffee. In the stores, you see a refined decor, you see refined dash carts that keep a running tally for people so they understand where they are at the moment, wherever they're shopping, as well as refined self-service checkouts.\nAll those things to me are part of an effort we're trying to pursue to have a format in our mass Amazon Fresh stores that resonate more with customers. We're hopeful that we will find that format and that it gives us the type of results that give us confidence to want to expand more broadly. We won't expand unless we see that type of resonance. We're not just going to be undisciplined, we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about it. I do think also you're starting to see across the team pulling some of the efforts together. We have a number of different grocery offerings that I just talked about. Just having a converged shopping cart for customers, which they have obviously wanted, that I think will help them quite a bit. We're continuing to extend delivery to non-Prime customers as well.\nYou know, I think there are a number of opportunities for us over time to grow the business. We're optimistic that we'll be able to do so. We're also being disciplined about not expanding the physical Fresh stores until we have a format that we think is pretty more resident with customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Andy, on the last call last quarter you talked about how you sort of talked about North America retail margins potentially getting to at or above pre-Covid levels. I think you just hit a margin around 4%, and you're sort of talking now about investing more in grocery and expanding same day and expanding that footprint. How should we think about the forward slope of North America retail margins and invest in some of these new initiatives in the retail business? The second one, on AI, how high of an investment priority is it for you to improve your own retail and device network through more AI investments, potentially through logistics or AI-based agents, et cetera? How large is that in the overall investment priority list?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nWell, I'll start on the North America retail piece, which is again, I'll just remind that we're not going to expand the number of Fresh stores in a very significant way until we believe we have something that is resonant with customers, and that we're going to like the return on invested capital. That, to me, I'm hopeful we're going to find that, but we won't until we do. You know, I think as it relates to same day facilities, we actually think that's going to be very positive for the business.\nIt is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, one of our most cost-effective mechanisms and fulfillment vehicles with respect, not just to getting it there to customers quickly, but being fast in part because those facilities, they're smaller facilities, they're big enough obviously to hold in steady state 100,000 SKUs and then also to have all of our nearby fulfillment centers be able to inject lots of different selection in there. We can cover several million SKUs in that same day or one day fashion. They're smaller in general. They're smaller facilities with less conveyance, and with more streamlined pick directly to pack and to get out to the dock to ship. They're just much more efficient as well.\nWe actually think that the expansion of those is going to not just help with speed and with demand, but we're going to also like the cost structure associated with that. You know, I continue to believe what I said last quarter, Brian, which is, you know, I do believe that we'll get back to margins like what we had pre Covid, and I don't think that's the end of what's possible for us there. On the AI question, what I would tell you is every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now, and they range from things that help us be more cost effective and streamlined in how we run operations in various businesses, to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer.\nIt's true in our stores business, it's true in our AWS business, it's true in our advertising business, it's true in all our devices, and you can just imagine what we're working on with respect to Alexa there. It's true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It is going to be at the heart of what we do, the significant investment and focus for it for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Just on AWS, as you lap optimizations and the macro driven slowdown, and you start to get the new workload deployment, how do you think about what normalized growth could look like for AWS in a better macro environment? Secondly, helpfully, get the just over $50 billion CapEx number for this year. Just curious how generative AI changes or could change your CapEx trajectory going forward. Thanks.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nWell, it's a good question, and I would say that while I expect there will continue to be cost optimization, I think that, you know, the balance of cost optimizations to actually new workloads and new migrations, as you know, we saw a shift in that in Q2, and I expect that we'll continue to see that shift over time. As I said, I mean, you have, everybody has to make their own conclusions on what percentage revenue growth they believe it means.\nYou know, to grow double digits on an $88 billion revenue run rate business, when you're seeing that amount of cost optimization, every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can the last year. To still grow double digits on a base that size means that we're acquiring a lot of new customers, and a lot of new workloads. You know, I'm very bullish on the growth of AWS over the next several years, and you know, any one quarter it's hard for me to predict, but I am bullish about it in the medium to long term for sure.\nYou know, I think that on the how much generative AI may impact the capital expense spend, you know, included in that number is a pretty significant amount of capital expense in the AWS business for large language models, and for generative AI, and we have quite a bit of demand right now. You know, it's like in AWS in general. One of the interesting things in AWS, and this has been true from the very earliest days, is the more demand that you have, the more capital you need to spend, you know, because you invest in data centers and hardware up front, and then you monetize that over a long period of time.\nI would like to have the challenge of having to spend a lot more in capital and generative AI because it will mean that customers are having success, and they're having success on top of our services. I think that that's our best estimate right now on that capital expense, and we'll update it if we find it different. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSam. Sa.",

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2023 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello and welcome to our Q1 2023 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.\nPlease note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 27, April 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nOur guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I am joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments regarding our Q1 results. Let's begin with revenue. For the Q1, our worldwide net sales were $127.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 11% excluding approximately 210 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was above the top end of our guidance range.\nOverall, we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing in worldwide stores businesses, including quarter over quarter revenue acceleration in the international segment, which was helped by easing macroeconomic pressures in Europe. Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection, and easier and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continue to improve throughout the Q1.\nThat said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it's continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further, and are focused on value. We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories, as well as shifts to lower priced items, and healthy demand in everyday essentials such as consumables and beauty.\nThird party sellers, including businesses who elect to utilize Fulfillment by Amazon for their storage and shipping services, are a key contributor to the selection offered to customers. We also continue to invest meaningfully in brand protection efforts, including industry-leading technology, so that sellers can trust we will provide a great selling experience free from bad actors. Sellers comprise 59% of overall unit sales in Q1, up from 55% one year ago.\nWe also saw strong engagement in our advertising services, with revenue up 23% year over year, excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, our Sponsored Products and brand offerings remain a key driver of growth, as we work with advertisers to help customers make more informed purchase decisions. Our teams remain focused on delivering performance through our comprehensive and flexible measurement capabilities, along with insights that allow advertisers the ability to measure their return on their advertising spend and help them grow their business.\nIn AWS, net sales were $21.4 billion in the Q1, up 16% year-over-year and representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, customers of all sizes and all industries continue to look for cost savings across their businesses, similar to what you've seen us doing at Amazon.\nAs expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the Q1, and we are seeing these optimizations continue into the Q2, with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. As a reminder, we're not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We're working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us.\nTherefore, our AWS sales and support teams continue to spend much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so that they can better weather this uncertain economy. This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the Q1, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range.\nThis operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS. As we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business as well as Twitch, Devices, Advertising, and our human resources teams.\nIn Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores, revenue, and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continue to ease quarter over quarter, primarily driven by reductions in line haul shipping rates as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements.\nWe exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network, and leveraged that throughout Q1, with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we're able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our US fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time. We reported overall net income of $3.2 billion in the Q1.\nWhile we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $467 million included in non operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather to quarter to quarter fluctuations in Rivian stock price. Turning to cash flows, we remain focused on building long term, sustainable growth, and free cash flow, including our efforts towards a strong, cash flow accretive working capital cycle.\nOur operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended 31 March 2024 increased to $54.3 billion, up 38% versus a comparable period year-over-year. Besides the cash benefit of improved profitability year-over-year, we've also seen supply chains easing up and made progress to improve our inventory, purchasing, and payment cycles, which in turn has a positive impact on working capital. Now let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases for the full year 2023.\nWe expect capital investments to be lower than our $59 billion investment level in 2022, primarily driven by an expected year over year decrease in fulfillment network investments. We're continuing to invest in infrastructure to support AWS customer needs, including investments to support large language models and generative AI. Before we open the call up for your questions, I'll hand it over to Andy to share some high level perspectives on the Q1.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Brian, I'll share a few thoughts before opening up for questions. From my perspective, I think there's a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, and the results we're starting to see in our storage business. We've been very focused on reducing our cost to serve in our fulfillment network. As we've shared in the past, given the unexpected surge in demand during the pandemic, we doubled the size of our fulfillment center footprint and largely built a transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years.\nThis ended up substantially changing the number of nodes and connections in our fulfillment network, and as a result, we spent the last several months not only redesigning dozens of processes to drive better productivity, but also rearchitecting our placement approach and larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network in the US to a regional one. It means we've created eight interconnected regions in geographic areas, with each of these regions having broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary.\nWe just recently completed this rollout and are quite bullish on the early results. Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve, and customers getting their orders faster. While on the topic of delivery speed, we're really excited about our progress in providing customers more one day and same day deliveries and are on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. On the advertising side, we're continuing to buck wider advertising trends and deliver robust growth. I think there are a few reasons for it.\nFirst, even in difficult economies, most people still shop, and with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers the companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they're looking for various items, has meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise on Amazon.\nIt's also worth noting that we're still very early in our efforts to find a way to thoughtfully place ads in our broader video, live, sports, audio, and grocery properties. We have a lot of upside still in advertising in AWS. What we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can. Right now they tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences.\nOne of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premises infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time, and given that it's best for customers long term, we've been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We've spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we're seeing, and I've spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well. We like the fundamentals of what we're seeing in AWS.\nThe new customer pipeline looks strong, the set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong, the product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling, and people sometimes forget that 90+% of global IT spend is still on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it's going to move to the cloud. Having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best security and operational performance, and the largest and partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. We're not close to being done inventing in AWS.\nOur recent announcement on large language models and generative AI, and the chips and managed services associated with them, is another recent example. In my opinion, few folks appreciate how much new cloud business will happen over the next several years from the pending deluge of machine learning that's coming. This past year has seen us do a fair bit of cost streamlining. As I mentioned in my recent shareholder letter, we took a deep look across the company and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative's long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital.\nIn some cases, it led us to shuttering certain businesses like our physical bookstores, Four Star Stores, Amazon Fabric, Amazon Care, and certain devices where we didn't see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren't producing the returns we'd hoped. An example is free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35, and changed them. We also made the very difficult decision to eliminate about 27,000 corporate roles.\nLike most leadership teams, we'll continue to evaluate what we're seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. While we've taken several actions to streamline our costs, we've been able to do so while still pursuing the key strategic, long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully make customers' lives better, and potentially change what Amazon is.\nThese are investments both in our larger businesses mentioned earlier, as well as in areas like international expansion in our stores business, large retail market segments in which we're still nascent like grocery and business to business, allowing consumers to use Prime off of Amazon in our Buy with Prime program, entertainment devices, health care, and our low Earth orbit satellite for the hundreds of millions of households, companies, and government entities that have limited to no connectivity.\nIt's hard to predict that all of these will be successful, but only one or two working would change our business over the long term. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I like the direction we're headed and strongly believe our best days are in front of us. With that, I'll open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now open the call for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handset to provide the optimal sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touchtone telephone at this time. Thank you, and please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions. Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead, and when do you start to lap some of those efforts? Also, on the CapEx side, I think you said overall CapEx would be down in 2023. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? What's required on CapEx from a generative AI and large language model perspective?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nThanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThis is Brian. I'll take the first or the second part of that question. First, on CapEx, we spent $59 billion, excuse me, last year. On our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year over year. Those estimates are going down, the gap or the increases in AWS and infrastructure. We are adding more dollars for large language models and generative AI. We're creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that is being repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined CapEx will be lower year over year.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nJust on your first question, Doug, you know, it's hard to say exactly where we are in the process. You know, I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they're, you know, they're appropriately cautious about what they're seeing in the economy, and they're trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own.\nYou know, we have a long track record which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term. We're not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We're going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we're trying to build relationships in a business that outlasts all of us.\nWe're spending a lot of time with customers trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. One of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up. When you don't have that demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. That is not true with what you see on premises. We're trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it's important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost-cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud.\nThis is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experiences that change what's possible. You know, I think if you think about, you know, those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you're reallocating, you're reprioritizing, you're redefining what you're going to build. You got to actually go build it before you can implement it. We're working pretty, pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives.\nI think it's important to remember that there's still so much growth ahead of the cloud. 90+% of the global IT spend is on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, you know, it's mostly moving to the cloud. I also think that there are a lot of folks that don't realize the amount of non consumption right now that's going to happen and be spent in the cloud. With the advent of large language models and generative AI, I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven't existed before, and that's all going to be spent, in my opinion, on the cloud.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions, Andy. You've talked a lot in the letter, the shareholder letter, and on the last earnings call about driving greater levels of efficiencies in the company and also possibly returning to some of the margin structures we saw pre pandemic and absorbing overcapacity that built up during the pandemic. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nEric. This is Brian. Let me start on the financial part of that question. I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre pandemic levels. He's talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations. We've obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we're in over the last six to nine months and have made adjustments there. There's still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side.\nIf you look at our operating margin, North America for example, North America segment, it was 1.2% this quarter. Pre-pandemic, that number was in the 46% range broadly. It's a bit of a marker on how much upside. There's a lot of moving parts in that number. Obviously, there's the advertising, there's investments going on for future growth, and there's the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. Making progress, working hard at it. It's a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nI would just add to that that, you know, we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. I think that while it's probably most visible given the size of it, what's, you know, the improvement in the operating margin, the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard on finding ways to be more efficient. You know, as Brian said, I think we're making really, really good progress, the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business.\nOne of the things that's been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we, over the last six to nine months as the network fundamentally changed, remember when you go through as much growth as we went through and you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple years, there's a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want.\nWe've spent a lot of time working on that the last six to nine months. Some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows of the curve and scale, when they become inefficient because network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. It's part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about. It also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last six to nine months.\nWe have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before. I'm pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there's additional upside with some of the opportunities we've identified.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there's a lot of discussion about AWS's competitive positioning when it comes to these tools. Could you just sort of walk us through two or three of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers in AI tools versus some of the competitors? The second one, around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be as leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new large language models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward, and what's your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah, I'll try and answer those together because they're somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it's useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25+ years at Amazon. It's deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do. It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations, it drives the pickpass in our fulfillment centers, we have it in our ghost stores, we have it in our Prime Air, our drones, it's obviously in Alexa, and then AWS. We have 25 machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. It is deeply ingrained in our heritage.\nI think if you look at what's happened over the last nine months or so, these large language models and generative AI capabilities, they've been around for a while, but frankly the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago. They have gotten so much bigger and so much better much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don't exist that weren't really that easily made possible before. It's very early days in that space.\nProbably not surprisingly, we've been investing and building in our own large language models for several years and we have a very large investment across the company. The way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there's three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here, all of the large language models are going to run on compute, and the key to that compute is going to be the chips that's in that compute.\nTo date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they're expensive and they're scarce. It's hard to find enough capacity. In AWS, we've been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips. We built a chip that's specialized for training, machine learning training, which we call Trainium, and a chip that's specialized for inference, or the predictions that come from the model, called Inferentia. The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training.\nAs these models graduate to production, where they're in the apps, all the spend is going to be in inference. They both matter a lot. If you look at we just released our second versions of both training and Inferentia, the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. We think that a lot of that machine learning training inference will run on AWS. If you think about it, you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, but you have to build the models.\nIf you look at the really significant leading large language models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build. There will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money. We will be one of them at Amazon, but most companies don't. What most companies really want, and what they tell AWS, is that they'd like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data, their own needs, and customer experience.\nThey want to do it in a way where they don't leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model. That's what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It's a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we're exposing ourselves, which we call Titan, or they can run it from leading large language model providers like AI21, Anthropic, and Stability AI.\nThey can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes, and then be able to run it with the same security, privacy, and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS. That's very compelling for customers. That third layer is really the applications that are going to be built on top of those large language models. ChatGPT is a good example of an application that's being built. We'll build some of those applications ourselves.\nFor instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding. We built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in in natural language. You know, something like, I want to build a video hosting website, and CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling.\nIf you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they're going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that, you know, is knitting and takes time, I think it's a big deal. Now to your second question. It's related to this top layer I was just talking about. We're going to build every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon are building on top of large language models to reinvent our customer experiences. You'll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertainment, and devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that.\nI think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. We have a vision, which we have conviction about, that we want to build the world's best personal assistant. To do that, it's difficult, it's across a lot of domains, and it's a very broad surface area.\nHowever, if you think about the advent of large language models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective, such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building that world's best personal assistant. I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have, you know, a couple hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment, shopping, smart home, and information, and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners.\nWe've had a large language model underneath it, but we're building one that's much larger, much more generalized, and capable. I think that's going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world's best personal assistant. I think there's a significant business model underneath it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat .Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off on the international segments, I mean, not only an acceleration there on the top line, but also on the margin side, if you could maybe add a little more color on some of the initiatives and improvements there. Secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe Andy, it would be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories, and if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks, Colin. I'll start with the international question. Yeah, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. You know, I think the economy there is starting to stabilize, especially in established countries of Europe. We're seeing consumer confidence has increased, and inflation is ticking down. Some of those are similar to North America. That is what we probably had some upside that we weren't counting on international in the Q1, and that was good strength on the margin.\nThe negative margin has come down. Top line is helping there. It's also a function of some of the reductions that we're making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but you'll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency, and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international.\nI will remind you though again that international is an aggregation of established countries, which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries ahead of the curve that we saw in North America. Happy there we have a large emerging business. In the last five years, we've added more than 10 new countries. What we're seeing is if you look back to North America long ago, it took nine years for us to reach break-even profitability in the United States.\nWe see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. In fact, there are additional challenges that we usually have to deal with. Things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure, especially for transportation and infrastructure for the Internet and everything else. The adoption can be slower. We feel good about the businesses we're building.\nThey carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America. Price, selection, and convenience are at the core of that. Very happy with the adoption, traffic, and new customer acquisition that we're seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. Good quarter, continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nOn the grocery part, what I would say is, you know, we continue to progress there. You know, we have a, we have an interesting grocery business where we've been in it for a while, and we've actually quite a large grocery business. It's just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection are items that are not temperature controlled.\nIt's canned goods, packaged food, paper products, pet supplies, personal care, health and beauty, and all sorts of consumables. Interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. We continue to be very pleased with that part of our grocery business.\nTo serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with, we have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We've got two efforts there. We've got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space, and that continues to grow nicely. We've made a number of changes in the last year to the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there, and feel very good about that.\nYou know, at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. If you really want to serve as much of grocery as we'd like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. That's what we've been working on for a few years with the brand we've called Amazon Fresh.\nWe wish we were further along at this point. We've tried lots of ideas. We haven't yet found conviction around format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments, ideas, and concepts that we're working on across our dozens of stores there. We're pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work, and we're hopeful over this next year we find that. We continue to believe it's a big business for us today. It's continuing to get bigger, and we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly.\nI think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for, as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Guess AWS, can you call out any unusual items in April or Q2 for the comp? I know you had a very good Q2 last year, just thinking about linearity in the quarter. Second, Andy, really appreciated the shareholder letter. It looks like you've picked Medical and Kuiper as big investment areas. Do you think those, I mean, why those areas? Does the company ever think about breaking out all the big investments, so we had more clarity on the retail margin structure? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nHi Justin. Thank you. On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we're seeing among customers right now and where they're cutting workloads, and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them, and planning for the future. We feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we're doing to help customers save money. I would say Q2 versus Q1, there's not an obvious year-over-year comp differential.\nIt's just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others, and helping them get on, hopefully, to the new initiatives that they are planning as well.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon\n\nYeah. In terms of calling out healthcare and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing and how we think about our big new investments that we make. I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if it's successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere?\nDo we have some kind of differentiation, and do we have some competence at the company in that area? If not, can we acquire it quickly? We'd like the answers to those questions. We will invest. Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business, and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in, business to business, our Amazon Business entity, and grocery, and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime benefit on other third-party websites beyond Amazon, and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and then get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime.\nThere are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes do not lead to categories that people might initially guess. AWS was a good example of that, where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003. We're a pretty different company because we did so even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought it was a little bit crazy. I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two. I chose two that we have conviction about.\nYou know, on the healthcare side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments. You know, healthcare is a multi-trillion dollar business that's very segmented, and it's really broken in the US particularly. I think in other parts of the world too, but particularly in the US, and we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at it.\nI think when, you know, our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy. If you think about that, it's not, you know, that's a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail. We launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and, you know, I think it's off to a good start. It's continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. You know, a lot of our customers who like that experience said, gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader healthcare experience. If you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it.\nIf you look at the experience that's been the case for the last several decades, you know, we're going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment. You had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment, drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, get into the facility, and wait 20 minutes in reception. Then you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in, the doctor talks to you for five minutes, and then prescribes you medicine, where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. That experience just doesn't make sense and won't be the case.\nYou know, we looked at, we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn't believe how much people liked a streamlined experience. We ultimately decided we didn't have the right business model there. We came across One Medical where, you know, the digital app is very compelling, and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference. If you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country, and you can get that appointment same day or next day.\nIn all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists where you're plugged into their ability to get reservations, where you can get reservations in a day or two there. When you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It's a very, very different experience. We think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience. If we're successful with primary care and with health, with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. We think that's a big opportunity.\nI'll just briefly say on Kuiper that, you know, it's a very large number. It's hundreds of millions of households, businesses, and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the Internet. If you just think about what you can't do if you don't have connectivity, we all take it for granted. You know, having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business, or you can enjoy entertainment, or you can shop for anything you can imagine.\nFor businesses and governments to be able to have that coverage, to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it's a total game changer. We think it has the chance to be a very large business. We haven't, you know, we've released some information about it and some of our designs, and it's pretty exciting to us how many customers, you know, in all those different segments are excited about it.\nI just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess, but that we think can be very significant for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Sa.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2022 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q4 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 2 February 2023, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.\nOur results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nThank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue. For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year over year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money. Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these.\nThis past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery, and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work. In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty, and soft lines.\nOur teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations, as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection. In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors, and brands continued to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets. We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nPrime membership continues to be a great value for our customers, and improving our Prime benefits is a continuous part of our investment strategy. Along with competitive pricing, broad selection, and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings. During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the most-watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013, and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18 to 34-year-olds.\nIn aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports, and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on this spend, and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition. Moving on to AWS, net sales increased to $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year over year, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rate slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.\nAs expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings, and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA, and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far, in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.\nThat said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term. Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. This operating income was negatively impacted by three large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment, and operating leases, and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business.\nWe entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time, and drive productivity gains. We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon logistics productivity and improved linehaul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers in line with our plan. We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network, and reducing our costs to serve our customers while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.\nCircling back to the three large charges during the quarter, let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we considered the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores, device businesses, as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance costs of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment, and general administration on our income statement. Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand, and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time.\nAs such, we periodically assess our portfolio stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized cost and associated values of our leased buildings. The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement. We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup, or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement.\nAs our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims. We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience.\nWe believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. Hey, everybody. This is Andy. Just before we started the questions, I just wanted to say it's good to be with you all on the call today. I thought I might jump on the calls from time to time moving forward. Given that this last quarter was the end of my first full year in this role, and given some of the unusual parts in the economy and our business, I thought this might be a good one to join. Thanks for having me.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star and then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hol\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while. As you sit there, what are your key focal points, product categories, or investment priorities that you're most focused on to drive durable multi-year growth in that North America retail segment as we recover? The second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? What are the warehouse network and what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nBrian, this is Brian first. Let me just start with your second question. On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020, we were just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America. We had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last three years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls. Essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the, and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last two, three years now.\nWe also look at all the investment areas that we're working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make mid-course corrections, where we need to change things up. We expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. We hope to make, and expect to make, big improvements in 2023.\nYeah. I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise. The connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly invent to do so. Being maniacally focused on the customer experience is always going to be a top priority for us. At the same time, and this is true in North America as well as across the entire business, we're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments that we believe can meaningfully change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over the long term.\nAs I address directly the North American stores questions, I think probably the number one priority that I spend time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve and our operations network. As Brian touched on it, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we took a fulfillment center footprint that we built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. We, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile, roughly the size of UPS, in a couple of years. When you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, just to get those functional, it took everything we had. There's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive.\nI think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network, and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. To figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and to have them be highly utilized, and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, takes time. We're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. That work will extend into 2023. That's first. I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed.\nWe believe that continuing to get products to customers faster makes customers happier, and they also convert at a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the US, and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners. We work very hard to provide unmatched selection, and that matters a lot to customers.\nI think pricing being sharp is always important, particularly in this type of uncertain economy where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending. Having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing. Just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon, or adding RxPass in the healthcare space where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all their medicines they're using in unlimited fashion.\nWhether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking at clothing, you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and changes your customer experience, your buying experience. We will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Also for Andy, I have two. First, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know it's a huge market you're attacking at different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share? Secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like healthcare, Kuiper, and autonomous vehicles, among others? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nOn the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. We also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them. There are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. You're going to also see a hybrid of those where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores, and there's something that's not in inventory in the store, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online.\nI think having omnichannel is going to really matter. I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that, and that we've been building for a long time. It's continuing to accelerate. I kind of see it broken into a few pieces. If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. If you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products, to canned goods, to pet supplies, to health and personal care items, to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and that we think will continue to grow. It doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables.\nIf you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. We have kind of two different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that that business has made on profitability in the last year. I like what I see in front of it. I think that's a very—it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space. I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. That's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh. We have a few dozen stores so far.\nWe're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers, is differentiated in some meaningful fashion, and where we like the economics. We've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh stores until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like. We're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. When we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much. Maybe I'll ask one big picture of Andy and then just a housekeeping matter to Brian if I can. Andy, keeping on this theme of sort of big picture and strategy and your perspective, I'd love to get your view on the international e-commerce businesses. Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today and how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead? Maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up.\nIn the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company's made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you framed the Q1 operating income guidance? Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nSure. Let me start with this, Brian. Let me start with that second part. As I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1, into mid to late January. The way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first three weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. The period after that, where there's weeks of or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. I hope that helps.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nOn the question about international e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about the business we're building there. I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to 2021, in the UK, it was over 30%. In Germany, it was 26%. In Japan, it was 21%. The fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories. We're excited about that. At this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well.\nIf you just look in Europe as an example, the inflation is higher than most places, and the impact on Europeans for the war in Ukraine is more significant. Also, the energy prices and hikes there are more significant. You can see that in some of our growth numbers. Yeah. You look at our emerging countries, and they're all a little bit different and in a little bit different stage, as you recognize in the question. If you look at countries like India, Brazil, the Middle East, Africa, Turkey, Mexico, Australia, and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time.\nThere's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. They're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies. We think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large, profitable international e-commerce business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nWall Street Analyst, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe one for Andy and then one for Brian. AWS, if you look at the revenue growth to mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish, even down this quarter. Maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on. Then second, when do you think this could recover? What's the timeframe? Would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nThanks, Justin, for your question. This is Brian. Let me start with what we're seeing at the customer level. As I've mentioned, continuing across all industries, there are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do have mortgage volumes down. Some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is less, lower trading in crypto, and things tied to advertising. As there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics compute on advertising spend as well. There are selective things. By and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn. We're doing the same thing at Amazon. We're questioning our infrastructure expenses as well as everything else. There are things you can do. You can defer. You can switch to lower-cost products.\nYou can run calculations less frequently. You can do different types of storage on your data. There are ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. As I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. Again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. I'll let Andy add some color on the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nYeah. I would just add, and I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise. We're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. When you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can spend less money and where companies can cost optimize. In some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information, and they say, well, can I get away with it for two weeks, doing two weeks' worth? It's not necessarily the best thing long-term, but a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situations.\nThe reality is that the way that we are, the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year. We're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlasts all of us. If it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost-effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that. It's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up.\nIf it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. That elasticity is very unusual. It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud and AWS are very effective for customers. Yeah. I think I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this. When we look closely at what we see, we have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge. That often means moving to the cloud.\nWe see a number of those pieces as well. We're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. It's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. To our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year over year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security, operational performance, and a larger partner ecosystem. I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. If you believe that that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away.\nI really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at and invent, which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed.\n\nRon Josey\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup Inc\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger high-level question here just around Prime member engagement and to seeing third-party seller services growth accelerating in the quarter. I believe it was mentioned that customers are spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk to us a little bit more, maybe, Andy and Brian, just around how engagement's evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nYeah, thanks, Ron, for your question. I would say that the Prime membership remains strong, and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. In general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. We know that, again, investments like that will help with not only new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. We see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website. The health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments.\nWe think that will also be well received by Prime members. The combination of price, selection, and convenience, I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. I think the testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter in a very competitive and deal-driven environment. People came, Prime members and others, came to Amazon to do their shopping. We're encouraged by it.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nJust to add really one piece here, which is just if you step back and think about a lot of subscription programs, there are a number of them that are $14, $15 a month really for entertainment content, which is more than what Prime is today. If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side, you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere, you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit, you get the photos benefit, you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon, and some of the grocery benefits that we provide.\nRxPass, like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited. That is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. We will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. It's still early days. As we continue to make the service better and better and fully featured, we see people continuing to spend more at Amazon across our various businesses. We're optimistic about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. Two questions. Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly continuing deterioration in enterprise demand? Andy, I wonder at a high level, you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. It looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores except for groceries, and it may be a little bit more of a lean-in on health. I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more.\nAt a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nHi, Mark. On the AWS growth rate, I'm not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. This is a bit uncharted territory economically. As we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing. I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work to be there for our customers. As I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value is there, and whether there's perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there.\nI think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly. There's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that, and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud. We'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today.\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nCEO, Amazon.com, Inc\n\nYeah. I would say I think for any leadership team, each era is different, and it's often meaningfully impacted by what's happening around you. I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic, the labor shortage in 2021, the war in Ukraine, inflation, and an uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses. If you look at in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers, and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we were going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed.\nYou saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothball some of our facilities to try and be more economic. I think when we looked at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we did not have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. That is why we closed down our four-star bookstores.\nAs we got into the early part of the summer where we start our operating planning process, and there was a lot of things happening in the macroeconomy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of, we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs. In all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making, we want to actually do a pretty good thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time. You saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy.\nWe eliminated some programs in Fabric.com, Amazon Care, Amazon Glow, and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out. We went a little bit slower on some devices until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles. Those were all done with an eye towards trying to streamline our costs, but still be able to invest in the things that we think really matter over the long term. Now, we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong.\nIt's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach, and do we have some competence in those areas? If we don't, can we acquire them quickly? If we like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Sometimes that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. When we expanded into music, video, and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people.\nAmazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools that seemed far afield for people, but it turned out not to be. When we launched something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. I remember I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience having worked with a team and led the team from the very start. I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. Think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS. That informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, retail, and advertising AWS businesses.\nI think that while we've gone slower in some devices things, we still, when we look at the answers to those four questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment, devices, our Go Earth, Orbit satellite, and Kuiper, healthcare, and a few other things. I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time. I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we streamline our costs. I think you see a lot of that. We're also going to continue to invest for the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, 27th October 2022, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nThis guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining today's call. Before we move to questions, I would like to make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance, which represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever.\nWe've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. We're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our US conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new email marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates, and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. This was a big quarter for Prime members.\nWe celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. We also debuted the two largest Prime Video releases ever. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day. In the first two months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the three biggest hours of US Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon.\nOur next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings, where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers' focus on controlling costs, and we're proactively working to help customers cost-optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS's history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty.\nThe breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tier options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. Graviton3 processors deliver 40% better price performance than comparable 86-based instances, and our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT FleetWise. We continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia-Pacific region in Thailand. Now let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income.\nTurning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements, driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements on our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned. We are encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, though we recognize there is still a lot of opportunity to continue to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies throughout our networks. We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead.\nAnother impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of The Rings of Power, and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by non-recurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products, such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com, and Amazon Explore. We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders, sales, and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses, and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services, and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Overall, stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter.\nThis increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $1.1 billion, included in non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021.\nThis represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year, as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. This is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation, and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide. The continuing impacts of broad-scale inflation, heightened fuel prices, and rising energy costs have impacted our sales growth, as consumers assess their purchasing power, and organizations of all sizes evaluate their technology and advertising spend.\nAs the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses, as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds I mentioned earlier. We expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long term, while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. That is where our efforts remain focused.\nAs we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale event, where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks, and with that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. Brian, maybe I'll just ask a two-parter with respect to the revenue guide for Q4. Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the US e-commerce business or the AWS business, and how that might inform some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the US e-commerce side? Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year. FX is a bigger issue for us on our revenue growth in dollars than it is on our income. Actually, it's a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. Put that aside for a moment. What we're seeing, what we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. The resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery rate speed was coming back. That continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. Primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international.\nNorth America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. It was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Even if compared to the US, it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy price issues have really compounded in that geography. When I talk about enterprise customers and AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market.\nI would say this is one of the real valuable points about cloud computing, that it's turning fixed costs into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips are many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost-performance ratios. While we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you notice we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3. The business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting the budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth range.\nWe've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption.We're excited about the re:Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas, and many more tuning in virtually. We continue to drive value for customers with new products, new services, and, lately, also additional ways for them to manage their budgets and optimize in what is shaping up as a tough economy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, free cash flow generation has always been Amazon's focus in the past, but that went negative last year and likely this year as well. Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? Do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. If you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the generally 12 months versus the 12 months before it. A lot of that is driven to our things that we've talked about on these calls, ops cost. We're still not in a our network doubled over the last two and a half years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still have work to do there. We have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company, and mostly in operations. There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover, mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily, and same with our sellers too. We just have additional weeks of cover.\nWe think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain, and having more in stock. What the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last two years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We've probably cut about a third of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022, while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business.\nWe're working hard on all those dimensions, and we expect, as we see a recovery in income generation, normalization of the inventory versus accounts payable cycle, and efficiency in our CapEx spend, we intend to flip those numbers around.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nLet me ask two prompted questions. AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just the reflection of the full quarter impact of that kind of stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Any commentary on is that the new normal for AWS margins? International losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought. Just talk about what drove those losses, and is that also the new normal for that segment? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure. Let me start with AWS. We did see a deceleration of or drop in op margin sequentially over the quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. There's moving parts there. I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year, and particularly our tech employees, and it's heavily concentrated in AWS. That's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity, and the impact of natural gas pricing.\nThose prices are up more than two times over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus two years ago. We're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. Yeah, we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. As we scale, we will kind of run into that. We'll outrun that growth trajectory. On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. The biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2, was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more so than in the United States.\nPrime Day is always a bit of has lesser profitability because there's a lot of deals, and it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. We also had a big part of that is device sales. Again, we sell a lot of devices during our Prime Day events. We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. That always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. There are some contributing things. As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal. We'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements, are as important internationally as they are in North America.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nBrian, on AWS, I'm just curious when you talk about optimizing and efficiency, can you talk to what you're seeing from your customers, why perhaps you're seeing such a big pullback in terms of near-term demand? How would you characterize those conversations? The other question is related to backlog. Backlog's been running 60%+, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence?\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nLet me have Dave answer the backlog question first.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. It's Dave here. Our current backlog balance for Q3 is $104 billion. That's a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. The new customer pipeline's healthy. With a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. Brian, I'll talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth is figured. It can fluctuate quarter to quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you do sign in the period and how those adjust. Yeah, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. Your first question about cost optimization. First, there are some industries that have lower demand that's strung up in our volumes, just probably other companies as well. Things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies have been down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. Basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend. We have options for them to do that. They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost-performance ratios. All really good things for the customer and for Amazon long-term.\nWe think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other costs of electricity and everything else. They can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. This is just like in 2020. These time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. The opposite in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there was a yeah, there were companies that went down, and there were companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing really high volumes during the pandemic. That dynamic's not in place right now.\nEveryone's just cautious, and they want to, again, watch their spend. I, CFO, appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Blackledge\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Cowen\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? Second, on the holiday season, it's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious how your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure. Let me start with the holiday. We're ready to roll. We've got the best in selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. We're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. The P's, or the, excuse me, the Prime Early Access Sale create a great value for consumers, allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday, and also just find some great deals. We're happy with that effort, and the teams that put that together worked very hard this year to hold two large Prime events within four months. We're very optimistic about the holiday, but we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets.\nWe're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. We're ready for a variety of outcomes. We know the consumers, when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising, and our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. We have a lot of advantages that we feel will help both consumers and also our partners, like sellers and advertisers. The seller in stock is very high. We've had great demand or great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. We're ready to go, and we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for, and we are. On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world.\nWe made, there's three large buckets there, as I've said in the past: productivity, fixed cost leverage, and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there. We know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter because it's just a period of maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. Our goal is to leave ourselves in really good, strong condition for a fast start on 11 initiatives in Q1 of next year. On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability, and we've tightened that up.\nFeel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation's a wild card. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that use a lot of fuel, or use a lot of trucking, or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world. We're working under the umbrella of not having an impact to customer. We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. We'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. Just two clarifications on what you just said. First, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in Q3, and you'd talked about a billion and five. As we move forward, if those three areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that one year, two years, any time frame on that? Then on AWS, you said the back half of Q3 was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in Q4. Could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in Q4, or are some of the price concessions you already made in Q3 kind of getting in front of that? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nWas that second question on AWS, Ross?\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, AWS trajectory. Exactly.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nI got it. Okay. Let me start with the efficiency. I just outlined a lot of it in the prior answer, but just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion of improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that, primarily in mostly in our productivity. We had a lot of with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses, but our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. In that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints.\nWe will continue that fight. While I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm really only talking about Q4, my message is that we have work to do in 2023 that we are aware of and working on today. Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS?\n\nDave Fildes\n\nVP Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. This is Dave. Yeah, Ross, you were just asking around AWS. There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he'd spoken about we've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as third quarter progressed and exited sort of in the mid-20s growth rate. That's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter. Nothing else to add on that. Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining today's call. Before we get to questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed, and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% YoY, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021.\nWhile demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high growth period depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months, ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines had become more available, particularly in the United States, and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 YoY revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on 12 and 13 July 2022 and is incorporated into our Q3 guidance. As the impacts of the last two years are normalizing, we're happy with how we've served customers, and how they've responded.\nOur compound annual growth since the start of the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members, and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. We continue to improve the customer experience in Q2, including QoQ improvements in delivery speed and inventory in-stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improve the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network. We have slowed our 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans to better align with expected customer demand. While there's still work to be done, we've made good progress in Q2.\nOur Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on 2 September 2022, and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football Games starting 15 September 2022. Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners helped to expand the selection we can offer customers, while Fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business: inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity, and fixed cost deleverage.\nRecall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the Q2, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air, and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we continued to improve delivery route density and improve package deliveries per hour. We're encouraged by the progress during the quarter, and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year.\nLastly, the YoY negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are two main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday-level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021. Second is the normal step-down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in the first half of 2022. On the first point, we expect this challenging YoY comp will have ended in Q2. On the second point, we expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity. We have also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. Let's turn to AWS.\nWe saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% YoY, and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we're still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services, and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to startups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom, and Jefferies Financial Group, to name a few, announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS.\nAWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers, as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity, and a little less than 25% was for transportation. The remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores.\nFor full year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow YoY, primarily to support the rapid growth and innovation we're seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand. We expect both fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the Q2.\nWhile we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in non-operating expense, from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the US, we have started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the US by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per-share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on 27 May 2022. We also provided our Q3 financial guidance as part of our earnings release.\nAgain, a reminder that this year our Prime Day sales event occurred on 12 July and 13 July and is incorporated into our Q3 guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from YoY change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. Our Q3 operating income guidance range is $0 to 3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This Q3 guidance assumes we see approximately $1.5 billion in QoQ sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS, and additional digital content for Prime members.\nFor AWS, these QoQ increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world in operating our AWS data centers. QoQ increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime Video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Thank you, and now let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality.\nOnce again, to initiate a question, please press star then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I wanted to talk a little bit about the bridge from Q2 to Q3 EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the one and a half billion QoQ, and some of the incremental investments in content, etc. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow, and is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one.\nThe second one is kind of going back to your comment about how you've slowed 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx, sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, nine months? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. In any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year, is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity. That'll be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. There's always a pre-spend to keep, again, the pipeline moving. When we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022.\nAgain, we have moved things out, and capital is coming down in those areas, as we just mentioned. We'll just have to keep you posted as we go quarter to quarter on what our expectations are. On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, you have the mentioned three items: the ops improvement that we see of $1.5 billion, and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS as we build out depreciation. We also are continuing to add people in that space: product engineers, salespeople, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity. It's early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments, and we invest with that confidence in mind. Customers have responded, and we're going to keep investing there. Your comment on discounting, we're not seeing some of the pressures that other people are seeing right now.\nOur macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation, and we've been pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp-up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. That's probably the new information. The other inflationary factors, well, some of them are coming down slightly. They're still significantly a penalty YoY. Other cost pressures are principally on our cost of employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points QoQ as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude. That's where a lot of our wage inflation is for particularly our technical employees.\nThere's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state, potentially. Again, we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. We are cognizant that things could change quickly, and we'll see and monitor, and that's how we set our forward guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Brian, I wanted to ask about AWS. Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. Maybe you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics.\nWhen you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in Q1 going to 29% in Q2, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward, just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure, Doug. I'll start with the second question. On margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned, it is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate in this business. It's always a factor of new investment in things like the sales force, new regions, and infrastructure capacity, offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see, pricing issues as we extend contracts. We've seen really good progress with our customer base, longer and longer commitments, really committing to the cloud. Some of that comes with credits to help them make their conversion to the cloud.\nThe revenue pattern can be, and the margin on that revenue can fluctuate quite a bit quarter to quarter. We see a lot of strength in the business right now. We're very happy with the growth rate. We're happy with the adoption of the cloud as you hit a potential rough patch in the economy. I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish. We started to draw lessons from that, but we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because, again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to face building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, the cloud computing really shows its value.\nWe're prepared, just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs and will help any who are scaling down. We'll also, again, continue to find new customers and new industries, including government agencies, and happy with that. If you look at, again, where our investment's been over the last few years in the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. Sorry, your other question was, is that it?\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust about current trends in terms of booking rates.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nGot it. I blended it into one answer. Yeah. Hopefully, that covered what you were asking about.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. Doug, just to pile onto that too, I mean, I think just the longer-term vision that Brian talked about here, we're right now with 84 availability zones. That's 26 geographic regions.\nWe've got plans to launch 24 more of those availability zones across eight regions. This is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and UAE, so a lot of different spots. I think continuing to focus on building out to customers, working on that pipeline, and building longer commitments, finding customers that are making longer commitments, is really important to that. Just to that point, I know the backlog figure that we've discussed in the past and disclosed on a quarterly basis in our filings, it's up 65% YoY, or about 13% QoQ. The weighted average remaining life of those long-term commitments that we're talking about here continues to grow, so it's at about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. Again, a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come.\nAs Brian talked about, we're working hard in many facets and investing in that to make sure we're in good position to serve folks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nThanks for taking the questions. Maybe two-parter on the advertising business where you saw continued strength. Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce, and how you think about the relative growth rates in advertising going forward between North America and international? The second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising.\nHow are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like connected TV and programmatic advertising where, from the outside in, it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment and increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nGreat. Hi, Eric. Thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America. Having said that, we are making great strides in international as well. We're also, as you mentioned, expanding our array of advertising products from our consumer websites to video opportunities, Twitch, and others. Dave, did you want to take the second part of that?\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. I think it was Eric, it was your question around kind of the interactive work.\nI mean, one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. We, of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music's ad-supported tier as well for audio ads, looking for opportunities like that where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content. I think there's a lot of good opportunity for that. What's great, video advertising, as you mentioned, is still early in that space. It's increasingly becoming mainstream, and I think viewing behaviors have really shifted away from some of the more traditional cable or kind of traditional viewing. Advertisers are using our ad-supported content to reach those viewers.\nThings that are ongoing, we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch, and then, of course, some things we're obviously excited about, Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nEric, I'll just add a little more on advertising because you're probably wondering again about potential for softness in that or macroeconomic factors. Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got to be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable.\nWhen people are looking, companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard, in addition to maybe longer-term things like brand building, and brings new selection to bear in front of customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Helfstein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Oppenheimer and Company\n\nThanks. If I can ask two. You called out just the 3P mix being at kind of highest level. Maybe talk about your focus to increase the mix to 3P and how that fits into plans for improved efficiency. Secondly, on international, how much of the weakness in the margins sequentially was FX-driven? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nLet me start on your first one. I challenged the premise a little bit there about incenting mix, or I believe that is how I interpreted your question.\nWe are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or first-party product from us. What we're all about, obviously, is price, selection, and convenience. 3P, it particularly helps us with selection. When it's part of FBA, it can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in one to two days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. We're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site. It's a great partnership, and it's worked really well. Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well, and advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base.\nIt's a very strong partnership, and it's been getting stronger. I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nJason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there, the report, there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income. There's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. Just looking broadly speaking at what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there in the investments, I think it's important to remember it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East.\nThere are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating in many of those cases considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the US. In our established international cases, UK, Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and establish stronger customer relationships, and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price, selection, and convenience, and working with vendors on commercial terms. In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion, and we expect to continue to do that given the strong competition across many of these markets.\nThat's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the US, but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign up for the Prime program, engage, and renew. We're also investing, depending on the regions, in kind of the local structure or infrastructure, for lack of a better term, whether it's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases, the internet and the telecom infrastructure. We're playing a role along with others. It's not just us investing in ways to create and enable that infrastructure to be successful.\nThose are some of the opportunities and challenges that, as you think about kind of where we are in the US versus international, are out there, the network complexities. Of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. We think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're learning, not just in what we've done in the history with the US, but also in many of these countries, and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nYoussef Squali\n\nHead Managing Director of the Internet & Digital Media Research Group, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you. I have two questions. One, can you discuss the impact, the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, etc., ahead on retention during the quarter?\nDo you feel that that's enough to offset the inflationary pressures we're seeing to date? On Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to all merchants using FBA to Amazon merchants, etc., and just kind of the broader implications on the business from that initiative? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you, Youssef. First, let's take them one at a time. On the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime member membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations, positively. I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. As I mentioned, in-stock's never been higher. Delivery speed is increasing.\nNot to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side, that'll be coming in the fall. We feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple of years of pandemic turmoil, and we think it's a good base to build upon. On the seller fee, again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs. You can see from our operating results, some of it's internal related, but a lot of it's external factors that we are not passing through at 100% to external groups. We've got to work our way out of the condition we're in.\nWe're making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year. Saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned, on the percentage mix. I think seller business remains strong and an integral part of our customer offering.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYoussef, this is Dave on your Buy with Prime question. Yeah. I mean, right now, it's allowing US-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. It's what they experience, they expect, and kind of come to expect with Amazon. That's the fast, free delivery, the seamless checkout, and the free returns on orders that are eligible. Right now, the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation only for merchants that are already using FBA.\nIt'll expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. We're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with, but also expanding. I think as you think about it, merchants obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. We have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools, capabilities, and, of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that. That's an opportunity for us to support merchants who may or may not be FBA sellers with the tools and the opportunity to sell their products online, scale their business, and build their brand.\nI'm really excited about, of course, getting to be able to launch this program over the last few months and dialing it up for more sellers as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nResearch Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you. Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount, which was by design after what happened last quarter. It won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. How do you think the environment is going to fare for you to be adding headcount? Also, the stock-based compensation came in below where you had guided for the Q2.\nIs this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for, or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is loosening up a little bit?\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThanks. Sure, Stephen. Thank you. On the headcount, yes. I think it was more, as we mentioned, last quarter. Last year, in Q1, we added, to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1. Prior year, we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000. We were pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant. Luckily, that variant subsided, and we were left with a higher headcount position.\nThat has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition, and was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. That is dominating the QoQ reduction in headcount. I would note that we're still up 188,000 YoY, and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. You're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday-level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce. I think we see good hiring rates. I think remember, there was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year, and it didn't arrive kind of quickly out of nowhere. We're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nStephen, on just your question on stock-based comp, as you mentioned, we do utilize restricted stock units or RSUs as our primary mode of equity compensation. As we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the Q2. As a result, we typically see a step up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2. Of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in line is impacted overall also in the step up by continued headcount. We've grown our workforce over the last few years. As Brian talked about, hiring in a number of areas of the business, including engineers, now they're tech workers, and there's some component of the wage inflation as we look to continue to hire and retain employees there.\nIn terms of the coming in at a little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver was primarily driven by fewer employee stock awards vesting. Excuse me. Fewer employee stock awards were vesting in Q2 than we expected. Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q1 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2022 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nThis guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining today's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is at the top end of our guidance range of $112 to 117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our Prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates.\nWe also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members, and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020, and we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees.\nLabor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets: externally driven costs, primarily inflation, and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Linehaul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices.\nFor example, the cost to ship an overseas container has more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates, and the cost of fuel is approximately one and a half times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs relate to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control, and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns, and greater stability in our operations.\nLet's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees out on leave, and we continued to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage.\nDespite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity, and we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operations capital expenditures for 2022, and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional cost year-over-year in Q1.\nWe do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control, and with demand normalizing, we remain focused on right-sizing our cost structure, and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year, and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion.\nDevelopers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to startups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefónica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the NHL, and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS's millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 Local Zones in the United States, with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local Zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry, and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments, so let me add to that with our current thinking.\nFirst, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31st 2022. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. Think of that as the middle and last-mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space, and physical stores. For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part to support the rapid growth and innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022.\nFor the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into, and we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust mid-year. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion, included in non-operating expense, from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive.\nYou may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth through roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries, and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate.\nLastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we pull for your questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks. I want to ask two questions, please. In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. If you look sequentially, if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical? Briefly on the margins for Q2, you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nHi, Mark. How are you doing? On revenue, yes. The revenue guidance we've given is kind of our best view of what we're seeing right now. Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment, levels of usage benefits being used, etc. A big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of a very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, then we moved Prime Day to Q3. We're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer or, excuse me, the household budgets. A lot of times, that is a time when people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices, selection, and convenience.\nIt can go one of two ways, but we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side, though.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nMark, I think your second question was related to the operating income guidance and some of the detail there. Brian said it's the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter, but he detailed a number of pieces. Like you said, expect to see in aggregate about $4 billion of pressure for the three buckets that Brian talked about: higher inflationary pressures, lower productivity, and some fixed cost to leverage persisting into Q2. That will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit, and working to lever our fixed costs. Specifically, we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about.\nThe other thing, again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of his open, to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. Recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion, which is up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Big picture, Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat, and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through, and when can we start to see that? Second question, it looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat. Probably makes sense with the input costs, but we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Are you seeing savings there, and how do you think about shipping costs versus units? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic, essentially from our world, from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. We started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. We saw noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year. On units, though, units grew during that. Instead of jumping to 40%, they jumped to the mid-40% to 50 range, mainly because of the product mix. People were buying a lot more gloves, cleaning agents, and all the things tied to the pandemic.\nThere was a lot of you have to look at the unit data with keeping that in mind because there's a heavy mix issue. Putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. It's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. We're really glad that we have our—we built our AMZL network. We would not be able to have a one-day program, same-day and one-day shipments if we tried to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost-effective.\nWhat you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but it's essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nJustin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in Ukraine since our last quarter. We see larger impacts of inflation from line haul, shipping rates, fuel, shipping supplies, and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. We also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers. Now, when you look at costs for customers and sellers, in terms of product pricing, I just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low, competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers.\nFor our one-piece business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to reputable competitors out there, and staying really close to that on the data. For third-party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. They're running their own businesses and will adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well. Of course, on pricing and many other services with sellers, we offer services to help them not only handle with logistics, but also get better pricing information to make sure that they're staying on top of that as well. Wherever we can help them, we do that. We did increase some fees effective, I believe it's today, related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there.\nWe're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by other sellers, but it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down, and for how long they'll persist. Rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. It's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Brian, I want to ask you about one-day, same-day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection, in some cases back to where it was pre-pandemic, what are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for one-day, same-day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data? The second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling and tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year? Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. Let me start with your first question. On one-day and same-day, yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. This doesn't turn on a dime. I think, as a consumer, I notice it myself. I see more things in stock, and it opens up a consideration set for things that I may have had to run to the store to get in a short period of time. That trust, as you see more and more of that, you trust it, and you continue to order, and you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, that's going to be my first stop before I even think about going to the store. It has to be built over time. It doesn't take years.\nIt takes hopefully weeks and months, but we're hopeful and expectant that that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticities that we started to see pre-pandemic.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nOn the second point, the technology and content, just as a reminder, the components in there is you've got the Amazon tech and the AWS infrastructure. Everything from servers, network, and equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent, and utilities, those types of things, the AWS tech employee costs, and costs to support the dot-com website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on. For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset, Q1 2022, related to a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter.\nIn terms of just the investment areas, I just reinforce it's continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. Then just broadly speaking, inclusive AWS, the headcount to support the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing, as well as some consumer tech teams, the Alexa and Echo devices, and certain other areas there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for the question. You talked about how you're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, and in fact, you're actually running out of excess at the moment. Should you could talk a little bit about how long you think it could take to regain some of the productivity and cost efficiencies in the fulfillment network. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure thing. Well, let me start with productivity. We began and ended the quarter with essentially a billion or, excuse me, a million-six employees, 1.6 million employees, most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter. We have certain ability with contractors and all to adjust headcount. For the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges, or permanent Amazon employees. Now we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right capacity, and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation level. That's what we're working on.\nWe've made good strides in the last month, and we see a line of sight to getting back not all the way to pre-pandemic rates in the next quarter or two, but a good bit of the way. That's what we're firmly focused on and working on. That's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second to that question? Okay. Go ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. I hope you're both well. Maybe I could just stick on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of 2022 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint, where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? Is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus things we already knew before.\nMaybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently, when you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide, but there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build, employee build, and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years? Just so we can keep that front of mind. Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nSure thing. Good questions, Eric. Let me start with the cost penalties. In Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. A billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. We indicated that that would be carrying over into 2022, and it has. From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. We did not have as much labor, even though we added, I believe it was 200—I have it right here—270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor, and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long-zone shipments, half-full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor.\nWe made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'd be able to hold our labor for Q1, and labor certainty would be a lot better and start taming our network. That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. Our reaction to it was that, again, an uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were on leave, we hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in the warehouses. The issue has switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor, and we believe that that will dissipate. It'll take time in Q2, so it's not the full—we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that.\nInflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. It's more a factor of that those costs will now, we believe, persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. I mentioned some of the per-unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments, and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things like transportation and fuel. We're working on that. As we progress, there's only guidance for Q2, but what we see is that the fixed cost, the leverage will narrow as we go through the year.\nWe'll be really glad we have some capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both inventory and orders, and then definitely in the holiday season. We see it as we've come out of a very tumultuous two years. We're glad we made the decisions we made over the past two years, and now we have a chance to have a more right-sized capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. What's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on, evaluating, and finding ways to mitigate, and in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. We will see.\nWe expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May 2020 to May 2021. It's not like the volume has receded. In Q1, literally, revenue is 61% higher over two years from 2020. The way to think about it is it went up and stayed up, and now it'll resume a more normal growth pattern. I wouldn't be fooled by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. The letter mentioned some impacts post the Ukraine invasion. I'm guessing it's mostly on the inflation and the fuel costs you just mentioned. Any comment about how revenue trajectory compared in March after the conflict started versus before across your geographies? Was there any noticeable difference between Prime member volume and non-Prime? Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. Hi, Ross. No, I would say there's not a lot of Prime versus non-Prime differential. We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. From kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong. There's no indicators that we're seeing of weakness in consumer demand. We're wary of it, as probably all companies are, because household budgets are tightened when fuel costs are doubling, and a big part of your ripples through food. It ripples through everything else. We're cognizant of that. What we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better, and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period, and making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Helfstein\n\nManaging Director and Head of Internet Research, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Two questions. Can you talk about advertising a bit? Are you seeing supply chain disruption having any impact on advertising? Any comment there? Second, I do not think AWS backlog was asked if there are any numbers you can share on AWS backlog growth this quarter versus last quarter. Thanks.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. Jason, I'll take the second one first, just on the backlog. Yeah, I mean, we're continuing to see what the backlog is, right, is the increase of AWS customers making long-term commitments for AWS. At the March period ended, we had an $88.9 billion balance for that. That's up about 68% year-over-year, and the weighted average remaining kind of lifetime for those is 3.8 years.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nCFO, Amazon\n\nOn revenue—excuse me—advertising revenue was up 25% year-over-year, and that's a strong run rate compared to the revenue growth rate. We're still very happy and pleased with the way the advertising team is performing and how advertising has been valued by both sellers, vendors, and others who use it to reach our customer base at the point where they're considering purchases. A strong quarter and continued rollout of new and new products for sellers to manage their advertising and increase the ability to analyze and calculate the payback on marketing investments with us.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nJoining us today on the call and for your questions, a replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interst, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2021 financial results teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q4 2021 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, 3 February 2022 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.\nThis guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nThank you for joining us today. Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job at delivering for customers this holiday. Now, let's discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies.\nOur third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we've seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year over year than any quarter in its history and is now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate one year ago. Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year over year. As I've mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multi-year compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective.\nDespite lapping 2020's extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon's two-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We've invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past two years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint, while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast, on-time delivery. There are now 1.6 million Amazon employees worldwide, also doubling in the two-year period. Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures, and lost productivity and disruption in our operations.\nThe inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations, as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Lost productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021, and, more recently, by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter. Our results also include approximately $1 billion year over year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021, and our fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time.\nNow, with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong, and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses, and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continued to look to AWS for critical, innovative cloud solutions. Now, at $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year over year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our 10th Reinvent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees, and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually.\nReinvent remains a highlight of the year for us because it's a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event, as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. In the past quarter alone, Nasdaq announced a multi-year partnership to migrate its North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, selected AWS as its long-term strategic cloud provider to accelerate artificial intelligence research and development.\nStellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, and RAM, selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill its global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world's largest companies, such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian, and more, are using AWS to transform their businesses. Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November. Before we move to Q&A, there are three additional items I'll mention related to our disclosures.\nFirst, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenue as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We're excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video, and measurement. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for Amazon customers, and when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we're prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations.\nWe are increasing the useful life for servers from four years to five years, and network equipment from five years to six years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we're calling out and counting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life both for the assets that we use to support AWS's external customers, as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses.\nWe will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1. We continue to make Prime better. In recent years, we've added more product selection available with fast, free, unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts, and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music, and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. In this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of a historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018, in the US, availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%, and members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime Days.\nThis is all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast, free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy, and the continually growing Amazon Music catalog for Prime members, as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we've seen, as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States, with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99, and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on 18 February 2022. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after 25 March 2022 on the date of their next renewal. With that, let's move on to Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will open up for questions. We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your keypad. We ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone telephone at this time. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery, and how that sets the company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you're seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last-mile delivery competitors? Thanks so much.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nHi, Eric. Sure thing. On same-day, again, there's multiple levels of fast shipping here, from ultra-fast, which is essentially our grocery business, in one to two hours, to same-day and less, and then one-day and two-day Prime. We feel good about where we are. We're continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for one-day delivery and improving upon that, and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We're doing that globally as well, but we really think that combination of speed for different product lines, excuse me, really resonates with customers.\nThere's a lot of new offers for, excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis, but we know how hard this is, and our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and have our cost structure commensurate with that. That's where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we've made developing our Amazon logistics capability over the last few years. We've been adding, as we've mentioned, we've doubled the capacity in the network over the last two years. That is not all just to handle today's volume. It's also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. We like where we stand. We know there's work to do on improving our customer service.\nWe like the progress we've been making lately, but we think the future is bright on that dimension.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. Ryan, the first one, there's a lot that's changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic, more same-day, more grocery, more last-mile investments in an ad business. I'm curious to hear, as you sort of think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow of retail fallen at all post-pandemic because of the higher required investments? Is it the first one? The second one, like the new disclosure, be curious for any other disclosure about the number of engineers or the size of the teams you have working on, a lot of the innovation that you talked about that are sort of more around early-stage, non-revenue-generating projects so we can better understand that investment in Amazon. Thanks.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nSure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They all generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we've separated out advertising. I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally, but a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we'll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. You asked about the business model. I think it's a good question. As we reflect over the last two years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You check them off there: the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery, and how valuable that's become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud.\nThe ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon logistics, sets us up well for the future. We've been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period. The early wave of disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it, and then quickly playing catch-up. As that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we've really had to scramble to add workers. We've been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. If you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. There's a lot of expansion that's been going on in the network, and we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability.\nIf you step back, there's procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There are fees in some cases for 3P services, and Prime, as we just mentioned, is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. Again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. We're really working hard to do that, and that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection, and more convenience. If you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas. It's really the onus on us to get our operational efficiency back in all of our areas of cost. We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We've hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still—our teams are all battling Omicron right now.\nWe do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that's going to be where we're going to put a lot of our effort.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the question. Brian, you doubled your fulfillment network and also your headcount over the past two years. I believe you're about two and a half years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle? Can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year?\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nYeah. Let's talk a little bit about capital expenditures, and I'm going to do this with inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We're doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. When you look at those numbers and how they've grown over the last few years, I'll give you the proportions, which I'm not sure we've initially shown before. It's about 40%, just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS, but also certainly Amazon is a large customer of that as well, as we build infrastructure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses, warehouse only, not transportation. Then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally.\nThe remaining 5% or so is small things like offices, stores, and other capital areas. Those are the three main areas. If I look to the future, we're still working through some of our plans for 2022, but it's coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business that's growing globally, and we're adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. We feel good about making those investments. On the fulfillment center side, that's about 30% of the spend in the last two years. We see that moderating, and that will probably now match growth of our underlying businesses.\nI think there's always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of Qube that may not be different than the square footage. We want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels Prime in one-day delivery, two-day delivery, and same-day delivery. That's very important, but we see the FCPs likely moderating this year. The third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022. If you wrap that up, we expect CapEx, including equipment finance leases, to increase year over year. I can't give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on how we approach it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks. You'd lay out all of these costs that you were expecting to see in the December quarter. Just talk to me whether there were any real surprises to you. It looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. Use that to help us think about what the—I think you said the sun's coming out. Financially, does that mean that we're going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year, as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? Just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion, and how we should think about those playing out as we go forward. Thanks a lot.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nOkay, Mark. Just remember that I'm sitting in Seattle, so my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. No, we do see things improving. Let's step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies that cause, as well as increased labor rates, shift differentials of premiums, and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better. We could have had more people, so we had to cover a lot of—there was additional overtime. There were some higher costs on third-party transportation. All in all, the challenge in Q4 was to increase the staffing.\nWe said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net net about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year. As you turn the page into 2022, we feel better about labor, except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there's a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short-term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. There are instances where you're paying twice or three times for the same labor hour. If someone is on leave, you're paying them, and you're also paying potentially for someone who's covering the shift on overtime. There's cost pressure in Q1.\nI think the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4, Q3, and Q4. We're hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up, and we're going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. There are a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over two years now. They need—we got a great team, and we have confidence that things will improve as we get through the year. Hopefully, that answers your question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nThanks. Hey, Brian and Dave. Wanted to ask about AWS and nice acceleration in revenues there. Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the drivers of that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you're seeing that contribute incrementally to growth? I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that. Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nSure, Colin. Thanks for your questions. On the growth rate, I think it's a combination of things. We've been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we're lapping as different companies had different COVID experience. Some of their volumes went through the roof, some of their volumes went through the floor. As things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that, and probably accelerated their internal timelines for that. We're there to help, and we're working very hard to make that journey a successful one. We have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help, as well as technical advisors.\nThat is what we're seeing, and we're pleased with the acceleration of the business the last four quarters. We're also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned. The expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it's actually—we're seeing it in real life. Very positive indicators in AWS.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nHey, Colin. It's Dave here, just following up on the international point. What we're seeing outside of the US, I mean, as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum, really around the world. It's customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. As you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there's a good, diverse list of companies. Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environment to AWS, and then other ones, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There's a number of really great companies, examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration. What's been important to us, amongst many things, is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint, really to support this momentum we're seeing. Just this last quarter, in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia-Pacific region over in Jakarta.\nWe've got announcements for plans to launch in Canada and the Calgary region next year, or perhaps, I think it's 2023 or 2024. A lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples. Where we sit now, AWS has 84 availability zones in 26 regions around the world right now. In terms of the forward-looking roadmap, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in eight more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jason Helstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Helfstein\n\nHead of Internet Research, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. I just want to dig a little bit into third-party seller services. The growth slowed there even on a two-year stack. Maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that. Just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you're still seeing? I mean, you talked about why this was a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to growth, either supply chain or employee-related? Thank you.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nSorry, Jason, is your second question on AWS?\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, on AWS.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nOkay. Thank you. Let me start with that. Yeah, sorry. Let me start with that. We don't see bottlenecks on the capacity side. Probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their timelines. We're investing and working hard to do that. Operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned on the capital section, capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year over year in 2022. On 3P, I think what you're seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business. As I mentioned earlier, we're dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 2020 through Q1 2021. On a two-year basis, you're still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P seller services revenue. Granted, that was 34% last quarter, but it's maintaining.\nI think the bigger point is that sellers were definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to help sellers be successful on our site. They're a big consumer of advertising as well, because they use it to build their brands and enable customers to see their selection and make purchases. We are very happy with the third-party seller services business and, again, looking for ways to help sellers be successful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Post\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Maybe we'll talk about advertising services. Maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven't already. How much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration? Bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that? Thank you.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nYeah. Let me start with why we broke it out. We have looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. We got to a point where, as you've been pretty much mentioning every quarter, the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. We felt at a certain size that we should break it out and then split the other off of that. That was really the impetus for the change. We look at those things every year, and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. Hopefully, that's helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter of 33% is down from 66% in Q4 of last year.\nQ4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for the first time. Prime Day carries a lot. I can't scale it for you, but there's a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously. When that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day, and it was lapping Q2 of 2021. It was lapping the 2020 period that didn't have a Prime Day in it. That'll move around a bit, but I think the bigger story here is the success we're having with sellers and vendors, and making that a useful product for customers.\nJustin, just to add to that, I mean, the priorities with advertising are at a high level, it's improved the tool usability.\nWe think there's great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, to keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences. Again, the more we can interact with the advertisers, the customers, and learn and have more opportunities to hear from them and understand that we can build better analytic tools, provide better measurement, give them better insight into performance. Really focused on serving brands. It's in the sponsored ad space, but we've talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity. As we've got properties like Fire TV, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in live sports, and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the US, but overseas in a number of properties. Really excited to kind of work with folks.\nThis is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they're making their purchase decisions, giving them information around that. That, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. I think that's one area that we're excited about. I think in a longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon's DSP is something that we're continuing to work on and refine and, again, focus on the customer, as we always do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Blackledge\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Two questions. First, could you discuss how the supply chain affected the business in Q4 and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in Q1 2022 and for the year? The second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-US markets? Thank you.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nHi, John. Thank you for your questions. First, on Prime question, we evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply that, the usage, and the value that we're creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018, that the time was right to raise it. We think it's a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. Other countries will continue to evaluate every year, and nothing else to announce right now. On supply chain, there are specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we're waiting for products. As far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bought a product ahead.\nWe worked with vendors to secure inventory early, in some cases paid early, which had a working capital impact. We also worked very hard to open up channels of existing input into the country, whether it was port capacity or vessel capacity. We did everything we knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. We think it worked for our customers in Q4. As challenges remain in 2020, I wouldn't say we've totally passed that, but we don't expect it to be a big issue in Q1.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDan Salmon\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood afternoon. Good evening, guys. Thanks for sitting me in. First, I just wanted to follow up a little bit and see on the advertising numbers if there's any qualitative color that you could add, say, rough balance of performance advertising versus brand advertising, maybe US versus the rest of the world. Anything you add could be great. Then just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football as one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime. Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important? Is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage?\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nSure. Let me start with that second question. I didn't want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because of Thursday Night Football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we've been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable, as well as international sports. We had one of the highest-rated games in Q4 with, I believe, it was Manchester United, and I'm going to mix up the team. Sorry.\nPersonal? I don't know.\nYeah, I won't embarrass myself. Again, we've been working on getting sports properties that will be beneficial and valuable to Prime offering. We're still probably early on in that. We've had, obviously, success with Premier League soccer, other soccer leagues around the world, tennis properties, and also probably the marquee is the work with the NFL and Thursday Night Football.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nDan, in terms of just a breakout, I think, as we've said before, on the advertising side, the sponsored products and brands, they make up the majority of the ad revenue today. We haven't given a split on a geographic basis, but suffice to say, a lot of these efforts, as Brian talked about, whether it's on the video advertising opportunities or in those sponsored products and sponsored brands efforts, we've replicated a lot of the tools, features, and services around the world and are kind of constantly learning and building out the brand and the presence with that, so we can make better inroads with customers over the long term.\n\nBrian Olsavsky\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Amazon\n\nBecause I don't want to leave you hanging, Dan, the Manchester United and Arsenal soccer game in December was the most watched Premier League match ever on our service, with an estimated viewership of 4 million. I think that is actually pretty interesting because we've had a lot of increasingly good relationship with the Premier League. We've had Boxing Day games, and we continue to be a valuable partner for each other.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Amazon\n\nWith that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.",

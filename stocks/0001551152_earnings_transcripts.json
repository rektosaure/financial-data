Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie's business continues to perform above our expectations. We delivered another excellent quarter, including strong financial results, pipeline advancement across all stages of development and strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth. Given our positive momentum, we are raising our 2025 outlook for the third time this year.\nStarting with our third quarter performance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion, reflecting high single-digit sales growth and beating our expectations by approximately $300 million. I'm especially pleased with the execution of our growth platform, including combined sales growth of more than 40% from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, our leading immunology medicines as well as double-digit revenue growth from Neuroscience, our second largest and fastest-growing therapeutic area. With no significant LOE event in the near term, our growth platform provides a clear line of sight to growth into the next decade. This puts AbbVie in a strong position to fully invest for the 2030s and beyond.\nSince our inception in 2013, we have invested more than $84 billion to research, discover and develop new medicines and solutions for patients. We anticipate $9 billion of adjusted R&D expense in 2025, a substantial increase from the prior year. This supports numerous pipeline opportunities across our core areas, immunology, oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics as well as new sources of growth like obesity. More broadly, I'm very pleased with the breadth and depth of our robust pipeline with approximately 90 programs across all stages of development. We are making excellent progress and expect several important milestones over the next 2 years, including new product approvals for Tavapadon and [ PVC ], expanded indications for Rinvoq, [ Kinley ] , Qulipta and Ubrelvy and pivotal data for lutikizumab, [ MAPA ] and [ etentimag ]. These pipeline programs have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie later this decade.\nWe also continue to invest in external innovation adding novel mechanisms and platform technologies to further augment our pipeline to drive growth in the 2030s and beyond. Our recent deal activity includes announcing the acquisition of Gilgamesh's [ bretisilicin ], expanding our psychiatry pipeline with a next-generation psychodelic currently in Phase II development for NDD and closing the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics, further strengthening our immunology pipeline with an in vivo CAR-T platform. Our consistently strong performance as well as the progress we are making to build and advance a robust pipeline fully supports our capital allocation priorities. This includes investing at least $10 billion of capital in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Construction is already underway for a new API manufacturing site in North Chicago as well as expansion of biologics manufacturing and R&D capacity at our existing site in [ Worcester ]. We are also committed to delivering a healthy sustainable dividend that grows every year.\nToday, we announced a 5.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 330%. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio, and our long-term outlook remains very strong.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.9 billion, up 11.2% on an operational basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continued to exceed our expectations, once again demonstrating robust growth across a broad set of indications. Skyrizi global sales were $4.7 billion, reflecting operational growth of 46%. Rinvoq global revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 34.1% on an operational basis.\nI'm especially pleased with our portfolio performance in gastroenterology, where these 2 medicines are on pace to nearly double their combined sales in IBD this year. Our uptake in Crohn's disease remains impressive with Skyrizi and Rinvoq together achieving in-play share leadership in a dozen countries. This includes capturing roughly 50% of newer switching Crohn's patients across all lines of therapy in the U.S. We see similar momentum in ulcerative colitis as well with Skyrizi and Rinvoq collectively holding in-play share leadership in more than 10 key markets and capturing nearly 1 out of every 3 newer switching UC patients across all mechanisms in the U.S.\nIBD continues to be an area of high unmet need with substantial headroom for biologic penetration as well as expanding lines of therapy. Given the compelling efficacy, safety and dosing profiles for both assets, Skyrizi with less frequent dosing favored by patients and clinicians especially for the maintenance treatment relative to the most effective dose for other IL-23s. In Rinvoq, often preferred for difficult-to-treat IBD cases, having demonstrated the strongest response rates in UC studies, as well as very strong efficacy in CD as well.\nAlong with Rinvoq's recently expanded label in IBD, which is a great outcome for patients who will now have access to Rinvoq earlier in the treatment paradigm when anti-TNF treatment is clinically inadvisable. So we remain very competitively positioned for continued strong growth across gastroenterology.\nMoving to the rest of our core immunology indications. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well in psoriasis, gaining share across our key markets. This includes an impressive 50% in-play patient share for biologics in the U.S. Rinvoq is also delivering strong prescription growth in rheumatology. In RA, Rinvoq continues to achieve the leading in-play patient share across lines of therapy. We now have 3 head-to-head studies demonstrating Rinvoq's superiority to other biologics in RA, including recent positive data from our [ Select ] switch trial, which clearly supports the clinical benefits of switching to Rinvoq after a first TNF failure. Lastly, we are seeing a very nice ramp in GCA, where Rinvoq now has full formulary coverage. I'm very pleased with the progress and look forward to the commercialization of additional sizable indications like alopecia areata and vitiligo.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $993 million, down 55.7% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We continue to anticipate HUMIRA access in the U.S. will decrease throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026 as more plans select exclusionary contracts for existing patients. This step-up in volume erosion is expected to be partially offset by a price benefit also associated with these contract changes, which is included in our fourth quarter outlook.\nMoving to oncology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion, relatively flat versus prior year. Momentum from Venclexta as well as newer products, ELAHERE at [ Kinley ] and EMRELIS helped to offset the expected sales decline from IMBRUVICA, which continues to be impacted by competitive dynamics in CLL. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making to expand our commercial capabilities in both heme and solid tumors with our existing portfolio. These efforts will ultimately support our emerging oncology pipeline, which includes several promising programs to improve patient outcomes in many difficult-to-treat cancers.\nTurning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of approximately $1.2 billion, down 4.2% on an operational basis. BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $637 million and JUVEDERM global sales were $253 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. While our portfolio is performing well from a competitive perspective, we continue to face challenging market conditions in several key markets, which are impacting our results. With overall consumer sentiment remained quite low, especially in the U.S. as concerns about the economy and inflation way on discretionary spending, we now see category growth tracking below our previous assumptions globally.\nHowever, this near-term macro pressure does not dampen our excitement for the long-term potential of our leading aesthetics portfolio. We are investing to support patient activation with robust promotion and product innovation. We recently launched new consumer campaigns for Botox as well as fillers to further stimulate category growth, which remains highly underpenetrated and where we stand to disproportionately benefit upon market recovery giving our leading product shares. Innovation from our pipeline, including novel toxins like TrenibotE, a fast-acting short-duration toxin as well as several next-generation fillers will also provide growth in the coming years.\nMoving now to neuroscience, which is demonstrating exceptional performance. Total revenues were more than $2.8 billion, up 19.6% on an operational basis. I'm very pleased with our leading migraine portfolio with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and BOTOX Therapeutic, all delivering robust double-digit growth. Qulipta is now the #1 CGRP treatment for migraine prevention with a total prescription share of approximately 7.5%. Vraylar is also performing well in both bipolar and [ AMDD ] with total sales of $934 million, up 6.7%. Physicians continue to report positive feedback on Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, including dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to address anhedonia and anxiety symptoms often associated with depression.\nLastly, in Parkinson's disease, Vyalev's launch trajectory has been very impressive. Total sales were $138 million, up 40% on a sequential basis. The uptake across international markets continues to exceed our expectations with physicians and patient communities highlighting meaningful improvements in on-time and off time from the 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms throughout the morning, day and night. Vyalev is the only Parkinson's treatment that often replaces the need for add-on oral therapies to manage motor fluctuations, reducing the daily pill burden for these patients. We anticipate expanded coverage of Vyalev in the U.S. soon, which we expect will provide further revenue inflection next year.\nI'm also excited about Tavapadon where we are pursuing approval for use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. This will be a very complementary offering for both [ BioLife ] and Duodopa. Given the significant commercial opportunity with our emerging Parkinson's portfolio, we are now actively expanding our field sales team to support higher anticipated demand next year. Overall, again, we are demonstrating strong revenue growth and our commercial execution has been outstanding.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights. Roopal?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP of Development & Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer\n\nThank you, Jeff. Starting with Immunology. We announced positive top line results from the second Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial, reinforcing the potential for Rinvoq to significantly improve hair regrowth for patients suffering from severe forms of this condition. Data were consistent with the results from the first trial with Rinvoq demonstrating meaningful improvement in hair regrowth across both doses compared to placebo. We remain on track to begin submitting regulatory applications later this year. We also recently announced positive top line results from 2 Phase III Rinvoq vitiligo trials. In both studies, Rinvoq met the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 48, demonstrating improvements in both total body and facial vitiligo scoring compared to placebo.\nWe are very pleased with these results, which illustrate Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo. The daily challenges of living with this condition can often lead to depression and anxiety. With no approved systemic treatment, there is very high unmet need for these patients. Once approved, Rinvoq could potentially be the first systemic therapy available for vitiligo. Regulatory submissions are planned for early next year.\nPositive top line results were also announced from the [ SELECT SWITCH ] trial, which compared Rinvoq to HUMIRA in RA patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to their first TNF inhibitor. This is the first head-to-head study comparing anti-TNF cycling versus switching to Rinvoq. In this study, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority in HUMIRA for efficacy measures with nearly twice as many patients achieving low disease activity and remission, for RA patients who did not respond well to their first TNF inhibitor, these results clearly show the benefit of switching to Rinvoq rather than cycling to another anti-TNF.\nIn IBD, Rinvoq recently received a label update in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, allowing its use prior to anti-TNFs in patients who have received at least one approved systemic therapy when TNF inhibitors are clinically inadvisable. The treatment paradigm has evolved in IBD with increasing utilization of newer higher efficacy agents like Skyrizi. There are certain clinical scenarios when and anti-TNF may not be the most appropriate next treatment option for a patient. This label update provides physicians with the flexibility to use Rinvoq prior to anti-TNFs for certain patients after they have tried another approved systemic therapy.\nMoving to Oncology. The regulatory application was submitted to the FDA for [ PIVC ] in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. This rare aggressive blood cancer primarily affects an older population who is at high risk for complications with traditional chemotherapy or precluded from stem cell transplantation. As a new treatment providing durable responses with a manageable safety profile, our novel ADC has the potential to become an important new therapeutic option for these patients. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented 3 orals for Temab-A, highlighting this novel ADCs potential, both as a monotherapy and in combination across advanced difficult-to-treat solid tumors.\nIn CRC patients who received 2 or more prior lines of therapy, and regardless of c-MET expression levels, Temab-A, in combination with [ bevacizumab ], demonstrated manageable safety and better responses and disease control compared to current standard of care. Treatment with Temab-A at 2.4 milligrams per kilogram plus [ bevacizumab ] achieved an objective response rate of 30% and a confirmed disease control rate of 97% compared to rates of 0% and 70%, respectively, for [ LONSURF ] plus [ bevacizumab ]. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III study for this combination in late line all-comers CRC.\nIn a proof-of-concept study in pancreatic cancer, monotherapy Temab-A demonstrated an objective response rate of 24% in the overall population and 40% in patients who received first-line [ gemcitabine ] plus [ Abraxane ]. A Phase II study in pancreatic cancer is expected to begin next year. And in an exploratory study in MET amplified solid tumors after progression following standard of care monotherapy with Temab-A resulted in an objective response rate of 47% and median duration of response of 12.5 months for the 2.4 milligram per kilogram dose. Higher responses were observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a rate of 69% in gastroesophageal cancer with a rate of 71%. A Phase II study in MET amplified solid tumors is expected to begin later this year. We are making significant progress with Temab-A across a broad range of tumors, and there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating durable efficacy and a manageable safety profile in these difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to providing additional updates on Temab-A programs as data mature.\nIn Neuroscience, the regulatory application for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease was recently submitted to the FDA. For many patients with Parkinson's, existing oral therapies aren't sufficient to manage symptoms. Our selective D1/D5 receptor partial agonist demonstrated robust efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as an adjunct to [ levocarbidopa ] oral therapy in patients still experiencing motor fluctuations. Once approved, we believe Tavapadon will be an important new treatment option.\nResults from a Phase II study evaluating BOTOX an upper limb essential tremor were recently presented at the MDS Congress. In the study, BOTOX met the primary in all secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvements in all assessment measures compared to placebo. With a global patient population of about 25 million, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. This progressive neurological condition can substantially hinder patients' physical activities and diminish their quality of life. Current treatment options are limited in terms of both efficacy and tolerability, leaving considerable need for new therapies.\nBased on these results, we plan to advance a new toxin for upper limb essential tremor. [ Jemmy bode ] is a novel toxin that has demonstrated different pharmacologic properties preclinically compared to BOTOX, such as less diffusion to neighboring muscles. Phase II studies for [ Jemmy bode ] in essential tremor and potential hernia repair will begin next year.\nTo further expand our neuropsychiatry pipeline, we acquired -- we acquired [ Bretasilisen ] from [ Gilgamesh ]. [ Bretasilisen ] is a novel [ 5-HT2A ] receptor agonist and 5-HT releaser with a short duration of hallucination that has demonstrated robust efficacy in a Phase II proof-of-concept study in major depressive disorder. Rapid efficacy was achieved after the initial dose with response and remission maintained through day 74 without additional intervention. This novel psycodelic has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients by offering rapid robust and durable antidepressant effects following a short in-clinic treatment session. Additional Phase II studies in depression are expected to begin next year.\nTo summarize, we continue to make good progress across all stages in therapeutic areas of our pipeline and look forward to many important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2026.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our third quarter results. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $1.50 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense primarily reflecting upfront charges for the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics and our license agreement with IGI. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion reflecting growth of 8.4% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nImportantly, our ex-HUMIRA growth platform delivered reported sales growth of more than 20%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 14.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 30.9% of sales, which includes a 17% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $667 million, the adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, reflecting the lower deductibility of acquired IPR&D expense this quarter.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.61 and $10.65. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $60.9 billion, an increase of $400 million. This updated forecast primarily reflects Skyrizi global sales of $17.3 billion, an increase of $200 million with continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD. Neuroscience global revenues of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting continued strength across Vraylar, BOTOX Therapeutic, Vyalev and the total oral CGRP portfolio. Aesthetics total sales of $4.9 billion, a decrease of $200 million reflecting greater-than-expected market softness globally. With the remaining $200 million increase reflecting the collective momentum from Rinvoq and several other products across our diverse portfolio. And we also continue to assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nMoving to the P&L for full year 2025. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of $9 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $13.5 billion. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 41% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the roughly 6% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the third quarter. And we now forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.3%, also reflecting the impact of acquired IPR&D.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of more than $16.3 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.36. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was more than $5.6 billion and we generated approximately $13 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $2.2 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.5% to $1.73 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. As well as capacity for continued business development, we have executed approximately 30 deals since the beginning of 2024, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. We also remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. In closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Cedric, we'll take the first question, please.",

Welcome to AbbVie's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie delivered another outstanding quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We are making excellent progress advancing our pipeline and adding more depth through strategic transactions that support our long-term growth.\nTurning to our second quarter performance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, more than $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement includes sales growth of 22% from our ex-Humira platform with continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are now on pace to deliver more than $25 billion in combined sales this year, well above our initial expectations. We also delivered strong double-digit growth from neuroscience, driven by Vraylar, Vyalev and our leading migraine portfolio.\nBased on our momentum through the first half of the year, we are raising guidance for the second time. We now expect full year revenue of $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. We have now raised our revenue guidance by $1.5 billion since the start of the year. We are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.21, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.88 and $12.08.\nIn addition to our strong financial results, we are making great progress with our R&D pipeline across all stages of development. Notable highlights from our late-stage programs include the recent approvals of [indiscernible] for nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer and Rinvoq for GCA. The regulatory submission of [ Trenibot-E ] a first-in-class short-acting toxin in aesthetics as well as highly differentiated Phase III results in alopecia areata, a potential 10th indication for Rinvoq in the U.S. We are also focused on augmenting our pipeline with therapies and platform technologies that have the potential to elevate the standard of care for patients. These include promising early stage programs that have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie in the next decade.\nWe have executed more than 30 business development transactions since the beginning of last year.\nOur recent activity includes closing the agreement with Gubra for a long-acting amylin analog in the treatment of obesity as well as announcing our planned acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics, giving us an in vivo CAR-T platform that can further strengthen our immunology pipeline. We also in-licensed ISB-2001, a novel trispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, and we announced the collaboration with ADARx to develop next-generation siRNA therapies across multiple disease areas, including immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with the performance of our business and the progress we are making against our long-term strategy. AbbVie's outlook is strong, and we are well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7.6 billion. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate impressive growth. Global sales were $4.4 billion, up 61.8% on an operational basis. We continue to capture robust in-play patient share in psoriatic disease. In the U.S., this includes clear leadership in psoriasis across all lines of therapy versus both biologics and oral agent as well as continued strong performance in the PSA derm setting with frontline in-play share leadership more than double the next closest biological oral therapy. Globally, Skyrizi continues to grow and achieve total psoriatic disease market leadership in numerous major markets around the world.\nI'm also very pleased with Skyrizi's performance in IBD, where we are on track to double our sales this year. In the U.S., we continue to capture more than 1/3 of newer switching patients in Crohn's disease and nearly 20% of newer switching patients in ulcerative colitis. As we look ahead, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's profile, including compelling efficacy, safety and dosing and our very robust head-to-head program where we have demonstrated superiority and clear differentiation against multiple novel therapies sets a high bar for comparison. So as we do compare our current dynamic share to total prescription share, it's clear there is still a substantial opportunity for continued total share gain across all of Skyrizi's indications over time, especially in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are still earlier in their launch trajectory.\nTurning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating outstanding growth. Global sales were $2 billion, up 41.2% on an operational basis as we continue to see nice momentum across all of Rinvoq's indications. Uptake in IBD continues to be very strong. In the U.S., Rinvoq's in-play patient share across all lines of therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is second only to Skyrizi among branded medicines. So our portfolio, Rinvoq and Skyrizi together are capturing 1 out of every 2 in-play Crohn's disease patients and 1 out of every 3 in-play UC patients in the U.S. a very strong combined leadership position in gastroenterology for AbbVie.\nI'd also highlight that we are making excellent progress with Rinvoq's global launch in giant cell arteritis, our sixth indication in rheumatology. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from rheumatologists has been positive with access in the U.S. expected to ramp quickly over the rest of the year. Finally, we announced impressive Phase III results in alopecia areata, a chronic autoimmune disease leading to unpredictable hair loss with nearly 2 million diagnosed patients globally. Alopecia areata as well as the next wave of diseases, including Vitiligo, HS and lupus, would expand Rinvoq's treatment in both dermatology and rheumatology areas where we already have very strong call points with Rinvoq's core indications.\nTurning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.1 billion, down 58.2% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We anticipate Humira access in the U.S. will continue to decrease throughout the second half of this year as more plans select exclusionary formularies for existing patients.\nMoving to oncology which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion. [ IMBRUVICA ] global sales were $754 million, down 9.5%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL and partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta global revenues were $691 million, up 8.3% on an operational basis. This reflects strong demand in CLL with combination use of Venclexta plus BTK inhibitors emerging as a preferred fixed duration treatment. We are also seeing nice momentum from [ Ella here and up Kinley ], with both delivering double-digit revenue growth.\nAnd we are early in the U.S. launch of [ AMrellIs ], our newest ADC for previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. This commercialization will help to establish c-MET expression as a valid biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer and also build AbbVie's presence more broadly in solid tumors where we have several promising next-generation ADCs in development, including TMAb A, which shares the same c-MET target.\nTurning now to Aesthetics, which delivered global sales of nearly $1.3 billion, down 8% on an operational basis. Botox Cosmetic global revenues were $692 million and [ JUVEDERM ] global sales were $260 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. Consistent with the past few quarters, economic challenges and lower overall consumer sentiment have impacted the aesthetics market, which continues to perform below historical levels. As noted on the first quarter call, we moderated our assumptions for near-term category growth globally, which is tracking largely in line with our expectations.\nFrom a competitive perspective, our facial injectable portfolio remains the clear leader with strong market shares globally. Our progress with the [ Ali ] loyalty program is going well, and we have robust plans underway to support patient activation. This includes a new Botox consumer campaign in the U.S. with ramping second half investment, continued injector training globally and bringing new products to market like [ Trenibot-E ], our fast-acting short-duration toxin with commercialization expected next year.\nSo as economic conditions improve from current levels, we remain very well positioned for growth over the long term in the aesthetics category.\nMoving now to Neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area where we continue to demonstrate robust growth. Total revenues were approximately $2.7 billion, up 24% on an operational basis. This exceptional performance is driven by continued double-digit operational growth of Vraylar with global sales of $900 million, up 16.3%. Botox Therapeutic, with global revenues of $928 million, up 14.2%. Ubrelvy with global sales of $338 million, up 47.2%, and Qulipta with global revenues of $267 million, up 76.9%. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from the head-to-head TEMPLE study comparing Qulipta to topiramate for migraine prevention. TEMPLE demonstrated that Qulipta had fewer treatment discontinuations attributed to adverse events as well as a significant reduction in migraine days versus topiramate. Given the high use of topiramate as a frontline treatment for migraine prevention, we anticipate these strong results will support earlier adoption of Qulipta.\nMoving to Parkinson's disease. I'm very pleased with the performance of Vyalev, where the global launch is off to an excellent start. Total sales were $98 million, up 56% on a sequential basis. Feedback from movement disorder specialists has been overwhelmingly positive with uptake across the international markets exceeding our expectations. Looking forward, we believe our emerging Park Parkinson's disease portfolio with [ BioLab ], Duodopa and Tavapadon forthcoming has the collective potential to a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the long term. So overall, I'm very pleased with the execution and continued strong performance across our commercial portfolio.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights. Roopal?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP of Development & Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer\n\nThank you, Jeff. Starting with immunology, where we continue to make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since the last earnings call. FDA approval was granted for Rinvoq in GCA, representing our sixth rheumatology indications. Additionally, top line data from the first Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial were just announced. In the study, Rinvoq met the primary and key secondary end points, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in hair regrowth across both Rinvoq doses compared to placebo. Baseline scalp coverage prior to treatment was approximately 16%.\nIn the Rinvoq 30 milligram group, 54% of patients reached 80% or more scale pair coverage and 47% reached 90% or more coverage at 24 weeks. A robust effect was also demonstrated with Rinvoq 15 milligrams. These are truly transformative results and compare very favorably to the efficacy shown in pivotal trials for other JAK inhibitors. The placebo-adjusted SALT 20 and 10 scores for Rinvoq 30 milligrams were approximately 20 percentage points above the rates for the highest approved doses of other JAK inhibitors. For the Rinvoq 15-milligram group, rates were approximately 10 points above. We are very pleased with these results, which certainly surpassed our expectations.\nResults from a second Phase III alopecia areata study are anticipated in the third quarter, followed by regulatory submissions starting later this year. The vitiligo program for Rinvoq is also nearing completion, with top line results from Phase III studies expected later this year. External innovation has supported expansion of our growing immunology pipeline. We recently announced plans to acquire Capstan. Their novel platform allows for in vivo programming of cells through mRNA delivery using targeted lipid nano particles. Capstan's lead asset currently in Phase I generates CD19-specific, CD8-positive in vivo CAR T cells. The CAR T cells are designed to achieve rapid and deep B-cell depletion without the need for lymphoablating chemotherapy while also avoiding other challenges associated with conventional ex vivo CAR Ts.\nThis innovative approach has the potential to become a transformative new treatment modality to reset the immune system and provide deep, durable drug-free remission for patients with autoimmune disease. Capstan's technology is a strong strategic fit for our early immunology efforts, where we have a number of internal assets designed to reset the immune system via depletion of pathogenic cells with the goal of delivering functional cures. We plan to advance several assets that deplete B cells into the clinic, each with a different target or modality. These include 2 anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies that activate cell-mediated cytotoxicity, one with and the other without a payload team, [indiscernible] our BCMA CD3 bispecific T cell engager and [ ISB 2001, a BCMA CD38, CD3 trispecific T cell engager that is part of our recently announced agreement with IGI Therapeutics.\nAn interim analysis was recently completed on our monotherapy trial evaluating lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. Lutikizumab showed numerically higher efficacy for the primary endpoint of endoscopic improvement compared to Humira, which was the control arm. However, the results were not sufficiently differentiated for us to pursue it as a monotherapy in this population. We believe there is still opportunity to drive incremental efficacy as a combination therapy in Crohn's disease where lutakizumab is being evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. Lutikizumab is one of several assets being studied and results from our Crohn's combination platform study will begin to read out next year. lutikizumab has the potential to drive efficacy across other autoimmune diseases. It has demonstrated strong efficacy in hydratinitis supertiva, where Phase III is ongoing with data expected in 2027. Additional studies are underway evaluating monotherapy or combination approaches in psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nMoving to oncology. [ AMRElLis ] received accelerated approval from the FDA as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-Met expression. This is an important new treatment option for patients with this challenging disease. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented encouraging data for several novel ADCs in our oncology pipeline, including preliminary data from a Phase I dose expansion study evaluating TMAb A, our next-generation CMAT ADC in patients with EGFR mutated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. TMAb A demonstrated high and durable responses across c-Met expression levels with an objective response rate of 63% and median duration of response of 9.8 months. Based on these results, we plan to initiate additional studies in both first and second line.\nOther highlights from the AbbVie meeting included encouraging early-stage results for ABBV-706 and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors and results from a registration-enabling Phase II study evaluating PVEK in BPDCN, which will support a regulatory submission later this year. At the ESMO meeting this fall, we have several planned presentations for TMAb A, including results from a Phase II study in combination with [ bevacizumab ] in CRC as well as data from a proof of concept [indiscernible] in pancreatic cancer. We will also present updated data at the upcoming World Conference of Lung Cancer from our ABBV-706 dose-ranging proof-of-concept study in small cell lung cancer.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology, we recently announced a license agreement with IGI Therapeutics to develop a novel trispecific T-cell engager for multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases. This first-in-class T cell-engaging antibody targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and has the potential to deliver deep and durable responses, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. Despite advancements, the 5-year survival rate in multiple myeloma is still only about 60%. So unmet needs remain high.\nQuality of life is also important, patients currently receive triple and quad therapy, which can be challenging from a safety and convenience standpoint. HCPs and patients will continue to seek next-generation therapies that can provide high efficacy better safety and less complicated dosing regimens. We are extremely well positioned to address the unmet needs across all patient segments in multiple myeloma, with 3 next-generation multi-specific T cell engagers, [ Etentamag ], ISB 2001 and [ SIM0500 ]. These off-the-shelf therapies may be particularly important for community-based sites where approximately 80% of patients receive care.\nIn the area of Neuroscience, we announced positive top line results from the head-to-head Phase III TEMPLE trial comparing Qulipta and topiramate for migraine prevention. The primary and all secondary endpoints were met in the study, demonstrating that patients treated with Qulipta have fewer discontinuations due to adverse events and a greater reduction in migraine days compared to patients receiving topiramate. Over the 24-week treatment period, 12% of patients discontinued Qulipta due to adverse events compared to 30% for topiramate, 64% patients on Qulipta achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to 39% of patients on topiramate. These results add to the body of evidence supporting Qulipta as a first-line treatment option for episodic and chronic migraine prevention.\nIn the quarter, [ MAVIRET ] was approved for the treatment of acute HCV. With this label expansion, caregivers can now treat HCV patients immediately following diagnosis rather than waiting until progression to chronic disease. Earlier treatment, coupled with increased testing brings us closer to achieving the World Health Organization's goal on global HCV elimination by 2030.\nTo summarize, we've made significant progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and continue to expand our pipeline through internal and external innovation. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of 2025.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.97 which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.42 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.4% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 13.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 44.3% of sales, which includes a 5.3% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $678 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.88 and $12.08. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. This reflects a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. Our updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products and therapeutic areas.\nIn immunology, we now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $17.1 billion, an increase of $600 million reflecting continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD, and U.S. Humira revenues of $3 billion, a decrease of $500 million, reflecting biosimilar competition. In Neuroscience, we now expect global sales of $10.5 billion, an increase of $300 million. This includes a $100 million increase for [indiscernible], reflecting strong international uptake with the remaining $200 million increase split relatively evenly across Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and the total oral CGRP portfolio. And in oncology, we now expect [ IMBRUVICA ] global revenues of $2.9 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients, and Venclexta global sales of $2.8 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting continued strong demand in CLL.\nMoving to the P&L for 2025. We continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales. We now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $9 million and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.5 billion. We also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 45% of sales, in line with our previous expectations, after including the 1.8% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter.\nTurning to the third quarter. we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.5 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line performance, with results well ahead of our expectations. I'm pleased with the momentum from our ex-Humira platform, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Neuroscience, which further supports AbbVie long-term outlook.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll take the first question, please.",

All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ms. Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is off to an excellent start to the year with Q1 results exceeding expectations across several of our therapeutic areas. We also continue to advance our promising internal pipeline and add external opportunities to further strengthen our business and long-term outlook. Turning to our Q1 performance, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion, nearly $550 million ahead of our expectations.\nI'm especially pleased with the performance of our ex-HUMIRA platform, which delivered robust sales growth of more than 21%. Immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and Aesthetics are all performing at or above our expectations, and we are well positioned to exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second full year following the US HUMIRA LOE.\nBased on this strong performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted EPS between $12.09 and 12.29. As you are aware, there is speculation that sectoral tariffs could be forthcoming. Any related impact from these tariffs as well as other potential new or reciprocal tariffs have not been contemplated in our guidance. To the extent there is an impact, we believe it would be in line with our peers given that AbbVie has an extensive manufacturing presence in the US, including API, biologics, toxins, and small molecules. Over the next decade we anticipate investing more than $10 billion of capital in the US to support our volume growth and our expansion into new areas such as obesity.\nTurning back to our performance, I'm very pleased with the excellent progress we are making with several pipeline programs that have the potential to be meaningful sources of growth. These include Lutikizumab across several immunology indications, 383 and multiple myeloma, and our next generation ADCs including Temab-A for several solid tumor types and 706 for small cell lung cancer. We also continue to add depth to our pipeline with strategic transactions that can help drive growth in the next decade. This includes the recent acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to expand our immunology portfolio with oral peptides as well as a license agreement with Gubra to develop an amylin analog for the treatment of obesity. Obesity represents a significant global health concern with high unmet need. This market will continue to evolve with improved offerings and we believe our program with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset.\nGoing forward, we plan to invest further in obesity along with other opportunities across our existing five key growth areas.\nIn summary, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well positioned for the long term. AbbVie has a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff,\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nthank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.2 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing $5.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 65%. I'm especially encouraged with our portfolio performance across IBD, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to capture significant share given their efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles in Crohn's disease, which is roughly 2/3 of the overall IBD market. These two treatments together are capturing roughly 1/2 of in-play patients in the US, and total prescription share is now in the mid teens. Internationally, our Crohn's portfolio has achieved in play leadership in nearly a dozen key countries in ulcerative colitis.\nSkyrizi has already achieved the leading in-place share in the US following the launch in the second half of last year. Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are now capturing 1/3 of in-play UC patients, a very strong leadership position for AbbVie. We are also seeing strong momentum across indications in Dermatology, and Rheumatology as well. For Skyrizi, we continue to gain share in psoriatic disease where we have achieved the leading in-place share of new and switching patients in nearly 30 countries and see substantial room for total share growth. For Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing prescription demand globally across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, the fastest growing immunology market where we have two compelling head-to-head studies versus Dupixent.\nWe are also preparing for the global launch of giant cell arteritis, another new source of growth for Rinvoq. We received European approval earlier this month and expect FDA approval soon. The addition of this indication further rounds out Rinvoq's rheumatology label and gives patients with GCA access to a new compelling oral therapeutic option. Overall, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive results across all of their approved indications, and we will be raising our full year sales guidance for both products. Turning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, down 49.5% on an operational basis below our expectations, primarily due to faster share erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression in the US. As a result, we will be lowering our full year sales guidance for US HUMIRA, moving to oncology where total revenues were $1.6 billion, exceeding our expectations.\nImbruvica global sales were $738 million, down 11.9% reflecting competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global revenues were $665 million, up 12.3% on an operational basis. This strong performance reflects continued momentum in CLL as well as shared leadership in frontline AML among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We also have an emerging commercial portfolio in solid tumors. This includes Elahere, our leading ADC for ovarian cancer with global sales of $179 million, as well as Teliso-V, a potential new medicine for late-line non-small cell lung cancer patients. With US regulatory approval and commercialization expected in the next couple of months, Teliso-V will be supported by a dedicated sales force and medical affairs team which will target academic and community cancer treatment centers to reinforce the importance of c-MET as a biomarker and build relationships that support our emerging solid tumor franchise.\nTurning now to Aesthetics, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, down 10.2% on an operational basis. This was in line with our expectations. Botox Cosmetic global revenues were $556 million, down 10.7% on an operational basis, and Juvederm sales were $231 million, down 20% on an operational basis. As we have seen over the last several quarters, economic headwinds have continued to impact market conditions. Based on the trends we are seeing, including a decline in recent consumer sentiment, we are moderating our assumptions for category growth globally and adjusting our full-year sales guidance for Aesthetics accordingly. While near-term Aesthetics market conditions remain challenging, the long-term prospects for the category remain attractive given high consumer interest and low penetration rates for facial injectables. I'm particularly excited about BoNT, our fast-acting short-duration toxin, which we recently submitted for US regulatory review.\nThis first in class toxin represents a distinctive innovation for the treatment of glabellar lines and has the potential to be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the facial aesthetics category. We anticipate commercialization next year.\nMoving now to Neuroscience where total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, up 17% on an operational basis with all key products exceeding our expectations. Vraylar global sales were $765 million, up 10.3% reflecting share capture in both Bipolar 1 disorder and adjunctive major depression. We continue to get very positive feedback on Vraylar's profile in terms of dosing flexibility, low sedation, and the ability to treat a full spectrum of symptoms.\nWe are very competitively positioned with our migraine portfolio where all three of our therapies continue to deliver double digit operational growth. Botox Therapeutic global revenues were $866 million, up 17%. Ubrelvy global sales were $240 million, up 18%, and Qulipta global revenues were $193 million, up 48.3%. In Parkinson's disease via Vyalev, global sales were $63 million, reflecting continued strong uptake in Japan and Europe. We are also pleased with the early launch feedback in the US where revenues are expected to ramp gradually over the next couple of quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination.\nLastly, we are making excellent progress with the development of Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease. This first-in-class D1/D5 selective dopamine agonist has a favorable benefit-risk profile and the potential to differentiate in several areas such as sedation and impulse control. Tavapadon could potentially be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunctive therapy to Levodopa for more advanced patients, which would be a complementary addition to our existing PD portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa. We expect to submit Tavapadon for regulatory review later this year with commercialization expected in 2026.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with the execution and strong momentum across our commercial portfolio, and with that I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nRoopal, thank you, Jeff. I will start with immunology. We received European approval for Rinvoq in GCA and expect FDA approval soon. We remain on track for several important data readouts this year as well, including phase III data for Rinvoq and alopecia areata and vitiligo, and data from Skyrizi's head-to-head study in psoriasis vs. SOTYKTU. Our early and mid-stage immunology pipeline continues to advance. Recent initiations include a phase II study evaluating Skyrizi in combination with Lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and a phase I study for our next generation TL1A antibody, which is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This summer we will start a phase II study evaluating a combination of Lutikizumab and our anti-CD40 Ravigalimab in rheumatoid arthritis.\nMoving to our ADCs and oncology, we anticipate accelerated approval in Q2 for Teliso-V as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-MET expression. This is a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need, and when approved, Teliso-V will be the first c-MET-directed ADC for these patients.\nWe're also making good progress with Temab-A, our next generation c-MET ADC. A phase II dose optimization study evaluating Temab-A with a PD1 inhibitor as a front line combination therapy in eGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer was recently initiated in the eGFR immune segment. We plan to initiate studies for Temab-A as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first line setting. Preliminary phase I results will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting this year. Phase II data from our CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab will be available, which could enable a phase III study in an all-comers population.\nProgress also continues with ABBV-706 in small-cell lung cancer. This ADC utilizes the same TOPO-I warhead and linker technology as Temab-A but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. In the phase I study, ABBV-706 was efficacious across doses with an objective response rate of approximately 60% in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer based on maturing duration of response and progression-free survival data. We plan to advance ABBV-706 into a trial in a relapsed/refractory population and a dose optimization study in combination with a PD-L1 in the frontline with the goal of establishing a chemo-sparing regimen as a new standard of care.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology. The data readout remains on track for the phase III Venclexta MDS trial, and if positive, our regulatory submissions would follow later in the year. A regulatory submission for PIVC and BPDCN is also planned for this year.\nWe continue to make good progress with our BCMA-CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. Recruitment is going well in the phase III monotherapy study in later lines, and we are on track to be fully enrolled by early next year. Additionally, we continue to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid, Darzalex, and Iberdomide. We'll begin seeing data from these combinations next year, which could enable phase III studies in earlier lines of therapy.\nNow moving to neuroscience, our data from the long-term TEMPO-4 phase III study continue to support Tavapadon's favorable benefit risk profile. Efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinson's patients was maintained beyond a year, and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the previous phase III studies with no new safety concerns identified. Rates of adverse events of special interest remain low, with impulse control disorder and peripheral edema less than 1%, dyskinesia approximately 2%, and sedation less than 5%. These results underscore Tavapadon's potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease. Our regulatory application is planned for later in the year.\nMoving to other areas of our pipeline in aesthetics, the regulatory application for our rapid-onset short-acting toxin BoNT was recently submitted. We also began the clinical program to evaluate co-administration of BoNT and Botox, which has the potential to be co-formulated as a novel product offering the combined benefits of rapid onset and Botox-like duration.\nIn obesity. Our partner Gubra recently announced positive interim results from the first part of a multiple ascending dose study for our long-acting amylin analog ABBV-295. This initial phase of the study tested one and two mg dosed once weekly for six weeks in healthy, lean, and overweight patients. The study showed ABBV-295 performed well, demonstrating a dose-dependent mean weight loss compared to placebo and a tolerability profile consistent with the results from the single ascending dose study. Mean weight loss in the two mg cohort, which had a mean BMI of 24, was 7.8% compared to a weight gain of 2% in the placebo arm on day 43. The second phase of this study is ongoing and is evaluating higher doses in overweight and obese patients with 12-week dosing. Titration and longer dosing intervals will also be assessed.\nFull data from this part of the study are expected next year.\nTo summarize, significant progress continues with our pipeline and we look forward to important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our Q1 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPRD expense.\nTotal net revenues were more than $13.3 billion, reflecting robust growth of 9.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.1% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 24.6% of sales.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.3% of sales, which includes a 1.9% unfavorable impact from acquired IPRD expense.\nNet interest expense was $627 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.09 and $12.29. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPRD expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion, an increase of $700 million.\nThis reflects an estimated 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nThis updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products. We now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $16.5 billion, an increase of $600 million, reflecting share gains in psoriasis and IBD, Rinvoq global sales of $8.2 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting momentum across all approved indications.\nUS HUMIRA revenues of $3.5 billion, a decrease of $500 million reflecting higher erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression.\nBotox Therapeutic global sales of $3.6 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting growth in chronic migraine and other indications.\nTotal oral CGRP revenues of $2.2 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting strong prescription demand.\nImbruvica global revenues of $2.8 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting lower erosion. Venclexta global sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflects continued uptake in both CLL and AML across our key countries. And for Aesthetics, we now expect global sales of $5.1 billion as we are moderating our assumptions for market growth globally. As a result, total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million.\nMoving to the P&L for 2025, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion.\nWe now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $8.9 billion reflecting additional investment in our robust pipeline for long-term growth.\nWe also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales in line with our previous expectations after including the 0.4% unfavorable impact of acquired IPRD expense incurred through Q1.\nTurning to the Q2, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15 billion. This reflects an estimated 0.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 49.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.26 and 3.30. This guidance does not include acquired IPR and expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nOur guidance is based on current trade rules and does not reflect the impact of any additional trade policy shifts including pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While it's difficult to quantify in the absence of actual policy details, it's worth noting any related unfavorability in 2025 would reflect a partial year. Given the timeline for a 232 investigation.\nWe are actively preparing for a number of potential scenarios and would expect to put into place mitigation strategies as we have more information.\nRelevant to these dynamics. I would also highlight that AbbVie has a significant US manufacturing presence that spans 11 sites, with plans to add four new manufacturing plants to our network, expanding our production for API, drug product, peptides, and devices in the US.\nAs we continue to invest and grow our US operational footprint, we believe a more competitive tax policy building on what was accomplished through 2017 tax reform will encourage a sustainable shift towards US manufacturing over the long term.\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our first question, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThanks for the question and congrats on the results. Just two for me. Maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Obviously some big step up in the guidance here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on which of the indications are most attributable to the upside we're seeing right now? And maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, maybe particularly Tremfya more broadly launching in IBD and how you're thinking about that dynamic. And then just my second question was on staying in immunology on HUMIRA. Can you just talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the tail for HUMIRA in light of some of the erosion that you're seeing this year? Thanks so much.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nChris. This is Scott. I'll start with kind of where we saw the increase attributed to for the various indications. I'll turn to Jeff for your other questions. We raised Skyrizi by $600 million to $16.5 billion, and that's split between $200 million in psoriatic and $400 million in IBD indications.\nWith respect to Rinvoq, we raised that $300 million and that's across all of the approved indications. So you can attribute that to 100 for rheumatology, 100 for derm, and the remaining 100 for IBD.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. It's Jeff. Maybe I'll give some sense. We're obviously very, very pleased with the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in immunology. As you've seen from the report.\nMaybe to give some perspective, you know, it's not uncommon to start to see in-class competition. We've seen that in psoriasis. We've seen that across the board. Maybe I'll just give a little.\nBit of a perspective over sort of.\nThe historical dynamics that we've seen with the IL23 category. So for example, if you go back to like 2018, 2019, when the IL23s were starting to come in psoriasis, the total patient share at that time in the early days was about 7% of the IL23 class. Now it's over 60%. And if we look at where IBD is, you know, obviously we launched first with Skyrizi in Crohn's and you know, everything's recently launching here in UC, it's about 7% of the total patient share in IBD. So you can imagine as we start to watch what this category is going to mean to transform IBD, we remain very confident. It's not a zero-sum game. We feel very confident in our profile and what we're able to deliver if we look across UC, if we look across our head-to-head data versus sequence versus the other trials.\nNet-Net, we see very, very strong momentum across the board, regardless of competitors that may come in. My thoughts on the HUMIRA tail again as I highlighted and Scott highlighted in his remarks, you know, we are seeing a bit of faster erosions as the biosimilar start to play out. This is of course the third year of the biosimilar event, so it's really not too surprising. We also do continue to see the molecule continue to erode. As we look and we don't have full visibility and we'll be monitoring the 2026 access as we go throughout the year, we do expect it to step down again. Just makes sense that will be the fourth full year.\nSo we'll have deeper visibility of that tail sometime over the course of the year. But as we said before, the real impact of the tail is when HUMIRA does not have a meaningful headwind to our overall growth as a corporation. So we expect that to start to develop over that 2026 time period.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nOkay, thank you, Scott. Operator. Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please. Go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Pharma and Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\nThanks so much.\nCongrats on the quarter.\nMaybe two questions for me as well.\nYou know, you alluded to some of.\nThe mitigation strategies you're taking with respect to tariffs potentially. Could you just elaborate little bit more there in terms of what that means for maybe inventory, and then any contemplation on any changes to IP domiciling? And the second question I had is on your amylin program there. I know you talked a little bit about next steps, but was just wondering if you can elaborate in terms of how much higher you're going on doses, what you'd expect that to translate to in efficacy, and maybe the size of those cohorts, like how many more patients will we get in this next update?\nThank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. This is Rob. So Scott and I will handle your first question, and Roopal will handle your second question. So just to, I think, back up and maybe talk about, you know, AbbVie's manufacturing network and then I can mention how we're thinking about potential mitigation. I think it's important to know that, you know, we have a broad footprint that allows us to assure supply for our patients around the world. And that's really why you've been able to see us avoid supply disruptions during events like the COVID pandemic. I mean, and today we have a robust US manufacturing network with more than 6,000 American workers across 11 sites. As I mentioned in my remarks, that includes manufacturing of API, biologics, toxins, and small molecules. You know, for example, our largest product, Skyrizi, is made in the US for the domestic market.\nGiven our expected volume growth and our expansion into areas like obesity, as I mentioned, we'll continue increasing our US footprint with over $10 billion in planned capital investment during the next decade. In terms of potential mitigation in the near term, we could take inventory management actions or secure alternate sources of API. We could also look at cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives as a source of mitigation, which we always do. I think what's more challenging is trying to pass the tariff impacts to our customers, especially with penalties in the government channel, and with existing contracts in the commercial setting. So I don't see that as a viable source for mitigation. Longer term, we will add more US manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned capital investment of over $10 billion.\nSo specific to 2025, we would look to mitigate the impact as much as possible with a combination of supply chain actions, cost efficiencies, and any additional over performance from our growth platform. But in the meantime, we have enough confidence in the momentum of our business to raise our guidance this year, which should be viewed as a positive.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYes, then Dave, with respect to IP, you know, IP has been looked at. I think when people try to assess the impact of potential tariffs on our sector, IP has been looked at as kind of a proxy as to what that impact might be, and certainly directionally, I think that is something that would be somewhat telling. You know, that said, when we look at our profile overall, Rob mentioned the strong US presence that we have, but we don't see our profile suggesting any sort of outsize impact for us as a company. You know, the tax rate is something that you can look at, which is essentially when you think of the bookends of the minimum tax for earnings outside the US, for tax earned in or income earned in the US.\nThat really kind of aligns with where that IP is structured, and that blending of your incomes kind of produces generally directionally your tax rate. You see us being relatively in line with our peers, and so that suggests that we have a similar IP profile from an overall perspective. I'd also just quickly point out that sometimes with Allergan, as that was a company that we redomicile back to the US, it was a foreign headquarter company. Recall that Allergan was a series of several companies that were put together over a few years, and those companies all have a significant US presence as well. So Allergan's profile is not dissimilar from ours as a whole either. So I think when you think about that IP profile, it's important from a tariff perspective. It's also very important from a tax reform perspective.\nThere was a lot of progress made in leveling the playing field for US companies in 2017 tax reform that did a lot of good things and really helped invest in the US as well as create a competitive environment for our companies. We see it as an important piece of building upon that tax reform to encourage further and long-term, as I mentioned in my remarks, sustainable investment. I see a tax reform initiative building on 2017 coupled with tariffs as something that will encourage US manufacturing over the long term. We feel very good about our profile right now.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal, and I'll answer the ABBV-295 question regarding the multiple ascending dose study. Currently, with the data you've seen, we're at one and two milligrams. We have the opportunity here in this study to go several-fold higher than the two milligrams. We also have the opportunity to go beyond six weeks, namely around 12 weeks, before we get into formal phase IIB, which I would say around next year, which we would go quite a bit longer. The sample size, what you've seen here, may be a little bit larger because of the multiple ascending dose format here. We'll see larger sample sizes once we get into the formal phase IIB. The other opportunities here are also to look at titration at the one milligram or maybe even lower. We don't see any adverse events beyond suppression of appetite.\nSo there's an opportunity to be able to start low and start titrating up to doses quite a bit higher than two milligrams. But we're open to watch this study and be flexible. The other important findings would be around muscle and bone. So those would be other things that will be evaluated as well as looking at dosing. The half-life is around 270 hours, so that could give us an opportunity to go twice a month and even potentially monthly. So all that will be captured in this data set. We expect to see some data next year and then that will allow us to best design a more formal phase IIB study.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Cantor. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cantor\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for taking the question. Obviously there's been a lot of discussion around drug pricing kind of resurfacing, and some rumblings around Most Favored Nation kind of bubbling back to the surface.\nWanted to get a sense understanding of.\nYour expectations and flexibility, if need be, to take actions outside the US and.\nMaybe more of a commercial question.\nAs we think about the potential co-administration of BoNT and Botox.\nCan you kind of help frame how you think that would impact the market?\nIs this something that could just grow the overall pie, move share, et cetera?\nAny thoughts on that front would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nHey, Carter, it's Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second question. I think as we study the environment, we are very supportive of a balanced approach that addresses affordability while also encouraging innovation. You've seen many of our peers reinforcing the importance for the EU to properly value innovation, which we echo and would support any policies that encourage that outcome. That said, we hope the administration contemplates the harm that international reference pricing could have on US healthcare, the US healthcare industry, and future innovation. I think anything like price controls, cost increases, or higher taxes just leaves less investment available across the industry to advance new innovative medicines. That said, I'm very encouraged by the administration's willingness to address the pill penalty in the IRA, and as fixing that would support long-term innovation in our industry.\nAnd so as we look at the push, I think for the EU to more properly value the innovation is an absolute appropriate push. We're encouraged by some of the policies that really support innovation. You know, Scott also talked about tax reform, and I think that's an important lever as well. As we think about, you know, what are the things that will drive investment in the US and drive more innovation. I think if you just look at AbbVie as an example, we've invested over $5 billion of capital since tax reform in 2017. I mean that includes a new oncology research center in South San Francisco, Skyrizi manufacturing capabilities in the US, eye care capacity expansion in Waco, Texas, and technology infrastructure upgrades across our footprint, just to name a few.\nImportantly, as Scott mentioned, tax reform allowed us to acquire Allergan, an Irish-domiciled company that we then redomiciled into the US. I mean that transaction enabled AbbVie to continue increasing our R&D investment through the HUMIRA LOE, which is unprecedented. That will ultimately help us really lead to more innovation in our pipeline and ultimately impact patients of the future. So when we think about policy, we think tax reform has provided the right incentives to invest more in the US and more in innovation, and that's what we would encourage.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, and thank you for the question. Let me give a quick update on the BoNT and the combination approach in terms of how we're starting to think about it. Obviously we're super pleased with the recent filing on BoNT. As we've highlighted before, the short acting toxin will operate on two different levels for us. First it will stimulate the funnel. It will basically be a market stimulator because we know there's lots of considerers in the marketplace that are just worried about going to a full strength toxin because it lasts for three to four months. The approachability of a short acting toxin that works in about eight and a half hours and is gone in two and a half weeks makes the market much more approachable for the people in the consideration phase.\nSo we think it's going to work on the market and our share because obviously we've done studies with Botox after BoNT now in the combination used. Carter, it's very interesting. This is more of a pure sort of share play when we talk to the consumers. Many of the consumers are using a lot of Botox, and you start saying, can you imagine a Botox that works almost immediately? So an immediate acting Botox that gives us the potential. And we'll have to see how those trials and those studies play out to actually restate the whole market. Because what's remarkable about BoNT is that we can see a two-grade change in the glabellar lines in eight and a half hours. So nothing has ever worked even close to that fast.\nSo we could even have a premium toxin that sits alongside Botox, day one, or a replacement product for just simply a better Botox, an immediate-acting Botox. So it gives us a lot of flexibility, and it's certainly very exciting. As Roopal has highlighted, the program that will begin here for the combination.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nHi all, thanks for taking the question today. I wanted to loop back to part of the inventory and tariff conversation. We've been able to get some explicit answers from some of the peer companies. So just wanted to see if you were able to give us context as to whether you have enough inventory in the US to support products like Rinvoq, Botox, Vraylar, or HUMIRA for the rest of this year. What about 2026 and 2027? And then the second question is just on the back of the prior BoNT question. Can you give us a little bit of context as to the pricing strategy for that kind of treatment market because arguably kind of with a shorter duration.\nTime horizon, you have kind of less value. And so I'd love to see understand a little bit more about how you're thinking about placing these products together. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second look. Absent policy details, we're not going to get into speculating on the impact. I think you've known us to be a company that once we have a full understanding, we're very transparent and detailed. If you think about how we approached the Part D benefit redesign, as soon as we understood that impact, we were well in advance of the implementation of that, discussing the impact on the company. But with tariffs, we don't have the policy details for sectoral tariffs. So it's premature to speculate on the impact. And once we have that information, we'll.\nCommunicate at the appropriate time.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nRegarding the pricing. Obviously, since we just had the filing, it's premature. We'd go through a very rigorous pricing analysis as we would get closer to launch, and some of the considerations that we would look for, which is obviously, as I mentioned, the rotation of even more patients into the assessment brings a lot of value to those practices. And if you think about it, the lifetime value of those new patients is very meaningful. So that could play into dynamics of ultimately how we price the BoNT once we ultimately make that decision sometime next year. Obviously it does work shorter, so that might imply a different or lower price point to start the trial.\nBut those are all considerations commercially that we will go through, as we go through our launch readiness process over the course of the year, to really optimize the impact of that product as we bring it to the market.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Courtney. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nSenior Biotech and Pharmaceutical Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress.\nI would like to understand a little bit more about your thought process around?\nGubra's Amylin and there have been a couple of strategies.\nOf course Novo is trying to.\nCombine it with GLP-1, but then there is a strategy or thought process that.\nAmblin could be a good agent as a standalone agent.\nSo how are you thinking about this?\nEspecially with the longer acting version? Do you think there is a strategy to just use this as a single?\nAgent, especially among patients who cannot tolerate GLP-1? We'd love to get your thoughts. Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey, Mohit its Roopal, I'll take that. So thanks for highlighting some of the potential here, and I think we're thinking about it quite broadly. So as you stated, there's an opportunity here as a monotherapy. I think the way we think about it is tolerability is key. We see a number of dropouts upwards of 30% even after a month of starting with the current set of assets. And then when we look over the course of the year, 60% to 70 of the patients will drop. Now, there's a variety of factors that drive that discontinuation, but a key component is tolerability. So to have a monotherapy that's tolerable, that provides meaningful weight loss and potentially has other potential benefits. We've seen preclinically preservation of muscle. We'll have to see if that plays out, but that could be another benefit in the long term when this launches.\nWe do anticipate many of the patients will have already been on.\nAssets that are available today. So it could serve as a nice follow on for folks that couldn't tolerate or came off for other reasons and want to go somewhere else. Now, in terms of combinations, recall when we did this deal, one thing we liked about it was also the neutral pH of the formulation. So that could enable combinations with a variety of mechanisms. As Rob stated, we continue to be interested in this space and we'll be thinking about other potential opportunities which could include combinations that may drive further weight loss. But key for us would be tolerability and.\nDurability of use.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. Two questions. First of all, Bristol appears to think there's a path forward with Cobenfy in adjuvant schizophrenia based on existing data. Where does AbbVie stand in its analysis of the future of Emraclidine? For instance, has a path forward become more clear in the last few years, few months? Secondly, I believe AbbVie has more plants in Ireland than any other company. Curious how you think about that as well as your overall OUS footprint. Do you cut back OUS to invest in the US or do you maintain the presence of OUS? Given the fact that in four years we could have a different administration with very different views and related to this topic. Yesterday Roche said that their US plants are 50% utilized. I'm wondering if AbbVie would share a similar percentage. Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey, it's Roopal. I'll start with the schizophrenia questions. In terms of the recent data, it's difficult for us to comment. I think that'll be a discussion between the company and health authorities regarding the utility of a failed study.\nThat would be their discussion to have. How we look at Emraclidine is that we do still see potential and we want to approach this in a stepwise manner. The first step would be to look to see if we can further dose escalate beyond what was previously studied. We saw variable PK levels in those patients from the pivotal studies. Some were low and we think there's an opportunity to raise that. So a multiple ascending dose study will be initiated this year and that would apply to potentially monotherapy and schizophrenia as well as the adjunctive setting.\nSo as that data rolls out and if we're able to utilize a higher dose, then we would again stepwise go forward into a phase II setting to further de-risk and apply our learnings in terms of trial design. And then if we see strong data there, which could be as a monotherapy, could be as an adjunct, and also in neurodegeneration psychosis, then we would move into the phase III setting. But I would say we still believe there's opportunity here.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThen.\nSteve, this is Rob. I'll take your question on the manufacturing footprint. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, obviously AbbVie, we have a very broad footprint. An important part of the strategy is to assure supply. As I mentioned earlier, we went through a global pandemic without any supply disruptions, and that strategy certainly paid off. We also have, I'd say, a very robust manufacturing network in the US. I think what's been widely misunderstood is Skyrizi as an example. Our largest product is made in the US, and so when we look at our global footprint, we consider assurance of supply. As Scott mentioned earlier, clearly, obviously tax has an influence on longer term how you'd want to structure your supply chain. Certainly I think with a more competitive tax policy that sort of provide the appropriate incentives.\nWe try to say we have obviously been ramping our volume considerably. You look at just the performance, just think about biologics capacity and just the tremendous ramps we've seen for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And so we stay ahead of the curve, we ensure that we are investing appropriately so we can keep up with that demand. I'd say the commercial team puts a lot of pressure on operations because they're performing so well. But operations stays ahead of the curve and invests appropriately.\nAnd so when we look at the investment, and when I mentioned the greater than $10 billion investment that takes into account, in the US, that takes into account our volume growth that we expect in addition to new areas that we will invest in, for example, peptide manufacturing as an example, as we enter that space, obviously now as we enter into obesity, it makes sense to add that capability. And so that will also be part of our supply chain strategy here. So that's the way we're thinking about it.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nAll right, thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much, and congrats on the performance. So, I have two questions, please. And they're both a bit high level. So, the first is the industry is facing three major US government risks, actions that are harming biopharma innovation, including significant FDA disruption and questioning of proven medical science, tariff threats. And also, the Trump administration's agenda to take prices down more than the Biden administration took down drug prices. So, considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington of the benefits that the biopharmaceutical industry brings to Americans, can you please comment on how your executive team and board are engaging differently today with Washington leadership to change the political agenda for the better? And then, second, the press release mentions that guidance doesn't reflect any trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs.\nCan you describe the potential trade policy shifts that you're considering or thinking of beyond tariffs? Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nDavid, I'll take the first question. Roopal, you can certainly add on as it relates to the FDA. And then Scott, you can take that last question. So you know, we're obviously not a member of [PhRMA] today. AbbVie, but we do continue to communicate with the association really to seek alignment on the most critical issues for the industry. Now, AbbVie has a large government affairs organization that engages with lawmakers and the administration on our top policy priorities, and that includes tax reform. We've talked about that quite a bit today: IRA, 340B, and patient affordability in Medicare. And we have actually seen some positive results from that engagement. I mean, just this week, Congress released a report on 340B which included a recommendation that changed the law to more clearly define a patient, which should help address the abuse that is occurring with this program.\nI would also view the 340B policies in the latest executive order as a positive. I also previously mentioned that seeking to eliminate the pill penalty is a positive for innovation. So we will continue to work with lawmakers, as we always have, on policies that support a healthy US Biopharma industry, continued innovation, and patient affordability.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. Regarding FDA interactions, I would say our teams have been in active discussions with the FDA and on multiple programs across therapeutic areas, sometimes daily interactions, and no signals of a slowdown. We are monitoring the situation closely. However, thus far we haven't experienced any delays to our timelines.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie",
    "content2": "It's Scott, just with respect to your question on my initial comments.\nIt's just the trade policy shift we're talking about here: the pharmaceutical sector tariff or the potential pharmaceutical sector tariffs. It's not any additional things that we were contemplating. Certainly the environment has some uncertainty out there, but specific to that comment, we were speaking of the pharmaceutical sector tariffs.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nBiopharmaceutical Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. And I just, I don't think, sorry if I missed some of this, but one of the tariff discussions, I was curious about the aesthetic side. I know the pharmaceutical products are excluded from the current tariffs, but I thought products like your breast implants and Juvederm may be included right now. So it's curious if that's the case or not. And if it is, then why wouldn't there be some accounting for that in your new guidance or maybe you just absorb it within your guidance. Any impact there? And the second is just on the aesthetics side and appreciate the macro issues and all the macroeconomic pressures.\nI'm just curious if you can comment on the market share dynamics, and is there any sort of share shifts that you're seeing either in toxins or fillers that may be impacting things beyond the macro components? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. It's Scott. You were right. It's a great question regarding the current tariff rules that are in place. So, in general, pharmaceutical products and our products are exempt from those, similar to our peers. However, there's a couple exceptions to that. And then, specific to Aesthetics, yes, there are some application of the rules to Aesthetics, but we have absorbed the Aesthetics impact in the guidance, and I will tell you it's modest. It's something approximately $30 million. So, something fairly modest in the current rules, and that's something that we have absorbed. So, all of the guidance that I gave and reported today from the margin profiles and otherwise includes us absorbing.\nThat's\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah Vamil yes. So I'll go over your market share, give you some flavor on that, and I'll focus on our two big markets.\nThe US and China. As I mentioned, we were right on our guidance, right on our forecast.\nFor Q1.\nRemember the biggest impact there was the price because we reversed the alley redesign from last year. So when we looked at basically what happened from Q3 to.\nQ4 to Q1.\nWe know we took a market share hit in toxins in that Q4. The good news is we've seen a complete reengagement in basically the old ALI program with all of our accounts. So things are quite stable. We actually had a one market share point gain back from where we were. Now we still have to gain some more share over the course of the year to come back to where we were pre the change to Alli. We have lost year over year some share in toxins in the US and filler. Our share is very, very stable. We did not see a significant share impact on the filler side the business. It's just been sort of a double-digit market pressure there. Now in China, I'm quite pleased with the share performance.\nWe've recently had a couple of significant approvals. Sequentially, we have the masseter approval.\nFor Botox, which is sort of in.\nThe lower face and jawline, and also Volux, which is in Juvederm. So we've actually seen significant positive momentum in Botox share in China as well as positive share in filler. So it's a little variable across the board. Our big push will be to recover that share over the course of the year in the US toxin space. Hope that helps.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Alexandria Hammond from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics Research, Wolf Research\n\nThanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have consistently surpassed expectations, but we've been getting some questions on what might drive long term growth in INI as it relates to these assets. Could you comment on when we should start seeing results from your Skyrizi and Rinvoq combination trials? And as a follow up, what combination are you most excited about from a mechanistic perspective? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll start on the Skyrizi question and the combinations. So.\nThe studies have initiated, and we would anticipate next year starting to see early data readouts. And I would say we're excited about several of these mechanisms. We've utilized quite a bit of data that we've already collected to see what could be the best combination, and ultimately clinical data will guide that path. But we use biopsy data. The team has applied machine learning to these data sets, spatial omics, a variety of different techniques, and the ones that we like are one, the Alpha 4 Beta 7 combination. We think that could be a good combination. We like Lutikizumab, which is a bispecific to anti-IL-1 alpha and, importantly, IL-1 beta. We see that overexpression in patients with IBD that have failed other advanced therapies. We see something similar for TREM1, which would be another potential combination.\nAnd then as I mentioned, we also have a longer acting agent designed to be longer acting TL1A that could also be a very good fit with IL-23 like Skyrizi. The other thing we'll be doing, since I mentioned a variety of different combinations, is also capturing a number of biomarkers to see if there's any potential for pretreatment segmentation in the future, consistent with what we do in oncology. Thus far, no real successes. I would say, maybe there's hints in TL1A, but we're gonna generate that data as well to see if there's opportunities to be able to use biomarkers in the future to segment these patients.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nMaybe Alexandria, I might add, when we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, certainly we're very pleased with the strong demand in the quarter, and that led to us taking a combined $900 million of increased guidance for the year. We've also given the long-term guidance in 2027, which we continue to feel very confident in. Also, I think it's worthwhile to think about Rinvoq will have a second wave of indications towards the end of the decade. They'll add a couple billion dollars of sales. We really see these two products, even before the combination that Roopal spoke about, as having a long runway for at least the next eight years. We feel very good about that from that perspective.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll just add on to that. I think strategically when we look at the company and we have this clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, we can use that time, and obviously we're looking to elevate the standard of care for immunology patients. We think these combination studies are a way to accomplish that. But we're going to use that time to just as we did with HUMIRA; we came up with Skyrizi and Rinvoq as a way to elevate the standard of care. And you know, that was the second that really launched us into a second chapter of the company.\nThe third chapter is going to be as we think about the growth beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and we have the time and we're investing appropriately to identify what those drivers will be, and you know, within immunology and outside of it. I mean, we have five key growth areas that we're very confident can drive growth. But obviously you've now seen us enter the obesity space as we think about more sources of growth, and we think that's also an opportunity. So we think the company is very well positioned to grow very nicely for at least the next eight years and then use that time and the investment that's available to grow beyond that.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Alexandria Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thank you for the question. Had a question on current immunology price volume dynamics specifically: is the low single-digit headwind being realized? If so, is it somehow being blended where HUMIRA is seeing outsized headwinds while Skyrizi and Rinvoq are seeing tailwinds? Or is there some sort of co-pay shift or is there a shift in co-pay utilization year over year or sequentially? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nJames. It's Scott. So I think I'll start with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at Q1, those were both driven by strong demand. Now we've talked about pricing being slightly negative for those two products on a full year basis. We did see a little bit of favorable price in the quarter, and that's just a timing issue. So in the quarter, probably two things. One, Jeff's organization continues to do a very good job of focusing on copay utilization and effectively managing that. So we saw a little bit of benefit from copay utilization, and then in addition we had anticipated some channel mix changes later in the year, but those actually came to fruition a little bit earlier than we thought.\nAnd so those factors, I would say, along with some other gating issues, combined being price favorability, but we still anticipate negative pricing headwinds on a full-year basis. With respect to HUMIRA, we talked about in the quarter on the full year that there is a decrease in volume associated with share erosion as well as the compression of the overall molecule. So that volume is going to continue. I think you'll see that volume a little bit more pronounced throughout the year, but there certainly continues to be some price. You've got some unwinds of accruals that cause price impacts, but you also have just the changing of the rebate dynamics as we entered into a new contract year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, James. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Rob had another one on policy. Wanted to get your perspective on PBM reform, which is often mentioned as highly likely to happen this year. What would you say are the main elements that you'd want to see in reform, and the second one on bd? Is there a therapeutic area that you guys feel like you still have to add to? I wasn't sure if neuro remains one of the top priorities. Just post-emraclidine, and it does seem like multiple shots on goal and metabolic disease is kind of the approach a lot of other biopharmas are taking, but I wanted to get your perspective. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nI'll take those questions. So on PBM reform, I think we're supportive of anything that helps with patient affordability, and so to the extent that that improves the dynamic on patient affordability, that that is truly realized.\nIn their pockets, that's favorable. So we are supportive of the efforts there, but it's really all about making sure that we're addressing patient affordability as it relates to business development. We obviously really like the five key growth areas that we have today. As I mentioned, those will certainly drive very strong growth for at least the next eight years. I think sometimes there's a misconception about neuroscience. For AbbVie, it's more than just psychiatry. We have a very strong migraine franchise that's performing exceptionally well in Parkinson's. We're seeing great results. And we've been in Parkinson's for a long time with Duopa. But as we think about the ramps we're seeing with BioLEV, that innovation we've brought for those patients, and Tovapodon, which came from Cerevel, we could really start to see our Parkinson's franchise emerge.\nAnd so when I think about neuroscience, I would think about it really in four segments. There's psychiatry; it's an important segment. There's migraine, there's Parkinson's, and there's all other neurodegeneration. We obviously are investing in Alzheimer's. So you just look at the business development activity. Since the beginning of last year in neuroscience, we extended our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. You know, we added a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. We acquired a next generation A beta antibody that's very promising for Alzheimer's from Aliada. We're also investing in novel approaches for migraine disease. So we are actively investing in neuroscience. We obviously added obesity because we do think of ourselves as being a company that's going to be very large in the next decade. So it doesn't hurt to have another source of growth.\nWe have evaluated various options beyond the five. We chose to move into obesity for a number of reasons. It's obviously an extremely attractive market, has high prevalence, and plenty of headroom for growth. It's a market that has ample space for multiple players and new entrants. I think we're also uniquely positioned with our Aesthetics business to access that channel in addition to therapeutics. Importantly, and it's something we always focus on, is where are there high areas of unmet need? As we think about our portfolio, that's really our strategy, is to drive a remarkable impact for our patients by elevating standard of care. When we look at obesity, there's plenty of opportunity, whether it's reducing GI side effects, improving body composition, more consistent weight loss across patient types, and longer lasting weight loss.\nAnd so as we evaluate that opportunity, we found the amylin class to be very attractive given it's the most validated non GLP1 mechanism for obesity and has very encouraging early data. And we believe the amylin opportunity with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. So, so we will continue investing in obesity, we'll continue investing in our five key growth areas, and we think that gives us the right mix to drive growth for the long term.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of US Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I have a question on drug advertising. So AbbVie is the number one spender on this. Hard to turn on a TV without seeing something like a Skyrizi ad, and that says you see a very positive ROI from that level of spending. As you know, there's an occasional talk by the administration about limiting such advertising. My question is, do you think there's any basis in reality for that? I know you'll say it shouldn't happen, but that doesn't mean that it won't potentially happen. Then on obesity, as you noted, your Amylin is long-acting. Doesn't that imply that a really kind of key next part of the portfolio is a long-acting GLP? Or are you not interested in the GLP-1 space at all?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks Tim. It's Jeff and you're right; it's difficult to know if DTC reform would take place or what it might look like. I think you're right. We're very supportive of the First Amendment rights to be able to advertise, and obviously we work with the FDA on every single claim that we make on television. If there were to be a change, we would be able to pivot. I mean we could shift our investment to disease awareness. That could help us drive because we have such leading in place share to continue to basically invest in the right way to consumers. We certainly could move to other channels because it's not really clear if it would just be mass media or et cetera. So certainly the whole market would take a step back if that were to happen.\nOur brands would still be very, very competitive in terms of our ability to pivot and toggle were that to happen. Difficult to predict. We would be of course planning for any of those contingencies were they to take place.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nTim, it's Roopal regarding different mechanisms, so as stated previously, we think there's opportunity as a monotherapy and also as a potential combination. I would say we haven't ruled out any particular mechanism that we would combine with. The other thing to mention, I think I already stated this, but we do have a neutral pH in the current formulation for ABBV-295. So that potentially makes it more amenable to combinations. But mechanisms that you mentioned and potentially others I would say are on the table for us.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Trung Hien from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Hien\n\nProgram Manager, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. I've got two questions if I can. So first, just very quickly, you did touch on the pricing dynamics with Skyrizi in Rinvoq, but did the strong performance include any notable one-time contributions, inventory build, or pull-forward effects? And then second, similar to Vamil's Aesthetics question, but China reciprocal tariffs have been enacted. Is that contemplated in your guide, and is that material to your Aesthetics business? And then just I know it's early days, but are you seeing any shifts in demand there? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nScott, I'll answer your questions. Thanks for the questions. So with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I would say the one item that I would point to. Again, this was strong demand overall. The one thing that also helped the growth in the quarter was with respect to the retail destocking. So in the past we've talked about there's some retail inventory buildup as a form of price speculation in the fourth quarter. I talked about on the fourth quarter call that we didn't see a lot of that. And then that was, you know, again confirmed. We did not see. There was no unwind like there has been a prior year. So there was a year-over-year benefit from that, the lack of destocking.\nFrom the retail buildup in Q1.\nBut again that was fairly modest. When we talk about our overall growth globally, 72% operationally, the demand was really in the 60s%, and so you just saw a small portion from that retail destocking. With respect to the China tariff, yes, you're right, there is some impact for Aesthetics in those products in those numbers. But again that impact is fairly modest. We've contemplated that in our guidance. And so I would say overall the existing tariffs you're talking about $30 million approximately globally, and a decent component of that is with respect to the Aesthetics business. And then maybe I don't know if Jeff would like to comment on; I think you'd ask if we've seen any demand changes in China.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nNo, we haven't over the last 30 days. I mean, obviously things are. Things change quickly. But as I mentioned, if we look at the quarter, we've been encouraged by the share growth we've seen in China based on the recent approvals for both the toxin and the filler category.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, operator. We have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our final question we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nConor MacKay\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi there, this is Conor MacKay on.\nFor Evan, thanks for taking our question and congrats on a great quarter. Botox and Elahere were two products that, outside of your INI business, came in sort of meaningfully ahead of analyst expectations. Can you maybe walk us through what's driving the strength for each of those?\nThank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start on your question and thank you for that. So certainly, as I mentioned in the prepared remark and Rob as well, Vyalev is emerging as a very, very important product, and we communicated certainly that it could continue to exceed expectations. So it's quite remarkable. We continue to see strong uptake in Japan, across Europe. And while we're only in the commercial market, which is about 30% of the market in the US because we're still waiting on the full Medicare reimbursement, the market feedback is exceptional. I mean, this is a really amazing product to help patients sleep through the night, control of movement disorders. It's unlike Duopa, it's. It lasts for 24 hours. It's a more simple Sub-Q injection versus surgery that you might get. So it's playing out exactly as we had hoped.\nAnd so you're just seeing some strength of that in the quarter. That's also why we remarked that we're excited to bring Tevapadon, which is also showing some very nice data here. And we're getting ready for the file to start to really build out a more meaningful Parkinson's category. And then Elahere, we continue to see nice uptake, very unique product. Obviously it's got a, you know, 30% improvement in overall survival. It's well tolerated non-chemo. So the US business continues to perform very well, and we are starting to see the international launches. We've pulled forward significant international launches from the time that we had had done the deal with ImmunoGen. And we're going to start to see those international launches ramp here over the next several quarters. So that gives some sense over that brand as well.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nConor, this is Rob. I'm glad you asked a question about Elahere because oncology doesn't get enough attention for the company. Elahere came to us through the ImmunoGen acquisition. It was a very successful acquisition. It basically combined their ADC capabilities with our, and now you're starting to see the AbbVie internally discovered ADCs emerge. We've talked about Teliso-V. We're very excited about Temab-A, ABBV-706. You think about long-term growth drivers for AbbVie oncology with that emerging pipeline. And Roopal and I both mentioned ABBV-383, the bispecific for multiple myeloma. We have, I think, a very exciting emerging oncology pipeline that could be an important growth driver for the company. So I appreciate the specific question about Elahere.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Colin. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining the AbbVie Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the AbbVie Q4 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings.\nAbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you Liz. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our Q4 performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie. And I am very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions. Turning to our results, we delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint excluding the impact of IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth with full year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of US Humira erosion in 2024. This outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform. Which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid single digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the US Humira LOE.\nGiven that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade. We have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These two assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion. Based on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027. Which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year.\nWe are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD. And we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications. Such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In Neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson's. In Oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor Venclexta, our FR Alpha ADC for ovarian cancer, ELAHERE, our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and ABBV-400, and our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, ABBV-383.\nLastly, while the recent performance in Aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the US and China. The category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect Aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. Turning now to R&D. We have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs.\nThese advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC. EPKINLY and later lines of follicular lymphoma. ELAHERE for FR Alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. VYALEV for advanced Parkinson's, and new indications for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA and Teliso-V for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson's, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for Aesthetics.\nWe have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024. Including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in Immunology, Oncology, and Neuroscience. We have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie's execution in 2024 and expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1% on a full year basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year over year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications.\nI'll share some highlights in the US. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors. With in-play capture rates remaining very strong. Over the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head to head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in market share in atopic dermatitis as our communication around our LEVEL UP study versus Dupixent continues to ramp.\nRecall that in LEVEL UP we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction. In RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-label share in the second-line plus market. Consistent with the brand's label. We see that US physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA. In psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-label share in the room category. Highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment.\nAcross IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly 2/3 of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-play share. With total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly in ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands. We see similar performance internationally as well where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So I'm very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains.\nAcross our existing indications in addition to the typical market growth we see across Rheum, Derm, and Gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition. We continue to see molecule compression in the US with volume moving to other novel mechanisms which has resulted in the benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts. It's reasonable to assume that roughly half of US covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full year basis. With select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year.\nMoving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2% reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis. Reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, ELAHERE continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR Alpha Positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the US are annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines.\nMoving to Neuroscience, where total full year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $924 million, BOTOX Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and QULIPTA with global revenues of $201 million. Beyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson's disease. We recently launched VYALEV, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. As a less invasive non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities.\nParkinson's experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night. While sales in the US are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I'm very encouraged by the data we are seeing for Tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. Tavapadon represents a very complementary addition to our Parkinson's disease portfolio with VYALEV and Duopa. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our Therapeutic portfolio which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on Aesthetics. Carrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q4 global Aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the US, Aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the US facial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years as a higher price procedure relative to toxins. Current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single digit percent growth.\nAlthough we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points. In October, we launched an updated version of our All? consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new construct was too complex to integrate into their practices. Therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original All? consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery.\nInternationally, Aesthetics sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower JUVÉDERM sales, as BOTOX Cosmetics sales were roughly flat on an operational basis. Our international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China. Where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we've planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth. In the US, this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers.\nAdditionally, based on our All? loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first quarter US results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment. In summary, while economic headwinds in key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions. We continue to see significant long-term growth potential given high consumer interest and low penetration rates. Allergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs starting with Immunology. Regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in Q2. Data for two Phase III Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HF and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi. Data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year.\nAlso, this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated. Additional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025. A Phase II study evaluating lutekizumab in atopic dermatitis. A Phase II study evaluating Skyrizi and lutekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn's disease platform, study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi. Moving to Oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones, as well as Phase transitions for key programs, are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-MET overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nThe target for an approval decision is in the first half of this year. This represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-MET directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-MET asset. A Phase III study evaluating ABBV-400 also known as Temab-A was recently initiated in patients with c-MET overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Temab-A as a monotherapy is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab this year.\nData from a Phase I CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a Phase III study in an all-comers population. Temab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A Phase II study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy in the EGFR-mutant segment. Results from the ongoing Phase I study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies. As a monotherapy in the second-line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first-line setting in gastroesophageal cancer. A Phase II trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD1 inhibitor in frontline patients.\nWe are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. Encouraging data in small cell lung cancer were presented at ASCO last year, and this year dose optimization and longer-term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second-line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the front-line. Moving to FR Alpha ADCs, ELAHERE is now approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in the US and Europe and is currently in Phase III development for the platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer segment. Also, a next-generation ADC targeting FR Alpha, IMGN151, is currently in Phase I. This year, ELAHERE will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor.\nIMGN151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard-of-care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin, and a PARP inhibitor. These mid-stage studies for ELAHERE and IMGN151 will be used to inform our Phase III approach in various settings for ovarian cancer. Including induction and maintenance in platinum-sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as Pivekimab sunirine targets a rare hematologic malignancy called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Based on positive data from the pivotal Phase II study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also, in the area of Hematologic Oncology, the Phase III Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year.\nNow moving to Neuroscience, following the emraclidine and EMPOWER-1 and EMPOWER-2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials. Our findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites when assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response. A clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase Ib. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals in schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit. Additionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of emraclidine.\nThis is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia as higher doses may result in greater efficacy. A multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year, and data will be available in the early part of 2026. Following this dosing work, Phase II studies in adjunctive schizophrenia, and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia, will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing, with Phase II studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson's disease, positive top-line results from the third Phase III trial for Tavapadon were recently announced.\nIn the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to levodopa-carbidopa. The six-month data from the Phase III studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well-tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer-term safety data will be available this year, and regulatory submissions will then follow. Moving to Aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines.\nWe are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year. To summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline in 2025. We anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones including many trial starts for key programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, our ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nNet interest expense was $610 million. The adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $2.32. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion, reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7%. Despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign.\nAt current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global Immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion. Reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion. Driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD. Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion, reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications.\nHumira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including US sales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In Oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion, including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion, which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. BOTOX sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign, and ELAHERE revenue of $750 million. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion, reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery. In the US this includes BOTOX Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for JUVÉDERM.\nFor Neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes VRAYLAR revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. BOTOX Therapeutic sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion, and VYALEV sales of $300 million. For Eye Care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions.\nWe forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024. Turning to the Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas, Immunology sales of $6.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion. We expect US Humira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate Oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion, which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original All? program, Neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion, and Eye Care sales of $550 million.\nWe are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and modeled a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion, and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception.\nAs well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie's results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nSenior Biopharmaceuticals Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to dive a little deeper on Rinvoq, obviously great performance and guidance, can you just comment a little more on pricing dynamics that you're seeing there? As for how you factored in pricing both for this year and maybe over the next several years. And then just a quick follow up on the comments that were given around Aesthetics, especially on the share side. I think you lost a few points but maybe getting it back, can you just give a sense of where you think the share is now for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM sort of at this point in time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThanks Vamil. It's Jeff, and I'll comment on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and I think we've been very consistent that. Over the near term and over time, this is a volume-based business. So we're going to see price declines year over year, but I would say modest, right. We've sort of highlighted that as we negotiate the formularies we've started to consistently see sort of these low single digit price concessions.\nNow obviously what Scott highlighted was unique for the 25 year with the Part D redesign that he outlined. So overall consistent low single digit price declines from the rebating side with a one-time Part D. We would anticipate once we lap the Part D we would see that sort of trend going forward.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Vamil, this is Rob. I'll just add that if you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our strategy here was to elevate the standard of care for patients and ultimately would drive a rapid return to growth for the company beyond Humira. And that's exactly what we've been able to execute. That strategy has played out. You see the differentiation in the marketplace. We have nine head to head studies, we're launching a few more. We've upgraded our guidance now by additional $4 billion in 2027.\nWe've been very consistent in our language around the pricing dynamics. You know, we said when you think about rebates, think about it as negative low single digits going forward. But given the robust performance of these assets, it's volume that's dominating the growth and we would expect that to continue.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your question around BOTOX and JUVÉDERM share. So in the US we remain the clear market leader for both toxins and fillers. In Q4, a few points of share erosion bringing BOTOX to around the low to mid-60s. JUVÉDERM to around the low to mid-40s. As I said, the reversion of the loyalty program back to the original one, which we announced in December and then put into action 21 January 2024, was greeted with very positive response from our customers.\nEncouraging signs for us to recapture that share for both BOTOX and JUVÉDERM throughout the year. Just to note that the share did not go to one competitor. Rather it was more distributed among the entire competitive set. Thanks Vamil, operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat thanks so much. Just a two-parter on the Skyrizi Rinvoq dynamics. Maybe just first on the 2027 guidance, can you just elaborate on what were the biggest drivers of upside to those targets? As you think about the various indications for the drugs, is it fair to think most of this coming from IBD or is it across the board, and then probably a longer term question on those brands. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about the growth rate beyond 2027? So basically how mature will these franchises be by then and what type of growth rates, can we think about over time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThanks Chris, it's Jeff. I'll start on that. So the primary driver of the change is in fact share capture. So you know, the pricing assumptions have been consistent. You know we can call the markets pretty well. We see the, we see the actuals and the long term trends there. So it's been really share capture and I would say that we see it across the board. Certainly we've been super encouraged with Skyrizi in psoriasis.\nWe continue to see very, very robust TRx share trends. And there's no question that the ramps in IBD have been very, very significant. So that's a big piece of it. But I would say it's across the board. So, predominantly share capture. I don't know if Scott, you have anything to add, but that's the big dynamic there on the $4 billion.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, Jeff, maybe Chris, it'd be helpful. I can give you the breakdown by indication between the two on the 2027 guide. So we talk about $31 billion combined in 2027. That's our new long term guidance. That is $11 billion for Rinvoq and $20 billion for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is broken down, rheum is about $4.8, dermatology $2.5, IBD $3.7.\nOn the Skyrizi side, 12.5 of that $20 billion guide is from psoriasis and the remaining $7.5 billion is coming from IBD. That might help you kind of see those. Where the growth is coming from as well.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nIf we speak to it in terms of the $4 billion, just to give you a sense, then to add to what Scott just mentioned. So Skyrizi is up $3 billion, $1 billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We're just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD. Then for Rinvoq it's up $1 billion from the previous guidance. And that's a mix of, you know, roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So again, you know, across the board we're seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then your question on how to think about the growth.\nWe have obviously given guidance beyond 27, but as I look at the sell-side consensus, clearly the growth that's in sell-side consensus beyond 27 is below our expectations. We would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in-place share level. The share curve bends. But still you expect to see some level of share growth. And then keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq collectively adding about 2 billion in peak sales.\nAnd so that will also contribute. So as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond 2027, you know, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indication. You'll still see a robust performance from both assets, you know, at least through 2032.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup, your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple, first one on Cerevel, you guys called. About the partial impairment today. The press release just want to get your perspective as to what the drivers are for the remaining value. You know, assuming Tavapadon is mostly it, but wasn't sure what you'd assume for Emraclidine or backup compounds.\nThen just on Aesthetics, you know. With the new guidance to 2029, is it fair to say that you think 25 could be the trough or have we already seen a trough in terms of the growth rate? I'm just trying to think of the longer term picture. And then just on BoNT/E, I wanted to get your perspective about the potential success there, adding new patients to the paradigm, just given the potential there. Thank you.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nJeff, this is Rob on your first question regarding Cerevel. So keep in mind the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can't write that value up. So that would be the same as what we originally ascribed. We still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, you know, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neurodegenerative psychosis. We haven't completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either.\nBut that's a more heavily risk-adjusted opportunity now. So when you think about the value, you have to take into account, you know, the timing, so there's some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy. That's all baked in to because you're essentially valuing risk-adjusted revenues. You have to take that into account. That said, we're, you know, we're still optimistic about the asset. We're pursuing it in these indications.\nAnd again, as I mentioned, we haven't completely given up on monotherapy. That'll depend on dose-ranging, but that is the way we constructed the revaluation of the intangible. But overall, we still see a very nice opportunity, particularly for Tavapadon. And we still see potential for Emraclidine as well.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nJeff, I'll take your question regarding the Aesthetics trough. So we've not specifically guided that, but the way that we have modeled it and think about it is we do see recovery. And I think the big headwind here over the last two years has been the economic conditions. So we do see continual improvement. Carrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we're seeing coming back in the US for both fillers and toxins. So we would, you know, if you model, you would anticipate 2025 to be the trough and then you know, our long term guidance is that high single digit compound annual growth using 2025 as the base year through 2029.\nAnd if you model that, that's going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly this is a business we continue to be excited about. We think that there continues to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we've got some innovation to continue to drive market growth. That market has grown low double digits historically. But I think, as we model, we're thinking a high single-digit growth in the markets. But we do see some growth accelerators with BoNT. And maybe I'll let the team talk about BoNT.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nMaybe I'll just mention here, just more broadly, this is Rob on the business. I think as we reflect on the Aesthetics performance and we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business. But we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup. Again given low penetration rates, high consumer interest, and our leading portfolio including some exciting pipeline programs and toxins and fillers. You know, when you think about as part of AbbVie, the Aesthetics business has been able to continue investing despite the macroeconomic challenges and that will allow us to maximize opportunities when the market does recover. We set up this business to be a global and fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development.\nAnd I'm confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run. It's just been difficult for us to call the market recovery. But we still have a lot of confidence in the long-term outlook.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThis is Carrie. I'll comment on BoNT/E. So as you said, BoNT/E will be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the category. Consideration continues to be very high for Aesthetics and for toxins. And like we said, it continues to be underpenetrated. And that's because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category but not acting around cost, and concerns of an unnatural look. And that's really where BoNT/E will play an important role based on its unique profile that is suited to address these these concerns.\nIt's fast-acting, it has short duration. So it's going to be a nice option to position for these considerers to try BoNT/E and then our commercial strategy will be to convert them from BoNT/E to BOTOX. So this is going to be an important pipeline catalyst to help us to activate that consumer market and drive more consumers into the toxin category for BOTOX.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nAnd it's Roopal, maybe one comment to add to Carrie on the R&D side. Even thinking past that, this year we'll initiate a study with BoNT + BOTOX to cover people immediately and get that long-term benefit. So those studies will start this year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the net impact of the Part D redesign. Can you tell us what the volume impacts you guys are assuming, if any, in that calculation? And then the second question I had is on the pipeline slide you noted you could have some Phase II UC data for NX-13, which I believe is your oral NLRX1 agonist. Just maybe speak to conviction level there and how you think about that on the forward if that would be something that you could move into Phase III. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nTerrence it's Scott. I'll take your question on the volume. So we have guided a 4% net impact across the business for a headwind to growth for Part D redesign. Now when we think about that volume offset, we've not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. I would say in the grand scheme it's a fairly modest offset overall. I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume is recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there's roughly three patient segments and they each take about 1/3 of the business.\nBut this is really something that will impact the standard eligible. And we're working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth. And so we really see that volume offset coming from that 1/3 of the patient segment to drive that. So that's why I think it's a little bit more of a modest offset. But we've not quantified iit.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd it's logical when you think about it because the other 2/3, I mean you have the LIS population which is 1/3. So they don't have an out-of-pocket burden like the standard eligible do. And then the other 1/3 are covered by employer plans where again they don't have the same out-of-pocket burden. So when we analyzed it, we looked at the market and saw that about 1/3, as Scott mentioned, of the population would benefit from the lower out-of-pocket. But keep in mind the cost share applies to the entire book of Medicare business. That's why the volume doesn't offset the price impact.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThis is Roopal, I'll cover the NLRX question. This is our asset from Landos. We had observed very early data, I would say Phase Ib in ulcerative colitis, and that looked good, but it was a very small sample size, I would say. This will be a robust Phase II with a placebo comparator, and we'll get objective data from centralized review of endoscopic data. It will be a good data set to look at, and if it looks good, definitely would be a Phase III asset for us. The other consideration we would have, similar to what I highlighted about other biologics that we'd be combining with Skyrizi, if this looks good, this could be a combination agent with Rinvoq as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I have a question regarding ini. I know you talked in the past about Skyrizi, Rinvoq benefiting from some of the Humira prescription going to these agents as well. Taking that aside. Still, it seems like the volume or INI space is growing rapidly.\nCan you talk a little bit about the underlying dynamics as well here. Why this market continues to grow and how should we think about longer term for the overall market growth itself? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, so thanks Mohit. It's Jeff. And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event in this case, this was the CVS exclusion in April. We could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira. was going to the biosimilar. We saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\nNow we continue to see the molecule compress, and you know, it's just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it's becoming harder to measure because you're also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head to head trials, new indications, and new other approaches. So I would say overall it's there, but it's relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication. So it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market. You'll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress now.\nAlbeit modest. Your other point is very important. These markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. One of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we'll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. It used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you're seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third line markets which are growing quite substantially.\nYou're going to see that significantly emerge in IBD. Whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along. They did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there's drugs like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and other agents, you're seeing those markets, lines of therapy expand. So that should continue and you know, we've contemplated that in our long-term projections. But that gives you some sense of why you're observing what you're seeing.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAs we look across, this is Rob, as we look across the specialty areas in psoriasis and IBD, you know we're projecting high single-digit market growth. Atopic dermatitis in the mid-teens, it's growing very, I mean you're seeing still fairly low penetration rates for atopic dermatitis. So there's tremendous room for growth. So we would anticipate mid-teens market growth there and then in rheumatoid arthritis that's probably more like low- to mid-single digits. But you can see across the board, very nice market growth which then will be complemented by the market share gains.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. So I have two questions please. First, regarding ABBV-400 or Teliso-V, could you please frame your long-term commercial vision for this candidate. Including what some may underappreciate about how broadly it could potentially be adopted in the early 2030s, and then second on external transactions. Emraclidine was a setback, but AbbVie's overall M&A track record has been very successful. Could you please discuss your agenda for M&A, including the potential to leverage your franchise strength and related product categories. Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie",
    "content2": "Yeah hi, it's Jeff. So I will give some thoughts on that. It's a very, very attractive asset. I think it's underappreciated, and part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. If you look at the response rate that we've seen, let's say in a smaller or mid-sized cancer type, which is ovarian cancer, with ELAHERE, it's quite striking. I mean, ELAHERE has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire US oncology market.\nAnd it's because it entered this market, that was basically almost all chemo-based, with unmet need where there'd been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with ABBV-400 or TMAB-A, into colorectal cancer. It's a substantially larger tumor type as is quite evident. We've already seen very, very nice monotherapy result in later lines, much, much better than we've seen with the old chemo standard of care. Really it's whether or not they have c-MET or not. Now the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it's the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, okay.\nThat's really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. You know, the studies will have to bear that out. As well we're seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So it is, I think it's an underappreciated asset. We'll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-MET, the modern c-MET area, but it's quite striking. So first we establish in later lines very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy and then we move combination as we move forward so thanks for the question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nRoopal. Maybe just a comment there on our strategy around ADC and I think 400. It's a good highlight of that. So we think about what's a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, and low expression in healthy tissue. And then we continue to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, and utilizing robust biomarkers as Jeff mentioned, c-MET. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit, risk, and particularly tolerability with our topo warhead platform.\nWe've seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others I think continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical. So we're also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right. So we're able to combine in earlier lines, and that's the same approach that we have with the other one I mentioned, 706, and small cell lung cancer, and others in the pipeline then.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nDavid, this is Rob. I'll take your question on M&A, and thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we've had as a company. I would agree with that. When you think about the transaction with BI, that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics, that brought us IMBRUVICA, and really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers. Then the transaction with Allergan which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company: neuroscience, Aesthetics, and Eye Care. Then more recently the transaction with ImmunoGen which really bolstered our ADC pipeline.\nAs Roopal has highlighted in terms of our go-forward strategy on BD. We continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade. We have clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. So my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade. And since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've signed more than 20 early stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology we've added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard of care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\nYou should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we've added new platforms including multispecifics, trispecifics, T cell engagers, and insight to CAR-T approaches. And then within neuroscience, it's not always appreciated, the work we've been doing in neuroscience. Above and beyond Cerevel, we expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter who discovered VRAYLAR. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh, and we recently acquired a next-generation A beta antibody for Alzheimer's from Aliada. Again, you know, that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth.\nI mentioned neuroscience, Aesthetics, and Eye Care, and, of course, immunology and oncology. These are all large markets with high unmet need. And so, you know, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say, you know, if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need, we would consider pursuing it. Especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade and the company has the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dave. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceuticals Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. I have an observation and two questions. The observation is splitting hairs, but on Part D redesign, the guidance had been a three percentage point headwind. It was just said on the call, four percentage points. A year ago it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please can you identify that?\nRelated to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree? Or is there absolutely none? And then my second question. The company has provided a lot of helpful perspective on the Aesthetics market, but can you distill it to a number?\nThe guidance for Aesthetics was previously greater than nine billion in 2030. What is that number now? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and start with your Part D observation and question. With Part D, we've really, we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn't fully understand sort of the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it. So we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it's evolved a little bit over time. I would say it's evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D but because really the mix of the business.\nSo when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign. We've distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today. Really, when you think about when I came out of that 3%, we've seen momentum in the business, and we've seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology, and oncology in particular, where we raised some guidance where we saw, you know, have high Part D channel mix. So that's really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change. That's really kind of what it amounted to.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, I'll just add, I mean, when you think about the setup for the company in 2025 we said we would return to robust growth and we're delivering in absolute terms, per our guidance, a little bit more than $2.5 billion of growth. That's with headwinds from US Humira erosion around $3 billion, the Part D benefit redesign of approximately $2 billion. When you do the math on the roughly 4% and then a $500 million headwind from the stronger US dollar. So the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq as well as neuroscience. The change you're seeing from, as Scott mentioned, is really more of a mix, a function of mix. But we're very pleased with the underlying growth of the business that's allowed us to absorb these impacts and still deliver robust growth in 2025.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nSteve, it's Jeff. I'll take your second question. So, as we've negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in 2024 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents. So for IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so that's encouraging because again, if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly 3,300, 3,400, it'll sequentially move down more to 2,000 with the smoothing next year.\nWhich is a good policy because it's encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer. Again, the volume will be more modest than the price hit, as Rob and Scott described it. But that's the dynamics that we're seeing in the channels.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nAnd see on your question regarding the Aesthetics guidance, I'll reinforce maybe what I said earlier and Rob as well. So when we look at that guidance, that long term guidance is calling for high single digit CAGR 2025 through 2029. So using 2025 as the base year, if you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single digit range. So that's why we've specifically given the range on the high single digit. The market growth that we've seen historically has been low double digits, but we're seeing that market, we're modeling for now, high single digit growth during the time period that we've given this long term guidance. And so I think that answers your specific questions.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceuticals Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you, a couple of questions please. On Aesthetics, a question I've asked before. What are your expectations for how obesity drugs are going to impact this business? You could argue that the surge in use of products. The GLP-1s could be either a tailwind or a headwind to the use of products like toxins and fillers. It could be a headwind if patients are having to pick and choose between which products to put their out-of-pocket dollars towards.\nAnd then a second question unrelated to the first. PBM reform still being debated in Washington. If AbbVie had its way, what would change about the current relationship between PBMs and drug companies? And what would you argue should be left alone?\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your first question around the obesity market and the Aesthetics opportunity. And you're exactly right. It continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind. A headwind in terms of share of wallet. As these consumers are making decisions on what they're going to spend for.\nWe see that more for the higher price products like fillers, and then also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in Aesthetics. And many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category. So we do see it as both a headwind and a tailwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term. And the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients.\nIt's really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice. And that's what we're doing with our customers now and helping them position BOTOX and JUVÉDERM in our product line for these new patients they're entering their practice.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Tim, this is Rob. I'll take your question on PBM reform. Look, if there are changes to the rebate system, you know, we don't have a strong preference between rebates or discounts. And that's because, you know, we've always competed on the attributes of our products, both the clinical benefit they provide and the value they return to health systems. So we're confident in our ability to compete in either world. I would just point to our share performance in international markets that do not have a rebate based system. And we see similar market shares in those countries as well. So we can compete effectively in either system we don't have a preference.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, thanks. Just a question on atopic derm as a target indication. Just from some of our work, it. Looks like the upside we're seeing in Rinvoq is largely in rheum and gastro. And I know you guys have sort of mentioned this, and it's fairly well known. But in atopic derm, at least from our data, it looks like things are starting to flatten out a little bit.\nAnd I heard your comments on the derm share of Rinvoq revenue in 2027, but that would seem to infer maybe some kind of inflection. So maybe a two-part question here. First, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic and is there an inflection sort of anticipated. And then the second part of that is should we be paying more attention maybe to Lutekizumab or as a contributor here. I know Jeff, you've talked about atopic dermatitis as a very important indication that you guys are targeting or is there some other sort of area like external innovation that you think will augment maybe your position in this indication?\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, it's a very good question. It's an important segment, and to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection. So we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture, and this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So we've ramped to the highest in-place share that we've had, and it was largely flat in the teens for, you know, mid-teens for many, many quarters. And it's ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we've been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints.\nBasically like really minimal disease activity where you're taking itch down to a very, very low level and you're almost completely clearing the skin. And those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform Dupixent. Now having said that, Dupixent still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing. We will see that in patient share start to build into the TRx over time because our TRx share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I'd note is that in many, or if not most of the outside the US markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster. So in several large markets we actually are ahead of Dupixent.\nAnd some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, etc. But we're quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq. This is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now having said that we would and we will continue to look for more assets. Some are in our pipeline as described, but this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in. I don't know Roopal, if you've got any comments on Ludi or some of the other concepts?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThat's right. I mean with the 5% penetration rate there's still many patients that are. SoLutekizumab will be our next one. And as Jeff mentioned, there's other pipeline assets that we're working on and key being skin clearance along with that itch. And if you can get them both and have a safe and tolerable profile, I think that will continue to be competitive.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Thank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. The next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my questions just two from me. So firstly, your sales in Q4, did you see any notable difference in trends in stocking or gross-to-net patterns across the portfolio ahead of the changes in Part D versus previous years? Specifically, I'm interested if you had any meaningful one-offs for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for the quarter, and then circling back on Aesthetics. Thanks for that updated long-term guide. Can you give us a bit more color geographically how we should think about the split between ex-US, China versus the US as you return to growth? Is there an expectation on one coming back quicker than the other? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Scott. I'll talk about the stocking. So we did not see in the past. We've talked about it a couple years ago in particular, but the stocking was relatively minimal in terms of the impact. So we did not see anything with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq on the stocking in Q4 that will be impacted in Q1.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nNo real dynamics here on gross to net either.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nNo, that's right. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I'm sorry, no dynamics around gross to net. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Then with respect to Aesthetics. I don't care if you want.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nSure. For Aesthetics as we think about the long term. We see, like we said, we're planning prudently further economic recovery around key markets like US and China where it's been challenging for the past few years. Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as well. The rest of the world. We see Japan as posting nice growth, as being an underdeveloped market that we're able to invest in.\nAnd then the pipeline catalyst will be important in both US and the rest of the world. Notably, in China in the past year we've had multiple new pipeline catalysts which continue to help drive share for both toxins and fillers last year and this year. Aand we expect the international business to continue to increase as a percent of the revenue for overall Global Allergan Aesthetics.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operato we have time for one final question please.\n\nOperator\n\nSure. Our last question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you very much. When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending? Will there be co-formulation-based approaches? Just trying to understand the potential revenue implications, noting that clearly there could be some clinical benefit that could certainly make sense. And then just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is iCare.\nHow and why does this fit going forward? I understand there's a legacy with the Allergan deal, but just trying to think about the overall portfolio in areas where. You clearly have strengths. But this seems to be one which is noted less than 5% of revenues. What is the role for that on the board? How are you thinking about it? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey Chris, it's Roopal. Maybe I'll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into 23, sorry into 2030. So the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in, particularly, IBD with Skyrizi. And you've heard me mention other combo studies in psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now that we would combine with the multiple assets that we've mentioned over time. TL1A, TREM1, alpha4beta7, IL1 alpha beta, Lutekizumab that we already have.\nThese that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves for all of these assets. We're also looking at biomarker approaches, particularly with Lutekizumab. But we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets and as combinations. The goal would be co-formulation. So, as we enter into the clinical study, we are also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination co-formulation approaches.\nSo that would also be a convenience factor, and we would want to match with longer acting agents. So, for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM1 we're seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation. But we are very competent in making bispecifics. Lutekizumab is one of those.\nSo then in parallel we're making bispecifics that could then also stand alone as single assets. And then as you've heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL23 but we're also working on a TL1A. And what's unique and what we like about that platform, is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that's required and these assets having long half lives. So if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So, multiple steps as we think about immunology.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd then this is Rob, your question on Eye Care. I mean our focus on Eye Care is in glaucoma, retinal disease, and prescription dry eye. We like that business. It participates in a large market with high unmet need that meets that criteria. It has very much a scientific focus an it's a data driven business. It's a very efficient business as well and obviously we're excited about the REGENXBIO gene therapy program focused on wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.\nDepending on how that plays out, I think you could see that as becoming a stronger growth driver. We obviously have four of the five. As you think about, you get a lot of questions there, but we don't get as many questions on Eye Care. But we do believe as you start to get more visibility to this REGENXBIO program. You'll likely spend more time focusing on it. We think of it as a potential to be a long-term growth driver for the company and we like the fit it has for AbbVie.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Chris. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.\nAbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to speak with you today. As AbbVie's new CEO, I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie's promise to our patients, employees, shareholders, and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie's business is performing at or above our expectations.\nWe are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our Ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie's total sales, will outperform our initial full-year sales guidance by more than $1 billion driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology.\nIn addition, US HUMIRA performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters. With biosimilar competition, the strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I'm especially pleased with immunology where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations.\ncontinues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn's disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains, and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. RINVOQ is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications; we are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade.\nIn oncology, ELAHERE has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma.\nIn neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline, and we're excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon.\nLastly, we've been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong momentum of our business.\nAbbVie's results once again exceed our expectations, and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie's top tier long term outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market.\nThese assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture for SKYRIZI. We continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis where total prescription share of the US biologic market has increased to approximately 38%.\nShare is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment where SKYRIZI has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the US biologic market, and for RINVOQ we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis including total prescription share of 10% in the US. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year.\nThe adoption in Crohn's disease has been impressive with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ now achieving a combined market share in the US of more than 40%. SKYRIZI has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn's with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara following our compelling head-to-head study data published last year.\nThis positive trial, which demonstrated SKYRIZI's high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission, has driven a significant inflection in performance, and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis is now underway in the US with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging with SKYRIZI's UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naive patients who have not been exposed to biologics.\nWe also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of RINVOQ in UC where the brand is now achieving a leading in place share in the US internationally. RINVOQ UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the US was in line with our expectations in the quarter, and our guidance contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that HUMIRA will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year.\nMoving now to Oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. VENCLEXTA global sales were $637 million, up 15.8% on an operational basis with strong momentum across CLL and AML. ELAHERE is also performing very well with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data.\nRecent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for EPKINLY in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for EPKINLY's second indication, Follicular Lymphoma in the US, with European approval expected later this year.\nNeuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $774 million, UBRELVY with total revenue of $231 million, and QULIPTA with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis.\nFinally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson's to the US soon. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the momentum across the Therapeutic portfolio and with that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nCarrie, thank you, Jeff. Q2 global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the US, aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance was supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year.\nHowever, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter's inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our US facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader with strong and stable market share internationally.\nSecond quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the US. Economic challenges have impacted JUVÉDERM sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio.\nBased upon JUVÉDERM's relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the US and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near term dynamic, we remain confident in the long term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio.\nGlobal market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options.\nFor example, in China launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic Masseter Muscle Prominence indication, and in the US we will soon launch JUVÉDERM VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing, and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the Platysma Prominence indication by the end of the year.\nPipeline catalysts like these in the key US and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training, and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you Carrie. We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. SKYRIZI is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nSKYRIZI has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe, and well tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, and this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie's leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon.\nEarlier this month we submitted our regulatory applications in the US and Europe for RINVOQ and Giant Cell Arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced phase III results from our SELECT-GCA trial where RINVOQ demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, on disease flare, and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a phase III study for lutikizumab.\nOur anti-IL-1 alpha/beta bispecific in Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating, and there are limited treatment options. In our phase II study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population.\nBased on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the phase III program as the data become available.\nIn the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase II-ready anti-TREM-1 antibody for IBD, and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with SKYRIZI.\nThis follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which as a reminder included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in phase II for UC, a partnership with OSI to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune toleration platform for novel IBD therapies, and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multispecific biologics in immunology and oncology.\nMoving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from our phase II PICCOLO study evaluating ELAHERE as a monotherapy in ER-alpha positive, third-line plus, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. ELAHERE met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8 1/4 months.\nDetailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review Program. Teliso-V has also received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.\nOur submission will be based on the results of our phase II LUMINOSITY study where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in third quarter with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory phase III study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next-generation c-Met ADC which uses a topo payload.\nRecall that we've advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our phase I trial, and we remain on track to begin a phase III study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe're also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small cell lung cancer cohort from our phase I study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and based on the emerging phase I results, we plan to begin a phase II program for 400 in lung cancer.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the US for EPKINLY as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. EPKINLY is now the only T cell engaging bispecific approved in the US to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma.\nWe also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T cell engaging BCMA based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe remain excited about this asset's potential to become a best in class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment.\nIn addition to our phase III monotherapy program, we have an ongoing phase I study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations including with Pomalyst, REVLIMID, and DARZALEX. Based on this work, we will begin phase II combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to Neuroscience, we're in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the US. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951.\nThe CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy, or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device related testing. We're working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we'll provide updates as soon as information becomes available.\nMoving to an update on one of our Alzheimer's disease programs, we recently completed an interim analysis of a phase II study evaluating ABBV-916, our amyloid beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody.\nAs Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our RD organization. The Emraclidine Pivotal Studies in Schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We'll also see data from two additional phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available.\nIn aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face shaping segment.\nA regulatory application is under review in the US for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year, and we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile, and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins.\nSo in summary, we've made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year, and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-HUMIRA growth platform.\nAdjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and 10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 a dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond Q2.\nWe now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase once again driven by our ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications.\nRINVOQ total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. VENCLEXTA total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflects momentum in both US and international markets. For aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the US and China. As a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and JUVÉDERM will each be lower by roughly $100 million.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the Q2 and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D.\nTurning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may occur in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance, and I'm very pleased with the strong momentum across the portfolio heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We'll now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats Rob on the CEO position. Looking forward to the forward here. The question I had is last quarter you guys gave some early commentary on. How to think about 2025. Looking at the business, obviously momentum and immunology. Some headwinds in aesthetics. So, any update on how you're thinking? About the 2025 outlook, particularly growth for revenue relative to EPS? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. This is Scott. I'll handle the question. So with respect to 2025. You know, as you know, we haven't given guidance yet, and we'll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top level, high level.\nhelps to put in context the several dynamics at play. Next year we have indicated that we'll be returning to robust revenue growth despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued HUMIRA erosion. When you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low single digits. When you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024, that we're expecting $5 billion of that is coming from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ alone.\nOur Neuroscience franchise is growing by more than a billion dollars. Aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from SKYRIZI, UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business.\nThen when you think about the offset of HUMIRA, you know, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion. We do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. We feel very, very strong about that. I think from a part D perspective, we've talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth.\nOverall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the top line. Regarding EPS, the bottom line, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we've talked about. So EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We've talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies. And we have a good history of doing that. So that operating margin will expand.\nHowever, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025 we'll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the top line and in line growth from an EPS perspective.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Maybe first on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, great results in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the price versus volume dynamics this quarter? It seemed like results were maybe a little bit stronger than the RX trends would have implied, and I just was wondering if there's anything notable there. My second question was on the immunology portfolio and as we think about 2025.\nI know we're probably in the middle of contracting season right now, but just directionally, what are you anticipating for HUMIRA, and should we be thinking about any incremental pressures on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI just given biosimilar HUMIRA dynamics going forward. Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. I'll take that question. So as noted, we're very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of obviously consumer investments we've made. We've adjusted some of the sales forces. We started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that's helped us basically increase our share of voice.\nAnd I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the HUMIRA switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards SKYRIZI and RINVOQ because the physicians, when there's this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them. And we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms.\nSo while it's a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture. For both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously the contract season is in progress and it's progressing and the negotiations are well underway. I think it's important if you'll recall that we already have some multi-year contracts in place that cover 2025. So that's a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle.\nI would say that, you know, at a macro level we do expect to maintain parity access next year for HUMIRA for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now that said, our HUMIRA access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars.\nWe've understood and planned for this obviously as we enter that third year of the biosimilars. We're well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. Certainly things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multi-year contracts and we'll be in a better position to provide some more information obviously later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Chris, this is Rob, just to reiterate a point, an important point that Jeff made. One trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the HUMIRA molecule to new mechanisms. I mean we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense. Doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn't factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS lives.\nAnd to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for HUMIRA and an upside down upside for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, which is a very good long term trade off for us. That's an important point. We want to make sure that was captured.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rob. And maybe Chris, one more point that I didn't address was the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ contracting. We are anticipating very robust and consistent access for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And. Our former comments around sort of low single digit price erosion should be quite consistent with what we said before. Obviously the Medicare Part D is a separate dynamic, so things are stable and we're anticipating ongoing very strong access for both of those brands.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst of US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and then congrats on the results. I guess. First, just a housekeeping point. I guess in the last call you had talked about earnings growth not being quite at the rate of revenue growth, and it sounds like today you see those more in line.\nAny, I guess, further color on kind of what's driving that. I would assume it's sort of the key ex-HUMIRA drivers, but any other color there would be appreciated. And I guess the more pertinent question maybe on the commentary on Cerevel. Should there be any expectation for divestments or other concessions as we contemplate that deal closing? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, this is Scott. I'll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we're looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we're driving some operating margin expansion, we spend a lot of time focusing on that, and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do see we'll have the ability to leverage that.\nSo there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset, and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So. But that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion. So you can think of those two as essentially netting one another and then driving that earnings growth in line with the top line.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nCarter, this is Rob. I'll take your question on Cerevel. Look, we've made very good progress with the FTC and have certified substantial compliance to their second request. No divestments are expected. I would expect the transaction to close soon, potentially as early as next week. We're obviously very excited about the potential best in class therapies in Cerevel's pipeline, especially in Emraclidine for schizophrenia, Tavapadon for early Parkinson's, and their core antagonist for major depression. I mean, these assets clearly will be great additions to our neuroscience franchise.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to Vamil Divan. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one, if I could just, I guess for Rob, just around sort of your business development priorities. Now you mentioned obviously did a sort of larger deal last year with Cerevel, ImmunoGen; you've done a number of these smaller acquisitions. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of balance between investing for the long term and then sort of balancing the near term earnings growth outlook. I know. So there's a lot of focus on that $11 floor for a long time.\nObviously with all the IPR&D, you sort of dipped a little bit below that for this year, which makes sense. But I'm just trying to think now that we're sort of halfway through the year, how are you thinking about sort of where your priorities are and, you know, the need to kind of balance the near term numbers versus investing for the long term. Thanks.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, yeah, thanks for the question. So you know the $11 floor again was on an ex-IPR&D basis where obviously with this guidance ex-IPR&D I think we're just a little bit over $11.40 and we're certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean we're delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it's very strong. We should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point as we think about the trade-offs for the long term and the short term.\nClearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade.\nAnd you've seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with SKYRIZI or RINVOQ, or be pursued as model therapies. We've also added new platforms including multispecifics that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology, and we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders given our focus in neuroscience.\nSo we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals. Because what we're really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight to top-tier growth this decade, and we want to position the company to deliver strong growth in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. On the aesthetics business. Today has been a day of reporting across the industry. There's some commentary that aligns with what you said. However, some additional questions I have are on granularity about procedure volumes and pricing. Now, in the first quarter you talked. About promotional activities that you pushed towards a seasonally strong second quarter one.\nShould we think about the pricing backdrop as being a component of some of the sluggishness as opposed to purely thinking about or primarily thinking about volume procedures? And if you could sort of respond in the neurotoxin neuromodulator versus the filler segments, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll address the question. So first, let's talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the US for facial injectables. So late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market. And we've seen that market growth recovery continue into this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that's volume, that is traffic into our customers' offices, and that's really been consistent for the past few quarters.\nSo the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although when we think about price, price is a factor that we'll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics.\nWe did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins, and then we will have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won't need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So, really, our performance is driven by market growth, and we have also had some nice stability in our market share. Anything you'd like to add?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nMaybe because it's worth mentioning. So some of that shift in promotional activity that you mentioned, we did talk about in the first quarter that there was a destocking that occurred of inventory levels, and when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis.\nAnd when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the US market, that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and JUVÉDERM.\nSo we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities in the back half of the year with Botox Day and JUVÉDERM Day. We do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pipeline in IBD space as well. I mean you have done a bunch. Of these and then there has been. Some movement, especially in the oral IBD drugs as well. I mean, given your expertise, would love to understand how do you think about? Pipeline moving beyond the likes of SKIRIZI. These IL-17s and all, because these drugs are pretty good.\nBut when you think about an oral. What is the ideal profile of the drug that could be a first-line drug which RINVOQ could not be? And then when you think about combinations. I mean, what are you exactly looking for? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey Mohit, it's Roopal. I can talk about that. With respect to orals. We did do this deal with Landos, and this is our. NX13 asset, which we'll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year, and early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis. This asset works through NF-kappa beta. So you'll see what we've observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma.\nAnd it's potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn't have a boxed warning. So far the safety data has looked good, but there's also opportunities. We believe, as you mentioned, combination that you could still combine with RINVOQ and, as I mentioned, the boxed warning. And in certain geographies RINVOQ has utilized post anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there's still opportunity. The second- and third-line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they're getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs.\nWe'll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-12/23 like Stelara. So in the future there's multiple opportunities, and the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven't been addressed yet and can they complement something like RINVOQ?\nSo if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay. If it's complementary, it may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for combo. And given the other assets that we've talked about that could be IV or sub Q, we still see a lot of opportunity with SKYRIZI, and a platform study and IBD will kick off later this year looking at various combinations.\nMany of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal Alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to SKYRIZI to drive that efficacy even higher because there's still a bit of a ceiling effect, and I would say the unmet need in IBD in particular continues to be quite high.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Just another follow-up on HUMIRA. So Jeff and Rob, just hearing your commentary about how when patients discontinue HUMIRA, a number of them are switching to newer biologics. And I think you gave the 20% number going to newer biologics like SKYRIZI and then also RINVOQ. But we saw some of this happening in the gastro space with one of. The checks we did recently.\nI wonder if you could provide maybe a little more color on this phenomenon. Is there a particular therapeutic silo where this is maybe happening more extensively? Can you give us a sense as to how this has been influenced? Or accelerated by biosimilar availability? Just any more color there Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. It's almost like a bimodal phenomenon. So the 20% I highlighted. So if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of HUMIRA that goes down, down pretty steeply because remember, it's an exclusion. So HUMIRA is no longer widely available at all. So most of it happens within the first two or three weeks.\nAnd in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn't take up all the HUMIRA loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So that's within, let's say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob's point, what he highlighted is if you take a step back and you look at the macro market. We've started to see in Q1 and Q2 that the overall molecule, so that's the Adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before.\nThere was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So it's a doubling of effect acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we're watching this pretty carefully because we obviously haven't seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So that's basically the dynamics that we're seeing. We do think it's because some physicians or segments of physicians.\nThey realize that these biosimilars, where there's an acute interruption, you know, they want to check how the patients are doing. If they're not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let's say before the switch, sometimes they're transitioned at the rates that I described. That's sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like. Well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly HUMIRA has quite robust, let's say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications.\nBut we can see it in rheum, we can see it in derm. Derm to SKYRIZI in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in place share for SKYRIZI and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So to Rob's point, we're going to continue to monitor that if the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And so we'll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over third quarter.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Gary Nachman from Raymond James, please. Go ahead.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nManaging Director of Biopharma and Biotechnology, Raymond James\n\nAll right, great, thanks. Can you talk more about how you're managing the growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in IBD across both UC and Crohn's, which have both been really strong? And with the SKYRIZI UC launch, is there any cannibalization there with RINVOQ? I guess, generally, how do you see those products working synergistically, both in terms of sales force and reimbursement, if you see any sort of issues or conflicts there. Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie",
    "content2": "Yeah, thank you for the question, a very important question in terms of how we commercialize these. Roopal highlighted it. Obviously you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the US but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications.\nAnd it really is, let's say, for example, in our largest market, the US it's relatively easy to execute because what we see is that our representatives can highlight SKYRIZI's data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data, I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the SKYRIZI data.\nAnd then really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, RINVOQ is positioned in later lines. So really that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with SKYRIZI and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal's point, there's still, you know, still pressure on that disease. And then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on RINVOQ in later lines.\nAnd so that's how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It's quite modest. And overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it's quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets. So we're very encouraged about how we've approached the market in terms of our execution and, and I think the results are speaking for themselves.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Regarding the 2024 sales guidance, which I realize is about $55 billion, but it implies similar growth in the second half as in the first half, if not a slight deceleration. Why won't total sales do better? And what were your reservations about raising sales guidance today? Seems that across the business strengths are exceeding challenges. So it would seem not unreasonable to have higher sights. Now, second question is, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on the comment a portion of HUMIRA loss is a portion of HUMIRA loss closest to a quarter, a half, or three quarters of loss? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Scott. I will talk regarding the revenue. So just to clarify, we did raise the revenue guidance in total from $55 billion to $55.5 billion, $500 million raise, and that included a $300 million raise for SKYRIZI, $100 million raise for RINVOQ, $100 million raise for VENCLEXTA, $200 million spread across other products, and then a $200 million reduction in the guidance for aesthetics. So we do see very strong momentum in the business. We did raise our sales guidance from $55 billion to $55.5 billion.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Steve, this is Rob, and if you just look at, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first half of the year, we talked about operational growth around 4%. The implied operational growth in the second half based on our guidance would be slightly above that and really driven by the ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which on a reported basis grew more than 18% this quarter. And so we're very pleased with the performance of the business. And I think when you look at the guidance and you do the math, you'll see that the actual implied second half operational growth is slightly higher than the first half.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nSteve, it's Jeff. To give some sense, we're looking at coming up on the third year of biosimilars. The first way to think about it, in the first year of 2023 we had very strong parity access across all the channels, and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think when we look at all the ins and outs, I think the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks earlier, one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year, and I would think that that range would be around that half point. But again, we're not fully complete with all the dynamics. That gives you some broad, broad spectrum over three years, maybe around the halfway point, ± as we go into 2025.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys, Trung Huynh from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Another aesthetics. Thanks for your comments this year, and you've also moderated your short-term guide accordingly. But you've noticed that the long-term 2029 guide remains intact. So with growth around 4% this year in line with that new guide, I imagine next year will be slightly higher. But then it does imply that growth is well into the double digits for 2027, 2028, and 2029 on calculations.\nJust what here makes you confident about that level of growth later in the decade? And then secondly, just following up on some of your thoughts on the immunology pipeline. You noted the potential of the utility of multispecifics in immunology. You've got a pretty strong bispecific platform. Just what are your thoughts on the data that you're seeing here? Is there anything in development that we should be looking at? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the long-term guidance on aesthetics. So you're right, we've guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we're not changing that guidance. The guidance change, as you noted that I mentioned, is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. You know, we remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there's very low penetration in the markets globally. There's a lot of excitement, excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates.\nI would say when we look at the market growth we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there's additional innovation coming that'll drive that. So we have some of the additional indications of Botox that Roopal walked through as well as the quick-onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very, very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029 strong.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nIt's Roopal. I'll take the next question on the pipeline. So we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it's an IL-1 alpha and importantly also one beta. And this we believe distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular and let's say only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa. And I don't think that was observed as a pure monoclonal.\nAnd the efficacy that we're seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very significant early stage 3, 70%. It was one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination.\nSo we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let's say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy and in particular safety. And we're looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology. And that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Trung. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for. Taking my question and really, really helpful updates today. So, just looking at kind of the.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nCan you just, can you speak up just a little bit? Sorry,\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nCan you guys hear me? All right, does that work?\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nIt's still faint, but we'll do our best.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nAll right, sorry about that. I'll speak very loudly. So when looking at expected growth for VRAYLAR, over the next few quarters, can you comment on what type of impact you think new competitors to the NVD market might have and what you can? Do to help maintain or grow its position going forward?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. We're very pleased with how both of the indications are performing, and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and AMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that VRAYLAR is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, etc. And we've really gone to the very top of the league table for AMDD depression as well. So if we look overall on our demand, we're tracking above 20% in terms of the push.\nWe continue to focus our team and where necessary add share of voice in terms of our sales force. So we're quite comfortable that we can continue to grow our share, which has been growing very, very nicely, particularly on the MBRX side and certainly face the competitive dynamics and navigate those as we go forward.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, maybe to add, it's Roopal here. There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for VRAYLAR is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar, and when you're able to take mania, you don't need an adjunct of therapy for that. So that's a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear, and probably reflected in data, is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we're hearing is with VRAYLAR, patients really don't have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit.\nAnd then the other benefit, I would say, with VRAYLAR is flexible adjustable dosing. So these things together, I think, underlie what Jeff was speaking about.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Evan. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned some of the HUMIRA contracts go into 2025. Does that also apply to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ? And that's what gives you visibility on the low single-digit price erosion. And secondly, has the introduction of co-branded HUMIRA and now that PBMs are more intertwined with biosimilars changed the negotiation dynamics at all? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, so typically, you know, again in some cases we are able to secure, you know, multi-year contracts and as you can imagine that we, we would do that for the portfolio basically the way that our products work. So that does help with the visibility in terms of what our access would look like for 2025 as well as the pricing dynamics. Again, I want to clarify that the negotiating season is not fully complete, but the dynamics are progressing as I highlighted there. So yes to your first question. The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis.\nYou know, I'm not sure that that's actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall. That was, obviously, a volume-related deal with CVS that we announced, you know, over a year ago or almost a year ago now. So it doesn't necessarily play into other negotiations. Each of these payers and pharmacy benefit managers, they have their own ideas in terms of how they want to approach the INI category and certainly. The emergence of the HUMIRA biosimilars. So it's a CVS unique dynamic.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, James. We have time for one final question. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our last question we'll go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to first ask you, do you still feel that your aesthetics business is a good strategic asset for you? And if so, where do you see the synergies within your organization? The second question I wanted to ask you is how you think Pharma will fare under a Democratic versus a Republican presidency and how you're going to navigate through that uncertainty in the near term. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nSo, Louise, this is Rob. I'll take your question. Look, we like the aesthetics business. When you think about the growth profile, the profitability. We have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we've actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We've exceeded our deal model expectations.\nSince we announced the deal, we think it's operating very well. Obviously, we're working through some macroeconomic headwinds, but when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of Daxxify last year, and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we'd see considerable share loss.\nSo, I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period where economic headwinds, we're still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit, and you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, fits the profile we're looking for. So, I certainly feel it's a nice fit for the company as it relates to the acquisition.\nLook, it's hard to handicap it whether it's Democrat or Republican. If you think about, you know, we've obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act, we've come out and said that, you know, even with, you know, modeling that impact in that we still expect to deliver. On our long term outlook.\nNow I will say, you know, our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is, you know, we're certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign since it helps address patient out of pocket burn. But you know, the price setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long term innovation in our industry. So we are hopeful that if it's a new administration or the current administration that they'll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long term patient care in the US.\nI mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome from the legislation. So the way I view it is addressing patient out of pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not. My hope is under either administration that will be reconsidered.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Louise, that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining the AbbVie Q2 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.\nGood morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie's new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie's promise to our patients, employees, shareholders, and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie's business is performing at or above our expectations.\nWe are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid single digit growth in second quarter. Our ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie's total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology.\nIn addition, US HUMIRA performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top tier high single digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade.\nTurning to our results, I'm especially pleased with Immunology where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn's disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains, and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. RINVOQ is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications.\nWe are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, ELAHERE has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma.\nIn neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we're excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon.\nLastly, we've been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year we have executed nearly a dozen early stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong momentum of our business.\nAbbVie's results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie's top-tier long-term outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market.\nThese assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head to head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture for SKYRIZI. We continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the US biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment where SKYRIZI has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the US biologic market.\nFor RINVOQ we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in Atopic Dermatitis including total prescription share of 10% in the US.\nWe are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn's disease has been impressive with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ now achieving a combined in-play share in the US of more than 40%. SKYRIZI has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn's with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year.\nThis positive trial, which demonstrated SKYRIZI's high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission, has driven a significant inflection in performance, and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for SKYRIZI and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the US with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months.\nEarly feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging with SKYRIZI's UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naive patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of RINVOQ in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-class share in the US internationally. RINVOQ UC is now approved in 75 countries with reimbursement and share gaining momentum.\nHaving two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need.\nTurning now to HUMIRA which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the US was in line with our expectations in the quarter, and our guidance contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that HUMIRA will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion.\nIMBRUVICA global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. VENCLEXTA global sales were $637 million, up 15.8% on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. ELAHERE is also performing very well with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data.\nRecent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for EPKINLY in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for EPKINLY's second indication, Follicular Lymphoma in the US with European approval expected later this year.\nNeuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $774 million, UBRELVY with total revenue of $231 million, and QULIPTA with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis.\nFinally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson's to the US soon. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the momentum across the Therapeutic portfolio, and with that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nCarrie, thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the US, aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid single digit percentage versus the prior year.\nHowever, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter's inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our US facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader with strong and stable market share internationally.\nQ2 aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery.\nConsistent with what we experienced in the US, economic challenges have impacted JUVÉDERM sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio. Based upon JUVÉDERM's relatively higher price point.\nLooking to the rest of the year, we expect our market leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the US and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near term dynamic, we remain confident in the long term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio.\nGlobal market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options.\nFor example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic Masseter muscle prominence indication, and in the US we will soon launch JUVÉDERM VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing, and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the Platysma prominence indication by the end of the year.\nPipeline catalysts like these in the key US and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training, and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long term.",

Welcome to the AbbVie Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also in the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, Global Research. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and our regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024, with first-quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective 1 July 2024 and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you've heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession, and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition as our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long term.\nWe are successfully navigating the Humira US loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage, and our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients, will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our Board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years, and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership, and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy, and enhance shareholder value.\nSince our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie, from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan, ImmunoGen, and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company, and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top-tier relative to our peers.\nImportantly, we have substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger, and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance. Rob?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rick. Before I comment on our first-quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance, and demonstrated a genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders, and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong, and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. During the first-quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top- and bottom-line results.\nWe reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta. This broad-based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio, with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline.\nThe integration has been seamless, and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first-in-class treatment for patients, and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvéderm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership and aesthetic fillers. We executed several business development opportunities, adding novel early-stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology.\nGiven the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year, and we are well positioned to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications.\nIn psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market, with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing 1/4 of every new or switching in-play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in-play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan, as well as other key markets around the world.\nAnd finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional Bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In RA, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in-play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations, with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from Level Up, our second head-to-head study in AD.\nLevel Up demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15-milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq's label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15-milligram dose. In IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play patient share in ulcerative colitis, as well as mid-teens in-play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second-line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq in IBD.\nTurning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter, with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full-year outlook for US Humira, and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion, exceeding our expectations.\nImbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis, and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well, and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients, as well as the full label approval, which of course includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum-resistant patients, will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake.\nLastly, the global launch of Epkinli in third-line plus DLBCL is also performing well, and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy, with total revenue of $203 million, and Qulipta, with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease.\nFeedback from the launches in Japan and Europe has been very encouraging, and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q1 global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit %. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvéderm was stable in the first quarter, as these assets remain the clear market leaders.\nWhile we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full-year aesthetic sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million, reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year.\nOur pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Juvéderm Volux and SkinVive products remains strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvéderm Voluma XC for the treatment of Temple Hollows. As the only HA dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. Within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a non-invasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short-acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year.\nThis novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action, as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations, and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit global aesthetics growth this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. I'll start with immunology. We recently announced positive top-line results from two phase 3 studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the Level Up study, which evaluated Rinvoq against Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to Dupixent. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all ranked secondary endpoints in this trial. Level Up was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 mg and could escalate to 30 mg if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses, with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week 2 and on skin lesions as early as week 4.\nRinvoq's safety profile in the Level Up trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the Dupixent group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events, or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data, as well as results from previous phase 3 studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our phase 3 Select Giant Cell Arteritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper.\nIn the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare, and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq, and the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligrams. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the Select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option.\nWe plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a phase two study for Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis, the start of our phase two Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with Lutikizumab and other novel biologics. We remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in Q2 and Europe in the H2 of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in Q1.\nThese include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE Immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions such as IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active multispecific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies.\nThis conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory phase 3 Mirasol trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the phase 2 Piccolo study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR-alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. We expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling phase 2 trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivec, in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now, moving to program updates in hematologic oncology.\nBased on the totality of the data from our Transform One trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting Navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the Transform Two study in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of HEMONC, we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Epkinly in relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma, the phase 3 readout from the Venclexta Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS, and initiation of a phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment.\nMoving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year, our rapid-onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to Botox following experience with this trial toxin. In neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with ABBV-951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the US in Q2.\nAs Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top-line results from their phase three Tempo Three trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In the study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1-hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional phase three studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The Emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our Q1 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance, and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3%, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance, partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions, with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-U.S. growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion. Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%.\nWe now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes US Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a one-time price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year.\nWe are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio, and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress, and congrats to Rob as well. So maybe let's just start with 2024. I mean, so thanks for this guidance. But when we look from 2024-2025, there are a couple of headwinds that you have highlighted in the past.\nSo obviously, IRA Part D redesign would be there, and Humira may have another leg down. And given the volume erosion share, people are a little bit concerned there. Can you help us understand what is your current thinking on the trough 2024 versus 2025? And could you give us some confidence that you can continue to grow in 2025 despite these headwinds from IRA and Humira? Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nSo Mohit, this is Rob. I'll take that question. So if you think about 2024 and 2025, I mean, clearly the ex-Humira growth platform is demonstrating great momentum. If you just think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, are growing by more than $4 billion per year. Aesthetics will recover to high single-digit growth. Our neuroscience franchise will grow by over $1 billion this year on the heels of strong momentum from Vraylar and our migraine portfolio.\nWe will have incremental contributions from Vyalev and Elahere in 2025. So we have several drivers that will offset Humira erosion next year, as well as the Part D benefit redesign impact, and allow us to still deliver robust revenue growth. When you think about that redesign impact, it will really spread across our business, most concentrated in immunology and oncology. We would estimate that that total revenue impact could be worth several points of growth. While we will still deliver robust revenue growth, we will have that headwind in 2025. Keep in mind, for us, the IRA impact really hits us in 2025 and isn't a significant headwind in the years that follow, as products that are subject to negotiation will not have that Part D cost share impact.\nSo the way to think about it is, despite that headwind in 2025, we will still deliver robust growth with that growth rate accelerating in the years that follow. And then if you think about on a margin perspective, we're going to continue to expand operating margins, so that will be a tailwind. You should be, though, modeling annualization of interest expense from these transactions. And keep in mind that we essentially would have, think of it as a roughly half year for Cerevel and 10 and a half months this year for ImmunoGen. So that should be something that you do model for 2025. So we'll have robust revenue growth. We'll have earnings growth, not quite at the rate of the revenue growth because of that annualization impact. But then when you get to 2026 and beyond, you have even faster revenue growth and very robust earnings growth.\nSo that's probably the best way to think about the profile of the company. But when you look at that ex-Humira growth platform, there's a lot of momentum there, and we are very well positioned to deliver very robust growth.\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe I could just ask a couple on the aesthetics side. It sounds like your commentary is pretty generally in line with what you said before, but obviously, the number was a little lighter this quarter than even your guidance and what people were expecting. So can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that? You mentioned some shift in promotional efforts to the second quarter and maybe the inventory levels then as a result being lower.\nMaybe I don't know if you can quantify that a little bit. Was this sort of planned when you gave your guidance back in February, or is this something that sort of evolved over the course of the quarter? Maybe just kind of why the decision was made would be helpful to give us some comfort on the outlook there. Thanks.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. Thanks for the question. So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable for Botox Cosmetic despite a new competitor, strong, stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvéderm line, continued share strength, even some share pickup in the past few quarters as we launch our new products.\nSo like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality, with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. After a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1. We do expect that to come back in Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll let Scott address the rest of that question.\nSure. Thanks, Carrie. So Vamil, to quantify the inventory impact in the first quarter, it was a little bit more than $50 million between Juvéderm and Botox.\nYou can think of that as being split roughly 2/3 to Botox and 1/3 to Juvéderm. I think, as Carrie mentioned in her remarks, that impact of that inventory; we expect that to turn in Q2.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning. When we think about the 2024 upcoming contracting season, which obviously has been quite dynamic for Humira over the past year plus, can you provide us with any insights in terms of structural aspects within your contracts that you build in that may help provide offsets? We often have limited visibility. We're looking at the prescription volume trends, and it feels as if our calculus is sometimes incomplete.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nBut what can you reassure us in terms of the dynamics as we're seeing this year to play out and how you're approaching contracting for the future? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. So the contracting season typically starts April or May, and frankly, as we've highlighted before, can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are we want to continue to basically make sure that patients, if possible, based on our pricing concessions, aren't disrupted. Because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place.\nIn some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, etc. We will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold so they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. So it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work, but suffice it to say that there's terms, timing, and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed, even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques, and that's how we go for it.\nSo again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to 2025, but we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands, and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan, and your line is open.\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just a couple more on the Humira front. I think in Humira, you had mentioned that in 2024, you expected most of the impact would be price versus volume. But I think the street's been concerned that we're seeing more volume erosion, particularly with the CVS book of business. I'm just interested in your latest thinking as we think about price versus volume for the remainder of this year as we consider CVS, Cigna, etc.\nHow should we think about that balance just so there's kind of no surprises as I guess we watch these volume trends playing out? And then maybe just on a related topic, can you talk at all about the tail for Humira sales in the U.S.? I guess the heart of the question, do you expect that you'll see most players or payers eventually switch out Humira like we're seeing at CVS? And if so, is it still reasonable to think about there being kind of a decent tail of revenue, I guess, for this product in the U.S. over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Great, great question. There's a lot in there. Let me go through it in a systematic fashion. So I think first, to directly answer your question, we still, as we look forward, believe that the significant majority of our lives will be at parity.\nSo that means our guidance around the majority being price is still holding in our go-forward look. Let me give you some perspective. I had some in my opening remarks over what's happening with CVS. So the first is that, as I mentioned, the step down in volume was really anticipated. And based on our analysis of the data, which I'll highlight, it's really right in line with our expectations. Now, one of the things in my remarks, I often talk about new-to-brand or in-play share capture. And that's a really good way to look at performance, particularly early in launch cycles when you're looking at capture rate or competitive dynamics. I think it's important that investors and analysts need to be very mindful when you have a dislocation, or disruption, or switching.\nYou can get very, very fooled at looking at NRX or NBRX because it sort of overinflates what you might be looking at. So I think that's important. The other fact base that we look at is, in terms of the step down, we look at other analogs, and we look at the Cosentyx Taltz analog, or Taltz was advantaged in ESI for Cosentyx back in 2019. We see that typically in this category, almost 90% of the erosion tracks within the first two to three weeks. That's actually what we're starting to see, we believe, with the CVS template following that similar pattern. So if you can't really look at NRX or NBRX, you really have to look at TRX in this case, Chris. This is very interesting.\nWe would make sure to guide folks to look at what's happening with the TRX data in the market. What we see is that not all of the Humira prescriptions are moving to a biosimilar. If you look at the first two weeks, it's pretty meaningful. Over 20% of the Humira prescriptions are moving to other mechanisms of action, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In fact, while we haven't studied this week as much, it actually seems to have accelerated a bit from there. That actually makes some sense because if you think of it from the physician's perspective, when patients are being switched, they often take a break and a pause to say, \"Are these patients really under control? Should I consider an alternative?\" That's actually what we see playing out in the market.\nSo the pure degradation or step down from Humira is in line with what we see, but we are seeing a fairly significant move to other mechanisms, as I mentioned, including our own Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And that could be very, very good for patients who are probably getting better care for control of their disease. Now, having said that as well, if we look through the rest of 2024, we have very solid contracts with our payers through 2024. And remember that these payers can add biosimilars at parity whenever they choose. We saw that last year in the middle of the year, and that's really not different now. So when we look at the structure and controls of our existing agreements, we do not see widespread exclusions for the rest of the year as we go forward.\nI think we've been pretty consistent with that, that select clients will move towards biosimilars over the course of the year. Last year, we saw that with Kaiser and Medicaid plans. We've talked about the CVS exclusion for the Humira business. We do see that some select plans may take another approach, which we've contemplated as the year goes on, which is they may move new patients to the biosimilar but maintain the large existing base. That's quite manageable because really only about 14% or 15% of the patients are new patients that cycle into Humira. Overall, that's our perspective. We're confident. Things are tracking in line. We're quite interested in the shift to other mechanisms, which is frankly somewhat anticipated, but maybe operating a little higher than we thought.\nWe still believe that a significant majority of Humira will sit at parity lives in 2024. Oh, the tail. Okay. So the tail, we're going to be negotiating 2025. And what we've highlighted is we are going to watch exactly how the interchangeables play out. We think we've got a good understanding of that. And so it'll probably become more apparent as we move through 2025 where that tail may sit. And we've highlighted that it may start to emerge in 2025 and probably be much more visible by 2026. And that's going to ultimately depend on how, over the course of 2025, the price volume fully plays out in the marketplace.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Chris, this is Rob. On your question regarding the guidance for this year, I think it's important to note, yes, we've said the vast majority of the erosion is price. We've talked about that dynamic.\nIf you think about H1, H2, we have the annualization impact given the mid-year step up in rebates last year. So that annualization impact comes through in the H1. So you'd expect price erosion to be greater in the H1 or the H2. But at the same time, we did contemplate volume erosion because we were very well aware of the CVS contract. We gave you that guidance. And so we have contemplated that volume erosion, but that's more of a H2 versus H1, as well as the potential for we knew with an interchangeable coming in, there could be some marginal amount of volume pickup there. So we did put in volume erosion in our guidance, but the vast majority of it is price. But I don't want investors to think that we didn't put any volume into our guidance.\nWe were very well aware of the CVS contract, and I think we made some prudent assumptions on potentially other impacts. But overall, we're still tracking in line with that guidance.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats, Derek, and best of luck to Rob in the new role. Just wondering if you could maybe frame a little bit for us the opportunity for Skyrizi and UC versus Crohn's disease. I think last time we heard from J&J, Crohn's represented about $7 billion of Stelara sales. Obviously, you guys have made decent inroads there based on your comments, but just wondering how to think about the dollar opportunity and also of colitis.\nAnd then when you were talking through some of the latest Rinvoq data, I was just wondering if there's an opportunity down the road as you generate more clinical data, but also commercial data to potentially revisit the restrictions on line of therapy on the label at some point, or if we shouldn't think about that as a possibility. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Thanks, Terence. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So Crohn's is larger than and then UC. I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%-70%. So Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65-35, 70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means.\nAnd I think I would add, in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had a substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table in terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline. And we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year.\nIt's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category. I'll ask Roopal, based on the safety data he highlighted, to comment on the second question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you. The data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original phase 3s that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients, confirms what we've always seen. That will continue to drive confidence, I think, with our clinicians.\nNow, from a health authority standpoint, I think that the position there is that you have this ORAL Surveillance study with tofacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class, probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that. And that's kind of how we see it. Now, that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling.\nBut now that you know that there's other therapies, you're starting to see people break sooner. So I think that that second and third line is still a huge opportunity and will continue to grow with this emerging data. And Terence, it's Jeff again. One more comment. I mentioned how we're excited about the naive position for both Skyrizi, CD, and UC coming. But what's also nice is those same representatives are in the office and are able to highlight basically a one-two punch where you use Skyrizi first in earlier lines based on this exquisite data, and then obviously for later lines, you can use Rinvoq. And so we actually see in the marketplace that that combination and that positioning is allowing us right now in real time capturing almost towards 40% of all in-play share with Skyrizi first and Rinvoq second.\nSo it's an encouraging position as we fill out that portfolio.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the prior commentary around some of that TRX data. And I guess the overarching question is, is that, I guess, appropriately kind of capturing all the volume you're really seeing? I mean, there's clearly, with your part of your agreement with CVS and the Cordavis there, there is the potential for some Humira volume to potentially be shifting there. Is that being captured by TRX? So I guess any commentary there and sort of the accuracy of that data that we're all seeing.\nAnd then maybe if you just go back and wanted to circle back on the EPS commentary on 2025, sort of the way you frame that growth, is that sort of ex IP R&D? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, it's a great question. So it's early, but we believe the data is accurate. I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira, there was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about 10,000, which was primarily the Cordavis Hyrimoz. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch.\nThese physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients their care path forward. So we think that clearly some are moving to other mechanisms. We've seen that in other analogs as well. We believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early. We're going to continue to monitor it. Where that ultimately lands, we'll have to see. Again, I want to reiterate the pure Humira downdraft is in line with what we assumed, and we are seeing this other market behavior that's taking place.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nCarter, this is Rob. Just to clarify my earlier comments. Yes, it is ex-IP R&D. We always guide to ex-IP R&D. What I was trying to highlight is you should expect robust revenue growth in 2025, and that growth accelerating in 2026 and beyond, given that Part D benefit redesign impact in 2025.\nGiven that operating margin will expand, you typically would expect our earnings to go faster than our revenue. That is generally true with the one exception in 2025 being that we will have an annualization impact from that interest expense. We will still deliver as a very solid earnings growth. But as you model it, just keep in mind that while you'd expect typically earnings to outpace revenue growth given expanding operating margin, you do have that dynamic in 2025 that's important for your modeling.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nResearch Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may.\nJust going back to Humira, but in a slightly broader sense, there's been a degree of political noise around the role of PBMs in blocking or rather than assisting biosimilar uptake. I just wonder if you expect that to come to anything in terms of structural changes within the market. Then secondly, on Rinvoq and the level up data, I wonder how you see the competitive dynamics evolving in that space. Is this about switches or is this about market expansion? I ask because this morning, Sanofi said that they welcome competition as a way of expanding the number of people treated in an area that's still relatively unpenetrated. So I just wonder how you see the opportunity commercially. Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Thank you for the questions. It's Jeff again. I would say that we're not anticipating a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example.\nI mean, we certainly think that there's a very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients. That's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near term. Obviously, we're continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think, as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. So I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean, this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease.\nBut we also think this LEVEL UP study is good for our market share penetration. I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons, we couldn't do that because of the starting dose I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens, in some cases in the low 20s. So the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control. Really, patients, they want no disease on their skin, and they really don't want itch if they can get there. That's what we studied in LEVEL UP.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nSo we think it's certainly going to help with both market expansion and, in particular, around the world with our ability to capture some more share. So I hope that helps.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much. I have questions on contracting for Skyrizi in 2025. How many lives do you already have locked up through your general multi-year contracting? And then do you continue to think that the availability of cheap versions of Humira, either brand or biosimilar, won't lead to any increase in step edits on Skyrizi? Under the idea that while Skyrizi is better, something like Humira or biosimilar Stelara might be just fine, that same argument can be made in the statin category. For example, Crestor is the best. Zocor might do just fine. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nI think we'll probably pass on the number of lives locked up. I mean, we are confident given the market position, Tim, of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I think, in particular, around the momentum that we have across the Skyrizi indications, that we're going to have very favorable access in 2025 and beyond. I think the other thing that we've highlighted is I'm very pleased with how the adoption of Skyrizi is going in IBD. I mean, it's very, very clear that we're taking significant share from Stelara, and the doctors are voting with their pen or their basically electronic prescribing because the ability to get these very sensitive patients under significant control. The world's really never seen anything like this sequence trial in terms of the ability to control the most difficult aspect of this challenging disease.\nSo as time goes by, we think that differentiation is going to aid us significantly as we think about the formulary positions relative to not only Humira, but also to Stelara.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Berenberg\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. It's on Elahere. I wonder whether you might be able to tell us the full quarter of sales and then any commentary around penetration rate of Elahere and how much off-label use you think may be happening with the guideline inclusion. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSure. Thanks, Luisa. It's Scott. With respect to the Elahere full quarter of sales, so we closed mid-year in February. Prior to that, there were, according to what we've seen, approximately, just let me just double-check here, $70 million. I'm sorry. $110 million in the full quarter, $113 million in the full quarter.\nIt's Jeff. What we also see in the marketplace, a big catalyst that we saw in the first quarter, was the movement from the accelerated approval to the full approval that Roopal highlighted with the MIRASOL data. So we were rapidly able to basically integrate that into all the material of the medical liaisons and certainly the account managers and sales folks. And having that definitive table in the label and the ability to go deeper into our call plan is going to be very positive to continue the growth rates through the rest of the year. In terms of off-label, that's difficult to say. We think that the majority of the sales thus far are in that platinum-resistant population. However, the guidelines do allow for reimbursement with different levels of FR-alpha, some of the updates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nSo we'll continue to monitor it, but there's certainly significant headroom in terms of the populations that are coming in terms of the ovarian cancer marketplace.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks. Good morning. When looking at the strong performance of the Neuro franchise of Vraylar and Migraine in particular, talk about the competitive dynamics there in those markets and how did the growth tenets impact you in Q1 versus what you expected, and how should that trend for the rest of the year? And then with respect to Cerevel, just your confidence that it will still close by mid-year and how FTC is viewing the schizophrenia market and how much overlap there might be between Emraclidine and Vraylar, just the latest thinking on that based on your conversations with FTC. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi. It's Jeff. I'll take the competitiveness comment in terms of what we're looking at. We're very pleased with the competitiveness, our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new-to-brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox. If you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec, and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth.\nVraylar continues to perform very well, ongoing market growth. It's really because we have, if we look at our perceptions, Gary, of our key prescribers, you're at the very, very top of the table, the lead table in terms of perceptions around the efficacy around adjunctive major depression, which is our most recent indication, and we have probably the best scope of indications for bipolar I. So both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. We're in a pretty good position. We also feel that the gross to net, our vouchers, our copay, which sometimes can get a little funky in Q1, we have strong controls there, and we're seeing a lot of stability. Overall, those businesses are performing very well.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, I'll take your question. This is Rob. I'll take your question on the FTC.\nWe are working closely with the agency on their additional requests. I mean, keep in mind that we do not have any overlapping MOAs with Cerevel. Vraylar's share in schizophrenia is very low. The vast majority of Vraylar sales comes from the bipolar and MDD indications. In the case of Tavapadon, it will serve the early Parkinson's segment, which Duodopa and Vyalev do not participate in. So we don't have any concerns with the merits of the transaction and continue to expect closing it in the middle of the year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. I apologize in advance for asking you to clarify on Humira, but you mentioned several times that things are playing out as planned.\nBut in the prepared remarks, you said U.S. erosion played out slightly better than you thought in Q1. So is the conclusion that whatever was better is temporary? You also mentioned volume pressure, but offset by price benefit. Can you quantify that? But when you sum it all up, it sounds like you expect volumes to underperform the expectations you set three months ago. And is that in part maybe due to the Accredo news from yesterday? So that's a long question, but that's only one question. The second question is curious if the FDA has contacted AbbVie about the potential safety issues with Emraclidine post the competitor issue with convulsions and rabbits. And have you seen this with your agent? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. So it's Jeff. So I'll try to take that. So the first part was the first quarter.\nI mean, it was marginally better in terms of overall performance because we didn't see, obviously, we didn't see any volume disruption until Q1. Now, when you look at Q1 and we look after three weeks, we look at our model in terms of the expectation around retention of Humira with the CVS formulary, that's largely tracking in line with what our expectations were, with a bit of the surprise that some of that Humira is not going to the biosimilar, as I mentioned, is going to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So overall, as we look to the balance of really the first quarter, what we're seeing play out in the second quarter, and look to the full year, our commentary, and I'll ask Rob to highlight if he has anything to add, is very much in line with what we've guided at the beginning of the year.\nSo no material change in what we're seeing in the marketplace.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nYeah. This is Rob. I'll confirm that, what Jeff is saying. I mean, it's tracking in line with our expectations. We are not saying that volume is worse than we originally guided. We're saying this is tracking in line with our expectations. We've tried to characterize for you the price versus volume dynamics, obviously saying the price erosion is the vast majority of the decline, but there is volume, and it's tracking exactly as we anticipated. So there isn't an additional downside here. And as Jeff mentioned, we did have slightly better performance in Q1, but again, it was, I mean, I think to the tune of $30-$40 million on this book of business, not overly material, but ahead of the initial expectation.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nAnd hey, Steve, it's Roopal. I can take the next question.\nWe did a thorough diligence. When we look at data sets that offer clinical data, obviously, we do a deep dive there. Also look at blinded data, but we also do a deep dive looking at toxicology, animal tox in particular. We didn't observe anything that was consistent with what has been described thus far. As I mentioned, when we look at blinded safety data, either from the 1B or the current pivotals that are running, we don't see an adverse event like this that would be related. As far as we know, no health authority has reached out to ask any further questions about this. Hey, Steve, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your previous question, and maybe I understand where the confusion could be. That one-time price benefit is a year-over-year dynamic. It was contemplated in our guidance.\nWhen you have a formulary change, you essentially have those rebates go away, and you recognize that. That was part of our guidance. That was not a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year. So you look at Scott guided to, I think it was 32% erosion in Q2, which is lower than it was around 40% in Q1. So naturally, you'd wonder why would you have less erosion. Well, there's that year-over-year dynamic, but that was how we planned the year. We anticipated this because we knew about the change that was coming on 1 April. So I don't want you to interpret that as a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year calculation.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Trung Huynh from UBS.\nCongratulations, Rick, on the next chapter of your life and role for moving AbbVie forward. Again, on biosimilar Humira, in your remarks, you mentioned post the expected CVS contract, there was a step up in price for Humira. Is that simply because you were giving away more price for CVS at the contract at the time? And you mentioned additional contracts moving to biosimilar like CVS this year. Are there any meaningful contracts here that you can flag so we're not surprised? And is it possible we could see actually a pricing increase by year-end because of this? Thanks very much.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nTrung, this is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the price benefit. So in my remarks, I indicated that with the formulary change in CVS and the volume step down we saw there, that there's a one-time price benefit associated with that.\nAnd you can think of this as we have the volume declines, that volume had been associated with price that we would have been paying in terms of rebate. Those rebates will no longer be paid. Therefore, there's a one-time price benefit associated with that initial step down in the quarter. So that's what that relates to. Yeah. And in terms of what we see going forward, as I highlighted, we don't see a significant exclusionary action where Humira would be removed from a formulary going forward. We did plan for, obviously, that smaller plans may make some adjustments to their formularies. That's all within the volume degradation and the pricing dynamics that we put into our guidance.\nAnd as I mentioned in one of the comments, some of the payers, not super large, would maybe consider this idea of starting new patients on the biosimilars versus maintaining all the existing patients on Humira. So if you were to see that, you shouldn't be surprised about that. And that would be within the contemplated approaches that we're taking as we look across Q2 2024 with our knowledge of what's happening in the marketplace.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. And our final question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the aesthetics business, maybe talk to me about some of the dynamics you're seeing in China. I know that there's a lot of macro headwinds, and this is a pretty big part of your business.\nThen a bit of housekeeping on Skyrizi: last quarter, you disclosed a $1.9 billion cash payment for royalties. Can you provide us any color on what this quarter's royalty was? And I believe that was for the full year-last-year, but maybe just for this quarter. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi. This is Carrie. I'll address your question on aesthetics in China. And we do expect economic headwinds that we're seeing in China to persist over the near term, with the China aesthetics market flat overall for 2024. So the way to think about it is to expect negative market until the recovery starts to begin in the second half of 2024. China does remain a very important market for our aesthetics business.\nAnd as the market there starts to recover, we will continue to invest in consumer activation, injector training, and continue to launch new products in this important market.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nHi. It's Scott. So you're right. With respect to the Skyrizi royalty payments, so you have to remember that these are on a bit of a lag, so they don't track each quarter sales. But the $400 million was the amount in the first quarter that we paid in cash payment.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nWell, thanks, Evan. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024, with first-quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective 1 July 2024 and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you've heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThe Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession, and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition as our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long term. We are successfully navigating the Humira US loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority, and competitive advantage, and our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients, will continue to fuel our robust pipeline.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business, excluding HUMIRA, which delivered full-year sales growth of more than 8% with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter.\nThe strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but has also supported continued investment in our business for long-term growth. These investments include higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be raised substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 and multiple myeloma 400.\nOur next generation ADC for several solid tumor types and Lutikizumab for HS as well as inflammatory bowel disease, the proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with a pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend, which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%.\nIn summary, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US HUMIRA loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations.\nAs it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex-HUMIRA growth platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio we have several key brands including SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY, and QULIPTA, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly underpenetrated market.\nSecond, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for SKYRIZI in UC, 951 in the US, and potentially accelerated approval for EPKINLY in third-line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for Bonti, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nAnd third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year.\nToday we are also reaffirming our long term sales outlook which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024. We now anticipate SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027, with robust growth continuing into the next decade.\nThis updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for SKYRIZI to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis, where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. We expect RINVOQ to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of RINVOQ's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for RINVOQ, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars.\nOur updated forecast also includes higher estimates for UBRELVY and QULIPTA. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long term forecast for aesthetics, VRAYLAR, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. SKYRIZI total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. RINVOQ total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8% on a full year basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year over year. As Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in play share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share. Just today, for example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's disease.\nThese two treatments together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for RINVOQ, and we anticipate launching SKYRIZI for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, SKYRIZI is capturing roughly half of the in-play psoriasis patients in the US biologics market relative to a total prescription share which is in the mid-30s%. RINVOQ is capturing high-teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market while total share is in the high-single digits.\nSimilarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, RINVOQ is capturing mid-teens in patient share while total share is roughly 7%. So again we see substantial headroom for share gains. In addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro, plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for RINVOQ across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the US we have once again secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year over year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of US patient lives.\nTurning now to Oncology where total revenues were $1.5 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for EPKINLY and third-line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe, and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add ELAHERE to our portfolio. ELAHERE is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the US market.\nI look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie and Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors.\nIn neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago, and our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both UBRELVY and QULIPTA this year, including the expansion of QULIPTA, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum.\nWe have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from UBRELVY and QULIPTA combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the US later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.\nSo overall I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. With that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\nCarrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter US Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the US facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants.\nUS JUVÉDERM sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of VOLUX and SKINVIVE, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the US filler market recovery trails that of toxins but is continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our US aesthetics portfolio. We expect full-year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets.\nInternationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions, and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results, consistent with what we experienced in the US. The economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions.\nLooking to the long term, aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration, and we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. In 2023 we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive top line results for Lutikizumab, our anti IL1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase II study, Lutikizumab demonstrated higher high score 50 and high score 75 measures as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients were inadequate responders to anti TNF therapy and 70% of the patients were Hurley Stage 3, which is the most advanced stage of the disease.\nBased on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III program in HS later this year. We also plan to evaluate Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. In these diseases, patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNFs and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe Lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with Lutikizumab and SKYRIZI as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase II studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year.\nOur regulatory applications are under review for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once SKYRIZI is approved in UC along with RINVOQ, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well positioned with an industry leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nWe continue to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for RINVOQ, with Phase III studies underway and five new indications: giant cell arteritis, lupus, HS, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year.\nMoving to oncology where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase III Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS patients with regulatory submissions and approvals anticipated in 2025 for EPKINLY. We anticipate regulatory approvals in third line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase III studies in 2024, including studies in second line DLBCL, and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH meeting we presented new data for our BCMA x CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma.\nABBV-383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low-affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell-engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe're very encouraged by the data emerging from our phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep, durable responses with a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma while potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment, all attributes which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase III monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year, and we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 Luminosity study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.\nTeliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval and we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months pending alignment with the FDA. Our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400 which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V but has a proprietary Topo 1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index.\nWe remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer, and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study, and based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase III study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase II study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase II studies this year, including front-line HCC, front-line lung cancer, and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in Q2. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development.\n951 delivers significant improvements in off time and on time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa, and it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox and platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year, and we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for Bonti, our rapid-onset short-acting novel toxin.\nFollowing completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organizations once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthen our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex HUMIRA growth platform.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales.\nAdjusted net interest expense was $363 million. The adjusted tax rate was 17.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note, this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year.\nWe expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth at current rates. We expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including HUMIRA sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%, SKYRIZI revenue of $10.5 billion reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market share performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD, and RINVOQ sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40%. With continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications on a full year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will be modestly offset by low single-digit negative net price.\nIn oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion as well as contributions from EPKINLY, and partial year sales from ELAHERE. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid single digit revenue growth from JUVÉDERM. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion representing growth of more than 15% including VRAYLAR sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion, and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions.\nWe forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023.\nTurning to Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $1.9 billion and RINVOQ revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality, as well as low single-digit unfavorable net price. We expect HUMIRA global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion.\nWe also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and 2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support.\nA strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just looking for a little bit more color on the longer term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. I guess my question was just, can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications for these products are going to be by 2027 and what type of growth can we anticipate longer term? And maybe as part of that, it seems like from the comments that the growth beyond $27 billion is more skewed towards RINVOQ given the new indications, but just getting a sense of, like, is it balanced RINVOQ and SKYRIZI or has it become more of a RINVOQ driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your question, so we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the biopenetration of these big indications, and there still remains significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to.\nBe exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals. Absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis, still even in the US, is about 15%. It's relatively modest atopic dermatitis. The penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD. And I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD that's somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those, and then we can see clearly as these markets developed, and I've highlighted this before, that you see line of therapy expansion. So you know, first line becomes less and less important as you move towards second and third line over time. And right now IBD is a big story about that that we calculate into our long-term estimates because it's still largely, despite the severity, a frontline oriented market because physicians just kind of hang on to their frontline agents.\nThat's going to change quite dramatically. We believe over this midterm and even in the long term perspective, we have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable, and will have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around biopenetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share. We have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates, and we're really in the sort of the low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share that will build up and catch up to that pricing. I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing, but certainly you can see based on Scott's comments that the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we contemplated.\nSo we believe that there's significant room for growth even past 27.\nEspecially as we'll have more RINVOQ indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nChris, this is Rob. I'll just add, think about the markets. The rheum market is growing low single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens, and IBD is growing high single digits. So these are very strong markets. They will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into the early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct given that we would expect up to five new indications for RINVOQ. If you look at the rate of growth RINVOQ vs. SKYRIZI, I think it's reasonable to assume that RINVOQ would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications. But both will grow very nicely.\nSo I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies, which were in book a little bit higher because of the new indications.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing. We've been fielding that question from number of investors recently. Given you're now past the HUMIRA LOE and position the company very well here given SKYRIZI and RINVOQ commercial success and also some of the recent pipeline build out. And then the second question I have is on a pipeline on Lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this. Not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS and then why you're confident that that Phase II HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAll right, Terence, this is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, you know, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make this transition. That criteria is the same when we believe that we are comfortable. We've navigated the LOE and the rest of the business is performing at a high level. That's the point which we want to make the transition because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here. That's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use.\nIn order to make the decision with the board, I would say the board's been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making at the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before. At the next regularly scheduled board meeting, I would make a recommendation to the board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors.\nWhat you can expect when you get that announcement is that we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four to six months in the future. The purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. That will take four or five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the board, that I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time. The purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time.\nSo, I think it's a very well-thought-out, I think, very well-managed process, and I think that's what you can expect going forward.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nTerence, this is Jeff. I'll start off and have Roopal address the second part of your second question. So, you know, we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of HUMIRA, and we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There's a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS. It's already a multi-billion dollar category, and we think it's going to continue to expand. I say that because we can see that, like, like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So everyone sort of holds on HUMIRA as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. So we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into the space.\nAnd certainly we're very excited about Lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge.\nIn the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the HUMIRA indications over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to a billion-dollar-plus business. So it's an exciting opportunity both commercially, and certainly for patients. Roopal can address your comment on IBD.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, Terence. You know, part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with HUMIRA. As Jeff was discussing where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS, we saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with IL-1 beta. So we think we have that opportunity with Lutikizumab because it also covers IL-1 beta. And we have two shots at this. Right? One is to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression.\nThe other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like SKYRIZI which has high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's, what we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. A biomarker approach and a combo approach are insights from HUMIRA and preclinical or.\nBiopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nHead of Global Healthcare and Managing Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, many thanks.\ncouple of questions. One, given AbbVie's strength in market access and managed markets, I'd be curious the extent of future contagion from the IRA mediated price cuts on the Medicare book spilling over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is given the payers are basically the same? And then second question on Lutikizumab, if I remember from the Canakinumab trials secondary to neutropenia there was an increase in fatal infections. If you're laying this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Andrew, thanks for your question. It's Jeff. And we think that the, particularly the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. And as you can imagine with government programs over the years when we have discussion with payers, you know, they'll often say things over, well we know what the FSS price is for the VA or you know, the mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll talk about Lutikizumab and your question around neutrophils. Yeah, we do see an impact on neutrophils. It's dose driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit risk. Because today in those disease states, despite the success that we've seen with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy. Not every patient is getting into remission though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose, we've seen very little infections.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Reasearch, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move?\nThe drug into.\nEarly lines of ovarian cancer?\nYou talked about maintenance setting, but more.\nWe are reading it.\nI mean, in first-line maintenance, the PFS and OS tends to be really long.\nCould you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do?\nYou overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide?\nThank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi Mohit, it's Roopal. I'll take that. So I think as you've seen in resistance, we've seen the overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also.\nPart of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population; resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is we've seen encouraging data in medium expressors of FR Alpha, and those are approximately 30% of the patients; high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple things, insights that we've seen. One is we've seen ELAHERE been able to combine at full dose with carboplatin. So that's encouraging. That gives you an opportunity to up front combine and then, as you stated, maintain on ELAHERE or with ELAHERE plus Bev. So the other approaches that we would do getting the earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy, and then we see patients that go on to Bev.\nWe can combine with Bev at that time point and we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors which is about the other half of the patient populations which are HRD deficient. So taken all together, we see there's an opportunity. Now the PFS is going to be a little bit longer along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for. We'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, this is Dan Crouzet on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on HUMIRA. I was curious, given the recent performance the company has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on HUMIRA's longer term tail revenues in both the US and ex-US markets. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US the tail will start to emerge in the 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands and ultimately what does contracting look like next year. So I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year, but it's certainly possible something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing I think this year a step down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico. We're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas.\nSo not really specific to biosimilars. And then, you know, the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ as these newer agents elevate standard of care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so probably the best way to think about international would be, you know, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific. I think we need to see, really, how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Research Analyst and US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio, I guess first on ABBV-951. How should we think about that? Is that more sort of around growing the overall pie of device aided therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and the gels, and then maybe looking a little bit longer term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase II Alzheimer's studies that are going to read out later this year, by early next year, fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about.\nThese assets either individually or collectively and your level of excitement? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medications. So oral Sinemet, ok. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals and sometimes at the end of it they're taking, you know, 12 pills a day. Very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief. You either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery, or our own Duopa, which is a GI surgery.\nSo the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone because you don't have, you know, it's a sub Q so a new market segment that starts to emerge before, you know, bigger interventions like DBS or Duopa, and obviously the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan where we launched late last year, and also in Germany in some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing, titration, and the pump is much smaller.\nAnd again it's a sub Q injection that you move around every three days. It's a nice opportunity for the company.\n\nRoopal Thakkar",
    "content2": "Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nAnd maybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimer's first 916. That's our a beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, that the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing, potentially higher potency, if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we're looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say end of this year, early next year, I think that that would be quite exciting because it would be a differentiated profile, again, a better convenience and potentially better benefit risk profile. So that's 916, 552 is our SV2A, that's.\nOur oral medication in cognition that's currently in phase two. We anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now that one is being studied in a setting where a patient can be on a therapy already like an Aricept or on nothing. We would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others, including other neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimer's. The third one I'll mention is around Imraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. The goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis. Of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis.\nSo with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimer's. Because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this, but more to come, end of this year and into next year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from.\nYour line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given? You included them in the 2024 guide and you upped SKYRIZI and RINVOQ by $6 billion, Migraine by $1 billion. If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, you know, high single digits. When you think about the range that could represent, you know, that's around $10 billion, you know, between the low end of the high single digits and the high end of the high single digits. And so there aren't any pulls. What we've updated as we walked you through it is we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, and we've reaffirmed the other. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter. About $3 billion in 2029.\nIt's nice to see that upward movement, but it's still below what we expect. If you think that growth rate for the street is just under 5%, we expect high single digits. And so even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high single digits. But keep in mind it's a pretty wide range and it would be regardless industry leading growth. And we're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nSenior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\nFirst, on aesthetics, could you talk?\nBit more, why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024? So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth? And what are other regions? Will you be getting somewhat of a lift this year? Just talk about the dynamics on that front.\nOh, and then secondly, just, you know, as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025? You know, can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll take your first question on aesthetics and the aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover at the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue and for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers in the US, in Q4 after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest, positive growth for 2024.\nAs we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here in terms of China. We do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near term with China. We expect the China aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in H1 2024 until the China market starts to recover in H2 2024. We expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for aesthetics, and areas of Latin America like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market.\nIt's also important to note in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there, that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year over year comp in Q1 because recall in Q1 of 2023 there was the post pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in the US, China, and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Rob to build on the aesthetic story I said in the past. To get to our guidance of greater than nine billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high single digits on average. As Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year, and we will, but it's not going to be a normal year. We'll see a ramping, and we also have a slowdown in China. But despite that, we're still delivering high single digit growth. Given how underpenetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. Then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few hundred million dollars each.\nOur novel short-acting toxin Bonti has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our regenerative fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be relatively steady over several years. I would, though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions in ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full year at that point in time. But at a full year impact, we see that expansion.\nI do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin, and certainly with the future expansion, we'll continue to have that and only grow that position.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US? So it represents the high water mark for the foreseeable future. Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate and we're pretty much there. So I'm wondering if the increases are kind of behind us. And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear obvious reasons such as the success of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the HUMIRA patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting, formulary, management, allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve. This is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we're essentially flat, between this year and last year, 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three-year period, including this year, increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase, the GILTI rate in particular will increase. So we see that over a three-year period, about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these OECD minimum taxes and other things.\nI would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week the House passed a tax bill that includes a provision regarding the R&D expensing. If that bill were to pass as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate, about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believe would allow us to be able to offset the HUMIRA LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective, and we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets?\nI think, AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional, in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand.\nThe patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by.\nAccess to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things, I think, to end up with the kind of success that we see with assets like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But it also takes, I think, a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on RINVOQ was a great example. But look at where RINVOQ is growing now.\nDespite that label change many would not have predicted. Migraine was a very challenging market for a period of time. Look at how we've operated with UBRELVY and QULIPTA and the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with VRAYLAR. That's all about trying to grow market share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so we're good at that. And I think that is the other thing I'd say is I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry, but we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now, having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D.\nAs I said in my comments, we did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the HUMIRA LOE, and we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we have some assets that have very, very significant opportunities, like 383, like 400, and several others that are going to require large Phase III, multiple large Phase III studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need. That's another thing I'd say we're good at, understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there's one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie as an executive team, and we execute very well against those.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Evan Segerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, guys.\nMalcolm on for Evan. I wanted to.\nAsk, thinking about the upcoming approval for.\nSKYRIZI in UC, how is management thinking about how that may or may not impact RINVOQ sales? Obviously, combined, AbbVie offers an impressive suite of inflammatory assets.\nWhat is the expectation of cannibalism?\nAcross these assets potentially? Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. You know, we've learned a lot from watching SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's. And to Rick's point, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know, how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see, certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they're actually complementary positioning. So Rick highlighted the label change.\nRight.\nSo RINVOQ in the US is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later line therapy. SKYRIZI. If you look at the SKYRIZI UC results, it's very, very impressive. We studied some very, very tough patients there, the bio-naive patients. The efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for SKYRIZI frontline and then in later lines RINVOQ. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well, just as we see in the larger Crohn's market.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks for the question. Operator. Next call. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, I have a question on obesity.\nDrug impact on AbbVie's aesthetics business. So the uptake of obesity drugs could be a headwind or a tailwind. It's a potential headwind if patients only have so many dollars to spend on aesthetics and they reallocate their out-of-pocket spending away from dermal fillers and toxins towards obesity drugs. Or it's a tailwind if patients using.\nObesity drugs get things like the so.\nCalled Ozempic face and they end up using more toxins than fillers. So what's been the experience thus far, and what do you expect going forward over the next handful of years?\nThank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. So the short answer is we have not seen an impact on our aesthetics business, positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long term tailwind. Anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really what we've learned is that it does reinforce this long term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight loss products are more interested in aesthetics afterwards than they were before.\nSo that's really how we see it in terms of that dynamic impacting aesthetics. Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nTim Lugo\n\nPartner and Group Head of Biotechnology Equity Research, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking the question. After the two announced acquisitions in December, what are the team's thoughts on M&A in 2024? Some of your peers have given guidance on expected deal sizes. Is that something you can provide the street or at least talk about your capacity at this point?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi Tim, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care. We have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early stage opportunities which are typically smaller sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, just think about immunology. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard of care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination in oncology. ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs.\nIt gives us a head start by buying an entry in the solid tumor space that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecifics, multispecifics, immuno-oncology agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying in situ CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage, smaller-size deals in neuroscience. Several add depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration in eye care. We're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program and wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there, and then in aesthetics. It's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our provider's practice. So our BD group is still very active.\nWe certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities to further bolster our pipeline. But those are the areas that we're most interested in.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I have a question on biosimilars and more competitive with Cadherin-6. How do you feel about Cadherin-6 and FR alpha ADCs interacting, and how do you feel about that market landscape.\nLooks going forward.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nYou know, unfortunately your line is not very clear. Can you maybe try to repeat the question one time?\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nSorry about that.\nAre we hearing better now?\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nIt's still a little echoey, a little bit better, but go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay.\nI was asking about Cadherin-6 and the competitive dynamics in ovarian cancer.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nYeah, unfortunately, it's just not coming through clearly. Happy to address the question following the call. Apologies for that, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much and congrats on.\nThe long-term updates.\nSo with respect to the Alzheimer's commentary.\nA product was left out, the TREM2-AL002, which has an estimated primary completion in September. If you could comment on that as well, that would be helpful. And then with respect to the GILTI.\nTax change that's coming, could you please provide some more color on that, including the timing and the potential impact? Thanks very much.\n\nTom Hudson\n\nSenior Vice President, and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Tom Hudson. I'll answer the question. The first question. Yes, we do have a partner program with Alector on the TREM2 target. TREM2 was identified in Alzheimer's disease through genetic studies several years ago. Very strong link. We have a program to modulate a neuroinflammatory response in AD. All patients are enrolled in the Phase II. We won't have data later this year. So again, it's an early clinical development, but we will expect to see key data later.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSure.\nThis is Scott regarding the GILTI tax. So this is the US tax, the foreign minimum tax on foreign earnings that the US supplies. That tax rate today is at 10.5%. It's going to move up to 13.1%. A little bit more than that. That will occur. The implementation date's a little bit mixed because it depends on fiscal year ends of legal entities. But let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that. And only part of our income is subject to that rate. So I would say that's approximately a 1.5% impact to our tax rate that you would see. And that's baked into my 1% on average over the next three years.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, final question is Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the Part D restructure and IRA. So you have a number of drugs that are likely to be impacted by this, and obviously you talk about your strong rebound in 2025. So I'd just love to hear your thoughts on how that restructure will impact and to what extent that is already baked into your expectations of the rebound. And maybe just to check, have you now received the initial offer from CMS on IMBRUVICA? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thank you Luisa. It's Jeff. You know we have contemplated in our planning and long term guidance both the Part D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated to give you some color on the Part D redesign. We have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place. As you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and spread. We've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that that's been very much contemplated into that.\nI'll let Rob comment over how that sort of feeds into the growth rates.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nLuisa, you ask a very good question. This is Rob, you know, clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single-digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about, you know, the annual progression, it is important to note that Part D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean that impact by itself on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, it's a higher cost share with an offset in volume. We have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part D, which doesn't have the out-of-pocket burden that the standard benefit does.\nWhen we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part D, but not enough to fully offset the higher cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. As you think about the progression of growth, you know, the rate of growth will accelerate, you know, starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high single digit CAGR. It's important to note that in 2025 you do have that beginning of Part D benefit redesign which adds, I'd say a couple points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't, you know, you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year. It's going to accelerate over the long.\nRange plan.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd then this is Rick on the IMBRUVICA price. Yes, we have received the initial offer on IMBRUVICA recently. As you know, there's a process that CMS is going through here to set pricing.\nBecause none of us have any experience with this, we don't know exactly how that process will proceed. There will be some back and forth between the manufacturer and CMS. CMS has indicated that they'll have the final price by 1 September.\nIt's certainly premature for us to talk about the price now because it's not the final price. I don't know that we'll know the final price until very close to the point at which they are prepared to publish that price, having not had any experience here. So I wouldn't anticipate we would get any updates until either that date or very close to that date.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Luisa. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you.\nThat concludes today.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nSam.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSam.\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only into the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, Global Research. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. In addition to the news release issued this morning, we have also posted slides on our website at investors.abbvie.com that supplement some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding HUMIRA, which delivered full-year sales growth of more than 8% with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the Fourth Quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but has also supported continued investment in our business for long-term growth.\nThese investments include higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be raised substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, ABBV-400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types, and Lutikizumab for HS as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with a pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend, which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%.\nIn summary, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024. Including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US HUMIRA loss of exclusivity driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nRob, thank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations.\nAs it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex-HUMIRA growth platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY, and QULIPTA which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year. Driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly underpenetrated market.\nSecond, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for SKYRIZI in UC, 951 in the US, and potentially accelerated approval for EPKINLY in third-line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nAnd third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year.\nToday we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024. We now anticipate SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade.\nThis updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for SKYRIZI to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader as well as strong uptake in IBD, and we expect RINVOQ to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of RINVOQ's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for RINVOQ, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars.\nOur updated forecast also includes higher estimates for UBRELVY and QULIPTA. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecast for aesthetics, VRAYLAR, and 951 remains unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio, and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. SKYRIZI total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. RINVOQ total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full year basis, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year over year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in play share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share. Just today, for example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's disease.\nThese two treatments together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for RINVOQ, and we anticipate launching SKYRIZI for this indication later this year, so significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, SKYRIZI is capturing roughly 1/2 of the in-play psoriasis patients in the US biologic market relative to a total prescription share which is in the mid-30s%. RINVOQ is capturing high teens% in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market while total share is in the high single digits%.\nSimilarly in rheumatoid arthritis RINVOQ is capturing mid-teens in patient share while total share is roughly 7%. So again we see substantial headroom for share gains. In addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro, plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for RINVOQ across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the US we have once again secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA in 2024.\nWhile there will be some step down in coverage year over year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of US patient lives.\nTurning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $903 million, down 19%, reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7%, on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for EPKINLY in third-line plus DLBCL have been encouraging, with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe, and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add ELAHERE to our portfolio. ELAHERE is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the US market.\nI look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie and Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors.\nIn neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full-year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago, and our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both UBRELVY and QULIPTA this year, including the expansion of QULIPTA, the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, into the international markets.\nBased on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from UBRELVY and QULIPTA combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. Lastly, we recently launched ABBV-951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the US later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced patients, Parkinson's disease, and a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.\nSo overall I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. With that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\nCarrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Fourth Quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth Quarter US Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the US facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants.\nUS JUVÉDERM sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of VOLUX and SKINVIVE, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the US Filler market recovery trails out of toxins but is continuing to show improvement as year over year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our US aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets.\nInternationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions, and growth benefited from the impact of China's post-COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results consistent with what we experienced in the US. The economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long term, aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration, and we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation.\nAs such, we anticipate aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie",
    "content3": "Thank you, Carrie. In 2023 we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive top line results for Lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1 alpha/beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase II study, Lutikizumab demonstrated higher HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 measures as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy and 70% of the patients were Hurley Stage 3, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III program in HS later this year.\nWe also plan to evaluate Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNFs and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe Lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with Lutikizumab and SKYRIZI, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase II studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year.\nOur regulatory applications are under review for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once SKYRIZI is approved in UC along with RINVOQ, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well positioned with an industry leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nWe continue to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for RINVOQ with Phase III studies underway in five new indications: giant cell arteritis, lupus, HS, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year.\nMoving to oncology where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase III Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS patients with regulatory submissions and approvals anticipated in 2025 for EPKINLY. We anticipate regulatory approvals in third line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase III studies in 2024 including studies in second line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma.\nAt the recent ASH meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA x CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T cell engaging BCMA based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1B study, which show treatment with ABBV-383 is yielding deep and durable responses with a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple multiple myeloma while potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment, all attributes which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase III monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year, and we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 Luminosity study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.\nTeliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval and we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months pending alignment with the FDA. Our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V but has a proprietary Topo 1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index.\nWe remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer, and gastroesophageal cohorts from our phase one study, and based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a phase three study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase II study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase II studies this year, including front-line HCC, front-line lung cancer, and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in Q2. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development.\n951 delivers significant improvements in off time on time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa, and it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US. Once approved in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox and Platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year, and we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for Bonti, our rapid-onset, short-acting novel toxin.\nFollowing completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organizations once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthen our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-HUMIRA growth platform.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales.\nAdjusted net interest expense was $363 million. The adjusted tax rate was 17.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and 11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year.\nWe expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth at current rates. We expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including HUMIRA sales of $9.6 billion including US erosion of roughly 36%, SKYRIZI revenue of $10.5 billion reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market share performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD, and RINVOQ sales of $5.5 billion reflecting growth of nearly 40%. With continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications.\nOn a full year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will be modestly offset by low single digit negative net price.\nIn oncology we expect sales of $5.7 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.9 billion and then Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion as well as contributions from EPKINLY and partial year sales from ELAHERE. For aesthetics we expect sales of $5.7 billion including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid single digit revenue growth from JUVÉDERM. For Neuroscience we expect revenue of $8.9 billion representing growth of more than 15% including VRAYLAR sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care we expect sales of $2.2 billion.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023.\nTurning to Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for key therapeutic areas, immunology sales of $5.1 billion.\nIncluding SKYRIZI sales of $1.9 billion and RINVOQ revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical Q1 seasonality as well as low single-digit unfavorable net price. We expect HUMIRA global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion.\nWe also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and 2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully.\nSupport.\nA strong and growing dividend which we have increased by more than 285% since inception. Continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThanks so much for the questions.\nJust looking for a little bit more color on the longer term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. I guess my question was just can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications these products are going to be by 2027 and what type of growth can we anticipate longer term?\nMaybe as part of that it.\nSeems like from the comments that the growth beyond 27 is more skewed towards RINVOQ given the new indications, but just getting a sense of like is it balanced RINVOQ and SKYRIZI or has it become more of a RINVOQ driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your question so we can see, historically, actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications, and there still remains significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to.\nBe exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals. Absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis, still even in the US, is about 15%. It's relatively modest. Atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD. And I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD that's somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets developed, and I've highlighted this before, that you see line of therapy expansion. So you know, first line becomes less and less important as you move towards second and third line over time. And right now IBD is a big story about that that we calculate into our long-term estimates because it's still largely, despite the severity, a frontline oriented market because physicians just kind of hang on to their frontline agents.\nThat's going to change quite dramatically, I believe, over this midterm. Even in the long term perspective, we have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable, and will have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around biopenetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share. We have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates, and we're really in the sort of the low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share that will feed up and catch up to that pricing.\nI think we talked a little bit, we're not going to give detailed pricing but certainly you can see based on Scott's comments that, you know, the idea of a high single-digit CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we'd contemplated. So we believe that there's significant room for growth even past 27, especially as we'll have more RINVOQ indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nChris, this is Rob. I'll just add, you know, think about the markets. The rheum market is growing low single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens, and IBD is growing high single digits. So these, they're very strong markets. They will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into the early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct given that we would expect up to five new indications for RINVOQ. If you look at the rate of growth RINVOQ versus SKYRIZI, I think it's reasonable to assume that RINVOQ would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications. But both will grow very nicely.\nSo I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with RINVOQ a little bit higher because of the new indications.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing. We've been fielding that question from a number of investors recently. Given you're now past the HUMIRA LOE and position the company very well here given SKYRIZI and RINVOQ commercial and also some of the recent pipeline build out. And then the second question I have on a pipeline on Lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this. Not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS and then why you're confident that that Phase II HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAll right, Terence, this is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is I have nothing new to report today. But what I'd indicate is we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make this transition. That criteria is the same when we believe that we are comfortable. We've navigated the LOE and the rest of the business is performing at a high level. That's the point which we want to make the transition because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here. That's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use.\nIn order to make the decision with the board, I would say the board's been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making at the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before. At the next regularly scheduled board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors.\nWhat you can expect when you get that announcement is that we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future. In all likelihood, four to six months in the future. The purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. That will take four or five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the board, is that I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time. The purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time.\nSo, I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process, and I think that's what you can expect going forward.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nTerence, this is Jeff. I'll start off and have Roopal address the second part of your second part. So, you know, we established, you know, many years ago now this HS market with the approval of HUMIRA, and we thought it was a relatively small market and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There's a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS. It's already a multi-billion-dollar category and we think it's going to continue to expand. I say that because we can see that, like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on HUMIRA as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into the space.\nCertainly we're very excited about Lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge.\nIn the clinic. It's a significant commercial opportunity. I would say that when we look back over all the HUMIRA indications over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to a $1 billion-plus business. It's an exciting opportunity both commercially and certainly for patients. Roopal can address your comment on IBD?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Hi, Terence. You know, part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with HUMIRA. As Jeff was discussing where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS, we saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with IL-1 beta. So we think we have that opportunity with Lutikizumab because it also covers IL-1 beta. And we have two shots at this. Right. One is to go specifically and look at a biomarker driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression.\nAnd the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like SKYRIZI, which has high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. So a biomarker approach and a combo approach are insights from HUMIRA and preclinical or.\nBiopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nHead of Global Healthcare and Managing Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, many thanks.\nA couple of questions. One given in market access and managed markets. I'd be curious the extent of future contagion from HUMIRA IRA mediated price cuts on the Medicare book, spilling over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is given the payers are basically the same.\nAnd then second question on Lutikizumab, if.\nI remember from the Canakinumab trial, secondary to neutropenia, there was an increase in fatal infections. If you're laying this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Andrew, thanks for your question. It's Jeff. We think that, particularly, the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. As you can imagine, you know, with government programs over the years, when we have discussion with payers, you know, they'll often say things over, well, we know what the FSS price is for the VA or you know, the mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. So we see that the market, we believe, will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. That's how we view the world.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll talk about Lutikizumab and your question around neutrophils. Yeah, we do see an impact on neutrophils. It's dose driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit risk. Because today in those disease states, despite the success that we've seen with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy. Not every patient is getting into remission, though, high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is, what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose, we've seen very little infections.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Reasearch, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move?\nELAHERE into early lines of ovarian cancer?\nYou talked about maintenance setting, but more.\nWe are reading it.\nI mean, in first line maintenance the PFS and OS tends to be really long.\nCould you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do?\nYou overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide?\nThank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi Mohit, it's Roopal. I'll take that. So I think as you've seen in resistance, we've seen the overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far and to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also.\nPart of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population. Resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is we've seen encouraging data in medium expressors of FR Alpha, and those are approximately 30% of the patients. High is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple things insights that we've seen. One is we've seen ELAHERE been able to combine at full dose with carboplatin. So that's encouraging. That gives you an opportunity to up front combine and then as you stated maintain on ELAHERE or with ELAHERE plus Bev. So the other approaches that we would do getting the earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go on to Bev.\nWe can combine with BEV at that time point, and we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken all together, we see there's an opportunity. Now the PFS is going to be a little bit longer along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for. We'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, this is Dan Crouzet on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on HUMIRA. I was curious given the recent performance of companies has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on HUMIRA's longer term tail revenues in both the US and ex US markets. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US the tail will start to emerge in the 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands and ultimately what does contracting look like next year. So I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year, but it's certainly possible something we would do either in 2025 or 2026 as it relates to international. You're seeing I think this year a step down of about $400 million.\nHalf of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico. We're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then.\nThe other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. As these newer agents elevate standard of care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so probably the best way to think about international would be if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific. I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dan. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Research Analyst and US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio. I guess first on 951, how should we think about that? Is that more sort of around growing the overall pie of device-aided therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and gels? And then maybe looking a little bit longer term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase II Alzheimer's studies that are going to read out later this year, by early next year, fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about.\nThese assets, either individually or collectively, and your level of excitement? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medications, so oral Sinemet. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals. And sometimes at the end of it, they're taking 12 pills a day. Very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief. You either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery, or our own Duopa, which is a GI surgery.\nSo the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone because you don't have. It's a sub Q. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before.\nBigger interventions like DBS or Duopa and obviously the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany in some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing, titration, and the pump is much smaller. And again, it's a sub Q injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice opportunity for the company.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nMaybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimer's first, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far is that the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing, potentially higher potency, if that holds. And we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we're looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say end of this year, early next year, I think that that would be quite exciting because it would be a differentiated profile, again, a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916, 552 is our SV2A, that's.\nOur oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase II. We anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now that one is being studied in a setting where a patient can be on a therapy already like an Aricept or on nothing. We would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others, including other neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimer's. The third one I'll mention is around Imraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. The goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis.\nOf the 6 million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis, so with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimer's because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this, but more to come end of this year and into next year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from.\nYour line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given you included them in the 2024 guide and you upped SKYRIZI and RINVOQ by $6 billion, migraine by $1 billion? If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, you know, high single digits. When you think about the range that could represent, you know, that's around $10 billion, you know, between the low end of the high single digits and the high end of the high single digits. And so there aren't any pulls. What we've updated as we walked you through it is we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, and we've reaffirmed the other. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty wide range. If you look at street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029.\nIt's nice to see that upward movement, but it's still below what we expect. If you think that growth rate for the street is just under 5%, we expect high single digits. So even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high single digits. But keep in mind it's a pretty wide range, and it would be regardless, industry-leading growth. We're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth, and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nSenior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks and good morning.\nFirst, on aesthetics, could you talk?\nbit more on why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024. So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth? And what are other regions? Will you be getting some sort of a lift this year? Just talk about the dynamics on that front.\nOh, and then secondly, just as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025? Can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll take your first question on aesthetics and the aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US, and we have started to see the US toxin market recover at the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue, and for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers in the US in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here.\nIn terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near term with China, and we expect the China aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. We expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions including Japan, which has become an important market for aesthetics, and areas of Latin America like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market.\nIt's also important to note, in terms of Q1 2024 in terms of our guidance there, that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds but also a difficult year-over-year comp increase in Q1, because recall in Q1 2023 there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in the US, China, and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Rob to build on the aesthetic story. I've said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high single digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year and we will, but it's not going to be a normal year. We'll see a ramping and we also have a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how underpenetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that we have several innovations that will further support that growth.\nI've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few hundred million dollars each. Our novel short acting toxin Bonti has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our regenerative fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand and will continue expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's what will hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions, ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full year at that point time. But at a full year impact, we see that expansion.\nI do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin, and certainly with the future expansion, we'll continue to have that and only grow that position.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US so it represents the high water mark for the foreseeable future? Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate and we're pretty much there. So I'm wondering if the increases are kind of behind us. And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear obvious reasons such as the success of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the HUMIRA patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting, formulary, management, and allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve.\nThis is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we are essentially flat from between this year and last year at 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three year period, including this year, increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase, the GILTI rate in particular will increase. So we see that over a three year period, about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD, and some of these OECD minimum taxes, and other things.\nI would say the one thing it does not include. You saw just this week the House passed a tax bill that includes a provision regarding the R&D expensing. So if that bill were to pass as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believe would allow us to be able to offset the HUMIRA LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective, and we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so we, as an executive team, focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets?\nYou know, I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional, in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand.\nThe patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by.\nAccess to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things, I think, to end up with the kind of success that we see with assets like SKYRIZI, RINVOQ. But it also takes, I think, a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on RINVOQ was a great example, but look at where RINVOQ is growing now.\nDespite that label change, many would not have predicted that migraine was a very challenging market for a period of time. Look at how we've operated with UBRELVY and QULIPTA and the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets.\nNeuroscience, very different kind of market with VRAYLAR, that's all about trying to grow market share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so we're good at that. And I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry, but we produce a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now, having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D.\nAs I said in my comments, we did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the HUMIRA LOE, and we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we have some assets that have very, very significant opportunities, like 383 and like 400, and several others that are going to require large Phase III more."

Welcome to the AbbVie Q4 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\n\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the US biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We've been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price. Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics, continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double-digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.\n\nWe anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox, will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next-generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel IO in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for full-year earnings, which Rob will share momentarily.\n\nIn further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nThank you, Rick. Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong, with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best-in-category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027, with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance, with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the US toxin market.\n\nThis outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and 11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the Q4 call.\n\nFinally, today we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR to the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rob. We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year.\n\nThis performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs. Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly 1/3 of the total prescriptions in the US biologic market and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the US dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease, where we are capturing roughly 1/4 of in-play patients.\n\nImportantly, we recently announced positive results from Sequence, the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Sequence is a phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best-in-category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data, as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full-year sales outlook for Skyrizi.\n\nMoving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I'm very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the US second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. In Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our timeline launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full-year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US.\n\nplayed out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better than expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. In Imbruvica, global revenues were $908 million, down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The US launch of Epkinli in third-line plus DLBCL is also tracking well, with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth.\n\nGlobal sales of $751 million were up 35.4%, and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65% as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe, branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications.\n\nSo overall, I'm extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q3 global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year, as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. US Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the US toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the Q3 following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. US\n\nJuvederm sales were $116 million in Q3, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year, as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however. As a higher-priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins, this segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In Q3, the US facial filler market was down low teens % compared to the prior year. Juvederm remains the market-leading facial filler in the US, and share was stable in the quarter. While the US facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the US as we end this year and enter 2024.\n\nInternationally, Q3 aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in Q3 of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching SkinVive in the US, and in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin, BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust ALI technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the US market to help our customers acquire, retain, and cross-sell more aesthetics patients.\n\nOur strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers, combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration, will position us for strong growth going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThank you, Carrie. In immunology, we had two important milestones in Q3 for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis, we submitted our regulatory applications for Skyrizi in this indication in the US and Europe, with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the Sequence head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48, with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara, and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.\n\nFurthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Skyrizi versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data, combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year, will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe, and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well. In addition to the ongoing phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus, and HS, we recently began the phase 3 program for Rinvoq in alopecia areata. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24, demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.\n\nImportantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study, illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to phase 3 in this indication, with studies expected to begin soon. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for epcoritamab, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.\n\nIn our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top-line results for the phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to pomalidomide in relapsed refractory patients with a t(11;14) mutation. In the study, the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS was longer with Venclexta versus pomalidomide, but did not meet statistical significance. The Venclexta combination also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to pomalidomide. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data shows a benefit with the Venclexta combination, and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available. Beyond Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline.\n\nWe continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABV-383, where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results, as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next generation BCL-2 inhibitor ABV-453, which is currently in Phase 1 studies, and we'll provide updates as the data become available. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top-line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence.\n\nSimilar to results from the first phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met, with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neck bands. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the US near the end of the year. In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top-line results from two phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid-onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect.\n\nPatients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as eight hours following injection and a duration of effect of two to three weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including phase two data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase two proof of concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody lutikizumab in hidradenitis suppurativa.\n\nRegulatory approval in Europe for ABV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the US near the end of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nThank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the momentum of our business. The strong performance we are demonstrating from our immunology Growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. Starting with our Q3 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our immunology Growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales.\n\nNet interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full-year sales increase of $300 million, roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full-year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.\n\nMoving to the P&L, we continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IPR&D occurred through the third quarter. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine months of the year.\n\nOur cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with a dividend payment in February 2024. We remain on track to achieve, by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results, and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Liz.\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.\n\nYes. Our first question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning. The 2024 earnings guidance, it seemed as if you were quite confident heading in that $11 floor. As we await further details from top-line and other margin structures, can you maybe identify some of the key push pulls that actually gave you that conviction to go to $11 and where directionally we should be thinking about the source of further growth on the forward? Thank you.\n\nHi, Chris. It's Rob. I'll take that question. So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave the $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough occurred in 2023 or 2024. We've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience, and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq ramp very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications. Both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast, and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear overperformance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D.\n\nWe hope this provides investors with a view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that 2024 will indeed be the trough year. Given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from 2024 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple.\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding aesthetics. So it seems like you are keeping the guidance here. So the first part of the question is, it seems like across the board there is a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline on all the products. Can you help us understand what's happening sequentially? And then if you are keeping the guidance, it seems like there would be quite a bump in Q4. So how should we think about that?\n\nMaybe I'll start. This is Rob. I'll start with your question. So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the stocking that occurred in the prior year. So that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the US in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the US toxin market. Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there.\n\nI'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. We've studied this market historically. We do tend to see a lag, and that's really relative to, if you think about, the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. So from that standpoint, we feel very good.\n\nThen as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you, I'm sure, have been watching very carefully, we saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. That's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business. It's growing nicely. As I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. I'm not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for ±$100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. That's something to keep in mind. But as we look at the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. If you think about the US.\n\nneurotoxins market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens, and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits. Market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts through our promotional efforts. Something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. I mean, you think about the masseter and platysma indications for Botox. Those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin, BoNT/E, has the potential to activate new patients. That could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients, it is fear of an unnatural look.\n\nThe short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. Then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. As I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we launched, both SkinVive and Volux. With this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure, but over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that greater than $9 billion expectation for 2029.\n\nMohit, this is Rick. The other thing, if you're looking at it sequentially, you have to keep in mind is we do Botox Therapeutic in the Q4. So that elevates revenue in the Q4, and that occurs every year. So if you're looking at Q3 to Q4 and trying to understand why is there a big step up, part of that step up is that.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just maybe a two-parter really focused on immunology for 2024. So maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I guess with more of the 2024 formulary discussions complete, we're seeing some great volume trends. But are you still comfortable that we should expect more normalized price erosion for those two products versus the high single digits we're seeing this year? And then the second one was on Humira for 2024. I think, Rob, you might have commented last quarter on your comfort with where consensus sits. And again, maybe similar question with maybe more color about formulary for next year. Is that something you're still comfortable? And just how should we think about dynamics there? Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thank you, Chris and Shea. I'll take the first question. Yeah, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean, if you think about all the indications that we've had, seven over the last 18 months. I highlighted in my remarks nine head-to-head trials. We're just in a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into 2024 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember the background there were those seven indications that came very fast, all on top of each other.\n\nAnd so that was the root cause of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not seven, and that's Skyrizi UC that Tom highlighted. So we'll see the normalized price erosion more in line with industry norms versus what we saw this year.\n\nAnd then, Chris, this is Rob on Humira. I think if you think about the annualization rebates that, given the rebates that increased in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact and the additional rebates to secure preferred access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in 2024. I mean, volume will have an impact, particularly in WAC-sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving 2024 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average. It was about $7 billion when I mentioned that, was a reasonable expectation for US Humira next year. Now, there are a few analysts who have forecasted US Humira above $8 billion next year, which is just not a reasonable expectation given the price dynamic.\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Obviously, you guys are very well positioned coming out of the Humira LOE in terms of the growth franchise, but I think there's also a focus from investors on maybe bolstering the pipeline. So as you guys think about M&A and business development, maybe you could just walk us through your latest thoughts and anything in terms of therapeutic areas of interest and stage of development. Thank you.\n\nOkay. Terence, this is Rick. I'll cover that question for you. Yeah, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing, and I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single digit going forward from 2025 going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector who need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position.\n\nSo I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the '30s. That's what the bulk of our focus is on. I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. I'd say for the most part, we have done a pretty good job. When we acquire assets and bring them in, we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool in how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises.\n\nOur primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example. I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms, in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology, and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like LUDI, like RIPK-1, and several others in our pipeline. But we're continuing to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which obviously perform exceptionally well. So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area.\n\nWe have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T-cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indications, T-cell engagers can be extremely effective. And they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients than CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level of interest. In psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety, mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction.\n\nIt's a value-enhancing asset for the company. When we find them, we will act on them, and we will act on them quickly.\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question. This is Alice Nettleton. I'm for Tim Anderson. A question on obesity and its interface with immunology and a lot of other drug categories, frankly. Are you aware that payers have to cover obesity medicines? And if that's correct, it's a big expense, and payers will be looking for offsets. One offset would be for payers to squeeze other therapeutic areas as hard as they can. An example could be immunology, where there's now a really good product, your own Humira, at a much lower price. So we're wondering how much payers might start to force a step edit for products like Skyrizi. It's a relevant question because yesterday, one of the issues Bristol noted with its Sotyktu product is step edits, and they cite biosimilar Humira as the reason. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Hi. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff. And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was one of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's nine of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira, versus the leading IL-17 Cosentyx, versus the oral Otezla. And we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there. And that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that.\n\nIf you think about your comments that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic. I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Rinvoq, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not.\n\nThanks, Alice. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOur next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I'm in transit right now. But the two questions I have, actually, one is maybe building on Terence's question around business development boost in the pipeline. I think we get a lot of other questions just around sort of maybe underappreciated assets within your pipeline. So I don't know if you can maybe just comment on that and if there's a couple of assets that you point out that you think people are overlooking or there might be some underappreciated upside. And then the second one is just on this charge you took today or this quarter on Imbruvica regarding the Medicare drug pricing program. And obviously, I understand why you did it. I'm curious on the amount and the timing.\n\nSo why did you do it now as opposed to maybe waiting to see how the lawsuits play out or the negotiation process plays out? And then in terms of the amount or how, what your assumptions were, as much as you can share, obviously, there's competitive dynamics here, too, but sort of what you're assuming around the impact that this program would have on the pricing of Imbruvica and doing a derisking thinking.\n\nAll right, Bombal, this is Rick. I'll take the first question, and then Scott will take the second question. So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. And a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way. And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear, the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate.\n\nIn fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running-rate basis will be larger than Humira to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now that I think we have a high level of confidence in. ABV-400, our Topo Warhead platform with our c-Met version of that. We're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward.\n\nLater, sort of the 2027, 2028 kinds of timeframe, I think is when it will have meaningful benefit playthrough. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy, and very good safety and very convenient dosing. We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would also say 916 and some of our TAO programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well.\n\nThe third program I'd talk about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program. And that could be a nice opportunity for us as well. And it continues to advance well. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through 2024 and into 2025 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those. Bansal, this is Scott with respect to your question on the Imbruvica charge. So I think a couple of things.\n\nAs we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if Imbruvica were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happening. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors.\n\nBut really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flows. So as we calculated the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, we discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on 1 February in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate, at least an initial thought on price. But it won't be finalized until 1 September of next year.\n\nWe will see what that price is as the process plays out.\n\nThanks, Bombal. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nThank you very much. I have two questions and one clarification. First, the clarification is the base year for the high single-digit revenue growth to the end of the decade: is the base year 2023 or, excuse me, 2024 or 2025? I think it's 2025, but maybe you can clarify that. Second, given AbbVie's stated interest in building the oncology business, I assume that AbbVie took a hard look at the ADC deal that Merck signed with Daiichi. I'm just curious what about it didn't you like? Was it the profile of the products? Was it the price? Or do you feel you have everything you need already? And then the last question is, at least one other company has changed its tax rate guidance stemming from a recent IRS document clarifying Section 174 tax legislation. Do you have any perspective on this update and why it doesn't impact AbbVie?\n\nThank you.\n\nSteve, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. The base year is 2024. If you think about it, we signaled that we expect to return a robust growth in 2025. That high single-digit CAGR really would pick up that first year of robust growth of 2025. If you start in 2025, you'd miss that year of growth. Our intention has always been 2024 is a base year, and that high single-digit CAGR starts from 2024 to the end of the decade. Okay. Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the second question. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on whether we looked at that same transaction. That probably wouldn't be appropriate. What I can tell you is we knew it was there. Maybe that gives you some idea of our perspective on it.\n\nBut the reality is, we believe we have what we need with 400. We believe that platform, and we own that platform. We developed it internally. It gives us everything that we need in that area. And so, it wasn't something that we were looking at. And Scott?\n\nYeah. Hey, it's Scott. So with respect to the tax legislation, I certainly can talk about what our facts are. But when we've looked at, certainly, this results out of tax reform legislation a few years ago, the tax rules, there's always a little bit of uncertainty. And what happened this quarter, there was guidance that came out that I would say clarified a certain approach and treatment. Prior to that guidance, though, there was a little bit of a diversity of opinion amongst advisors and ourselves as to how we might implement. So I would tell you that we were already implementing consistent with how that guidance ultimately came out. And that's why you're not seeing any impact to us on our tax rate.\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nNext question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. So first, back to the trough raise in 2024, how are you thinking about spending levels for both SG&A and R&D into the trough year next year to set up for growth in 2025 and beyond? And do you have a better sense of where the operating margin might end up next year? And then secondly, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have been doing very well in the IBD indications. Talk about how much headroom you see for those products and you see in Crohn's with that landscape likely getting more competitive in the coming years. And any updated thoughts on 2025 guidance for those products? Thank you.\n\nHi, Gary. It's Scott. I'll start with your question regarding operating margin. So when we've looked at the operating margins we've talked about in the past, for 2023 and 2024, we had talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margins that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really in that 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5%. We would expect operating margin in 2024 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. Then I think as a result, roughly the gross margin is going to be in line in 2024 with what we're seeing this year as well as the expense profile. So very consistent with this year. Of course, we'll refine that when we come out with guidance.",
    "content2": "Yeah. And this is Jeff. I'll highlight your comment on the headspace and IBD. I mean, the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Crohn's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that, unlike what you might think, that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually, physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients.\n\nIt puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets, for example, in the US, Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market, that gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component. In most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share, even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong.\n\nSo lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market. We believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nGary, this is Rob. On your question regarding the 2025 guide, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, particularly in IBD. If you recall, last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025. It was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. Those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance. We'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guide. But clearly, the momentum is there. The street reflects that too. I mean, if I look at consensus now for Skyrizi, I think it's around $11 billion. So it's $1 billion higher than our 2025 guide. So I think the market's recognizing the strong momentum.\n\nWe'll update that long-term guide holistically at the appropriate time.\n\nNext question, please.\n\nNext question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nHi, there. Thank you for taking my question. To continue with IBD, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the AbbVie pipeline emerging behind Skyrizi and Rinvoq and how we think about that and maybe potential combinations with Skyrizi. With a recent competitor launch in psoriasis with a label where the FDA has asked for mention of TNF safety warnings, I wondered whether the FDA has mentioned anything to you about the review of label in that regard. Thank you.\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll take the IBD question. So you've heard already some mention of lutikizumab. That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with an IL-1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we'll also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned. For example, with Skyrizi, we have lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK-1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have. GLP-2 is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment.\n\nAnd we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy, or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go with a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now, moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation, if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23, very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all, nor do we have any of that in our label.\n\nAs we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe. Our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with a new one in the IL-17 class. And also, we've talked a lot about IBD. Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also, with our dosing regimen, you get it at zero in week four, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's five doses that are required, then potentially every eight weeks or in heavier patients every four weeks. So we're very confident in Skyrizi's position across indications, especially in psoriasis.\n\nThanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.\n\nNext question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nYes. Thanks very much. So I'll expand upon your vision for oncology. Clearly, the company has compelling assets. But in light of an increasingly complex and competitive oncology landscape, could you just paint a picture of how you see your portfolio evolving and opportunities to acquire assets when it may be difficult to see what's around the corner from, let's say, an emerging oncology competitor in three to four years? Thanks very much.\n\nHi, this is Tom Hudson. We've been sort of, when we talk about ABV-400, we're also talking about going to a different space than lung and breast where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors. And that's why we've developed this with Topo Warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing the very good data with the ABV-400. Even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments in GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea. And one of the things that excited the clinicians about this program is actually the very low rate of diarrhea.\n\nSo it makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines, and combine with other therapies, and have a higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year in CRC. We'll have different doses. And we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So we're moving very well. But to actually in a big space in GI tumors, as I mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met's also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need, and the competition is not the same.\n\nNow, the other targets, because we talked about Topo platform, we have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with CEST-6. Next year, we'll be going to two other indications for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space. So our strategy is actually to go and bring this as an offering to a lot more cancer patients. I'll start there. I'll stop there. Oh, and then maybe in Heme? Roopal.\n\nIt's Roopal. Thank you. Let me add on a little bit. I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out. I will mention lung a little bit. We still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But one approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly. That was observed at ESMO.\n\nThe other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy either in the front line or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost. That's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients, when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well.\n\nWe have a plan to get into phase 3 in that next year. Then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. One of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. With CRS, we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2. So that enables a potential where you may not need hospitalization. What you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization, but a REMS. What we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile. We're moving into phase 3 with that one. We continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma.\n\nWe are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with Epkinli in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL-2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic. So quite a comprehensive approach across oncology.\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Jeff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nHi, guys. Morning. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple of quick ones. One on immunology. So do you guys have evaluated the impact from Humira biosimilars beyond even 25? Is it your view that tail revenues are likely to be better than you initially modeled? And what, if anything, do Stelara, the delay in Stelara biosimilars, impact this? And the second question, just on capital deployment, you've just given your higher guidance. I know you guys just raised the dividend, but would you also say that the deal capacity is higher? I know you recently raised kind of an M&A range and wondering if that's even going higher. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Hi, it's Jeff. It's Jeff here. We continue to study the tail. I mean, it's something that we look very closely at. We continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in 2025 or 2026. That's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move. I mean, the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule-like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a subsegment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume. But it'll be there, even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in 2023, that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. Again, we're still highlighting that.\n\nIn terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the US that will not come until, and I think it was recently confirmed this week, until sometime in 2025. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted. So hope that helps. And Jeff, this is Rob. You're right. We did lift the cap. We had put that $2 billion BD cap in place while we were rapidly paying down debt. And we lifted that at the beginning of this year because we essentially, by the end of this year, we're going to have paid off all the incremental financing from the Allergan transaction.\n\nAs Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8 times. I have said previously that as long as we have a path back to two times net leverage in two to three years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. As we look at it, there's nothing from a balance sheet capacity standpoint that would limit us today from pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. That's not a limiting factor. To the extent that we continue to raise guidance and perform more strongly, that just means there's even more capacity. But at this point, that's not a rate limiter for the types of opportunities we'd be interested in.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for the question and congrats on the progress. So I just wanted to touch on the dividend growth. So at first glance, it seems that your dividend growth, while impressive, is slowing a bit relative to other recent periods. Maybe you could help us understand kind of what's driving this dynamic at play. Is it concerns around near-term performance of key products, Humira erosion continuing next year, or are you preserving capital for use elsewhere? Maybe some color on that would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nSo Evan, it's Rob. If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in 2023 and 2024 while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at; we're going to be in the mid-50s. We have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in the, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see your payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend. But we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining.\n\nBut given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in the mid-50s. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this. And we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then when we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again. But that's a dynamic that we're balancing here.\n\nThanks, Evan. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nYes. Our last question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nHi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I've got two. Just one, a confirmation on the trough, and then one on aesthetics. So on the trough in 2024, you mentioned that costs, you'll have the same margin in 2024 as 2023. So is it going to be a trough year on sales rather than the trough being driven by costs? And then second, again, just lots of noise on GLP-1s impacting aesthetics. You've commented before on fillers and Ozempic face in the past, but there's potential impact on body sculpting. Is this actually anything that you're seeing coming through yet in the sales? And overall, is this trend a net positive or a net negative for you? Thanks very much.\n\nTrung, this is Rob. Clearly, we've communicated a floor for earnings. Scott previously mentioned that expect a similar level of operating margin year over year. So you can model the sales accordingly. It should be fairly clear. Operating margin profile. Operating margin profile, yes. So we said the 46% to 47% is the way to think about operating margin profile in 2023 and 2024. We've given you the $11 EPS IPR&D as a floor for next year. So I would suggest using those parameters to model revenue. Carrie?\n\nHi, this is Carrie. For your question around the weight loss products and the impact on the aesthetics business, I mean, as we look at the long-term view of this market, we continue to think that anything that gets a subset of patients engaged in their appearance, which these weight loss products can do, that is a positive tailwind for our business. We hear that from our customers. Many of our customers are bringing these GLP-1s into their practice. They see it as a natural opportunity to cross-sell. Now, that said, in the short term, especially in an environment where discretionary spending is pressured, and there could be trade-offs for higher-priced products such as fillers or body contouring. Now, we're not necessarily seeing that as a driver. Right now, what we're seeing is the broader macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nBut in the short term, that could be a trade-off in terms of share of wallet. But absolutely, in the long term, this is something that is going to help patients get engaged in aesthetics and be an opportunity for cross-selling.\n\nThanks, Trung. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nThank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly 7 months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. .\nThe U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients.\nSo in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. AbbVie delivered excellent results once again this quarter. We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint.\nTotal net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These 2 agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue.\nU.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of 2 points versus our original guidance.\nNeuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth.\nGiven the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. .\nWhen you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly 1 out of 2 every in-play patients, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals. We feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well. with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries.\nTurning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi.\nMoving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across 7 distinct indications, including 4 in rheumatology, 2 in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly 1 out of every 4 in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting.\nAnd the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease. This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade.\nGlobal Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price.\nTurning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list. We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in heme onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis.\nVraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions. Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta.\nLastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie C. Strom\n\nSenior VP of AbbVie & President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S.\nU.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates.\nU.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.\nBotox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers. Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year.\nOur international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis.\nGrowth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter.\nOn a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion and injector training. We continue to invest in our pipeline as well. and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic in Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets. We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas J. Hudson\n\nSenior VP of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline over the quarter. We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs.\nIn immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement. Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, a hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year. We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well.\nMoving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024.\nWe also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients.\nIn addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily. Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration.\nIn oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received 2 or more systemic therapies. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy. We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.\nIn our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM 1 trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination. In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. We additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide.\nLooking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncolograms, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months. And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months.\nAt the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%. We're also encouraged by the doability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of 5 prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study.\nNow moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our Abeta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our Abeta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options.\nIn our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from 2 additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nChristopher Thomas Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan.\nStarting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nImportantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform.\nWe now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access.\nMoving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales.\nTurning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.",

Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2023. With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price.\nSince our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years.\nIn summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations.\nFirst quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations.\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC.\nWe are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience.\nAesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.\nBased on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12.\nIn closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%.\nIn psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis.\nThis best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets.\nIn Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming.\nWe also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year.\nTurning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S.\nWe are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year.\nSo we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents.\nGlobal Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price.\nTurning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL.\nIn neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly.\nWithin migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile.\nLastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie C. Strom\n\nSenior VP of AbbVie & President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year.\nU.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers.\nThe U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable.\nSales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S.\nWhile the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels.\nOur international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year.\nRecall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business.\nLonger term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas J. Hudson\n\nSenior VP of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline to start this year. In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.\nIn our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year.\nIn oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval.\nWe're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer.\nMoving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine.\nTurning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24.\nIn international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders.\nThe programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS.\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program.\nWe also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset.\nNow moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023.\nBotox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment.\nSo in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. I will discuss our most recent financial results and guidance. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S.\nTurning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, first question, please.",

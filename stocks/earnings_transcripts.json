Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is proud to report $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% from a year ago and a September quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $28.8 billion, growing 15% from a year ago. EPS came in at $1.85 setting a September quarter record. We grew in the vast majority of markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of markets, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and South Asia. We also set a September quarter revenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record in India. These results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple in which we achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal year.\nWe set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set an all-time revenue record for iPhone. And in Services, we achieved all-time records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the tremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as our deep commitment to innovation. We are incredibly excited about the strength we're seeing across our products and services and we expect the December quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone.\nWe are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That includes the biggest leap ever for iPhone, which has had a tremendous response from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more capable than ever to giving users ways to take charge of their health like never before, through new features like hypertension notifications and sleep score. And the next level sound quality and active noise cancellation of AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users.\nIn October, we also broke new ground and power-efficient performance with the uncomparably fast M5 chip, packed with neural accelerators in each GPU core to supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines game-changing features in iPad OS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At the same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with a laptop while the new M5 powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing possibilities on its infinite canvas.\nWe also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified experience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design is crafted with a new material called liquid glass that brings fluidity, vitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we delivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their devices. That includes updates to the phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to help users stay connected, continuity enhancements in MAC to deliver an even more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing system that fundamentally transforms the user experience in iPad OS 26.\nAs we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products and services, making every experience even more personal, capable and effortless. At the heart of it all is Apple Silicon, and we were thrilled to launch new products powered by the A19 Pro chip and M5. These incredibly advanced chips make Apple products the very best place to experience the power of AI. With Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that are powerful, intuitive, private and deeply integrated into the things people do every day. Features like live translation, which help users communicate across languages in real time and visual intelligence, which opens new ways to learn about and explore the world. We also introduced Workout Buddy, a new experience that uses AI to provide personalized motivational insights based on a user's workout data and fitness history.\nAnd these joined so many others from cleanup and photos and new image creation tools to powerful writing tools, we're also seeing developers take advantage of our own device foundation models to create entirely new experiences for users around the world. We're also excited for our more personalized Siri. We're making good progress on it. And as we've shared, we expect to release it next year.\nNow let's take a closer look at the September quarter results across our lineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September quarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in the vast majority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from the inside out and powered by the outstanding A19 pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro is by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new standard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our best camera system ever with an all-new ADEX telephoto camera and look stunning with bold new finishes like COSMIC Orange. The iPhone Air introduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter display with promotion, the iPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with features users will love.\nIn MAC, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular laptop. Mac mini users are loving how much performance is packed into our smallest Mac ever made while Mac Studio customers are pushing the envelope of what's possible with our most powerful Mac ever, and the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro unlocks incredible speed and next level performance with the all-new M5 chip, which delivers 3.5x faster AI performance than M4.\nTurning to iPad. Revenue was $7 billion for the September quarter. Last month, we released 1 of the most attention grabbing software updates we've had in years with iPad OS 26 and we recently gave iPad users even more to love with the launch of the incredible M5 iPad Pro, which offers an incredible boost in AI performance. With an unmatched combination of power and versatility, the new iPad Pro makes every interaction delightful with its thin, light and portable design. In Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to unlock new possibilities for users with the launch of our newest Apple Watch lineup, making the world's most popular watch even better. That includes Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the largest display ever in an Apple watch, improved battery life and emergency SOS via satellite.\nApple Watch Series 11 brings our users the most comprehensive set of health features yet. And Apple Watch SC3 delivers advanced capabilities at an incredible value. AI and advanced machine learning are at the core of powerful health features like heart rate monitoring, fall detection, crash detection and more. With our latest Apple Watch lineup, we were proud to introduce hypertension notifications, developed using large-scale machine learning models. Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for heart attack and stroke affecting more than 1 billion adults worldwide, and we expect to notify more than 1 million users of this life-threatening condition. We're also excited about sleep score, a simple, intuitive way to help users better understand their sleep quality and discover ways to improve it. That's something I'm sure we can all benefit from.\nMeanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a huge hit. You have to hear them to really understand just how remarkable they are. users and reviewers alike are praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature the world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to 2x as much noise as the previous generation. And with live translation powered by Apple Intelligence, AirPods deliver an incredibly new and exciting experience for users around the world.\nTurning to Services. As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for the September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new all-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music, payment services and video. Apple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins. The studio led the night with 13 wins the most of any comedy series in Emmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the accolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now earned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful original storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new productions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like slow horses and the morning show.\nAnd soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on track Day, thanks to a new partnership with Formula One. F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world. And starting next year, Apple TV will be the place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season. And in addition, F1, the movie, one of the year's biggest blockbusters will be coming to Apple TV on December 12.\nDuring the September quarter, we also marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around the world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips.\nTurning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our best ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and China. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Ginza store and the energy among the crowd was truly remarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the United States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome customers to the beautiful new space.\nEverywhere we operate, and in everything we do, we strive to give the best to our users while living by our values, whether that's building new accessibility features into our most recent software releases or advancing our environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest lineup or providing free educational programming to train and support American businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. And we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will transform our future.\nA great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed to invest $600 billion over the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in strategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. These commitments build on our long-standing investments in America, while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in Houston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping its first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to-end silicon supply chain across the country.\nIn recent months, I've connected with developers, innovators, artists, entrepreneurs and so many others around the world, people passionate about innovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is another reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to do more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along the way. As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\n5:16:34PM\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion was up 8% year-over-year and is a new September quarter record. We set some temporal quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and MAC and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our exceptional customer satisfaction and strong levels of loyalty, our installed base of active devices has reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $28.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was broad-based, with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets we track and double-digit growth across most of our services categories. Company gross margin was 47.2%, above the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix.\nThis includes approximately $1.1 billion of tariff-related costs, which is in line with what we had estimated on our last call. Products gross margin was 36.2%, up 170 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 75.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increased investment in R&D. These strong levels of business performance led to September quarter records for both net income and diluted earnings per share.\nNet income was $27.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.85, up 13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the onetime charge we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also a September quarter record at $29.7 billion.\nNow I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we track with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in India. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high, and we set a September quarter record for upgraders.\nAccording to the recent survey from World Panel, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan. We continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by MacBook Air. We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac installed base reached another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. And the latest customer satisfaction for Mac in the U.S. was reported at 96%.\niPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year, offset by the better-than-expected performance on the iPad. The installed base reached an all-time high with a September quarter record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, flat year-over-year. This was driven by growth on Watch and AirPods, offset by accessories, which was impacted by strong performance in the year ago quarter, driven by the iPad launches.\nBoth the Apple Watch and AirPods installed bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and we also set a September record for upgraders an Apple Watch. And in the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $28.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific as well as a September quarter record in Greater China.\nThe majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration. And as Tim mentioned, we set many all-time revenue records, including payment services, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double-digit growth year-over-year on Apple Pay Active Users. This strong momentum in the September quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to surpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year and our best ever. The growth of our installed base of active devices continues to offer us great opportunities for the future.\nCustomer engagement across our services offerings also continue to grow both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, and we continue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our services offerings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly 90 countries, to AppleCare One, a great new way to cover multiple Apple products in a single plan.\nTurning to enterprise. We are seeing an adoption of Apple products accelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation. The BMW Group has been deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including the factory employees to further strengthen its digital capabilities and advance innovation at the company. Capital One has expanded its Mac Choice program by adding thousands more MacBook Airs across its workforce. In the Czech Republic, its largest bank, [indiscernible], continues to invest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000 iPhones in addition to its existing thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue University has launched a spatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare students to lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\nLet's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3 billion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion, resulting in $99 billion in total debt.\nTherefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $34 billion. During the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 89 million Apple shares. Taking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025 results. As Tim mentioned, total company revenue for the year was $416 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to very strong full year operating results with all-time records for net income and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an adjusted basis.\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-year, which will be our best quarter ever.\nWe expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac launches in the year ago quarter. We expect services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025.\nWe expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an estimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said before, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI, while continuing to invest in our product road map. And so for the December quarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nCopyright © 2023, S&P Global Market Intelligence\n(and its affiliates as applicable). All rights reserved.\n\nCONTACT SALES\n"

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:02:26PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are proud to report a June quarter revenue record of $94 billion, up 10% from a year ago, which was better than we expected. EPS set a June quarter record of $1.57, up 12% year-over-year. We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets.\nWe had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac, and services. We set a June quarter record for iPhone, which grew a strong 13% year-over-year. We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia, and Brazil.\nMac continued to see excellent results, with revenue up 15% year-over-year. We set another all-time revenue record in services, which grew 13%, with double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Last month, we hosted WWDC, an incredible event for our developer community, with millions joining us online and more than a thousand developers here in person at Apple Park. We shared some truly exciting updates, including a stunning new design crafted from a material we call liquid glass. It's both beautiful and expressive, and for the first time ever, this design extends across all of our platforms. We can't wait for users everywhere to experience it this fall.\nWe were excited to share some updates across our AI work. We announced even more capabilities coming later this year, including Live Translation and Workout Buddy. In addition to those new features, we announced new support for a number of languages. We opened up access to the on-device foundation models at the core of Apple Intelligence, enabling developers to build a whole new experience for our users. It's wonderful to see great momentum building for our platforms. iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had.\nTaking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms, and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone. That's at the heart of our AI strategy.\nWith Apple Intelligence, we're integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private, and seamless, right where users need them. We've already released more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup, and powerful writing tools. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year.\nApple silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers, also powered by Apple silicon, deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our private cloud compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad, and iPhone. We're excited about the work we're doing in this space, and it's incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building.\nNow let me turn to more details about our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago, and we set a June quarter record for upgraders. This strong, broad-based performance was driven by the incredible popularity of the iPhone 16 family, which was up strong double-digits year-over-year as compared to the 15 family. We also recently marked a significant milestone. We shipped the 3 billionth iPhone since its launch in 2007.\nFrom the Pro models with the powerhouse A18 Pro and innovative Pro camera features to the iPhone 16e with breakthrough battery life and a two-in-one camera system, users are finding so many reasons to love the best iPhone lineup we've ever created. iOS 26 will take that experience even further. In addition to the beautiful new design and powerful Apple Intelligence features, it introduces a range of meaningful updates, like real-time call screening and hold assist in the phone app, smarter messaging tools, and new live translation features. It all adds up to a smarter, more personal iPhone experience that we can't wait for users everywhere to enjoy this fall.\nIn Mac, we had another strong quarter with revenue of $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by the strength of the M4 MacBook Air. We set a June quarter record for upgraders on Mac, and we saw great performance in emerging markets with strong double-digit growth on revenue, as well as strong double-digit growth on both upgraders and customers new to Mac. MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop, unlocks a whole new level of performance with the power of M4.\nMacBook Pro customers, meanwhile, continue to be drawn to its incredible power and the longest battery life we've ever had on a Mac. Customers are also loving the newest Mac Studio, which is the most powerful Mac we've ever made, with next-level capabilities to tackle even the most demanding AI workflows. At the same time, Mac mini continues to win over customers by packing so much performance into an ultra-compact design. With fantastic new updates in macOS Tahoe 26, from the phone app to live activities to our biggest ever update to Spotlight, Mac users across our entire lineup are going to find delightful new ways to stay connected and productive.\nFor iPad, June quarter revenue was $6.6 billion. Our incredibly versatile iPad lineup brings together power and portability like never before. Users are already excited for our biggest iPad software update ever with the upcoming release of iPadOS 26. It starts with a new windowing system that's remarkably intuitive, giving users more control than ever of their iPad experience. An enhanced Files app makes it easier than ever to stay organized. That's all on top of a beautiful new software design that brings these updates to life. Turning to wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $7.4 billion, and we saw a June quarter record for upgraders to Apple Watch.\nDuring the quarter, we marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple Watch, celebrating a decade of helping users navigate their health and fitness journeys. With watchOS 26, Apple Watch will be more intelligent than ever, with smart updates to the Workout app and SmartStack, along with a fresh new design that feels both dynamic and personal.\nWe're also thrilled about what's coming to Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 26, introducing spatial widgets that let users customize their digital space, more lifelike personas, and new enterprise APIs that empower companies to build their own spatial experiences. This fall, new features for our latest AirPods lineup will unlock even more possibilities, from studio-quality audio recording to using AirPods as a camera remote, giving users powerful new ways to capture content and stay connected.\nAs we're innovating across our lineup, we're especially proud of the work we're doing to help our users live healthier lives. Since we first launched our hearing health features for AirPods Pro 2, I've received notes from people who are delighted to be able to connect more deeply with loved ones. Whether it's with AirPods Pro 2, Apple Watch, or iPhone, it's amazing to see the power of our health and safety features. From hearing tests to fall detection alerts to irregular rhythm notifications, having such a profound impact.\nTurning to services, revenue for the June quarter was $27.4 billion, up 13% from a year ago, and an all-time record. Apple TV+ scored 81 nominations, a record for the platform, across nearly every eligible category for this year's Emmy Awards. Severance leads all Emmy nominees with 27 nominations, and the studio follows close behind with 23 nominations, more than any other freshman comedy series ever. It's amazing to see how these and other Apple TV shows have captured the popular imagination. To date, Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,700 award nominations and 585 wins on the strength of the highest-rated original content of any streaming network.\nWe continue to see very positive trends in the June quarter, with TV+ viewership up strong double-digits year-over-year. In June, we were also thrilled to release F1 in theaters around the world, one of the summer's most unforgettable blockbusters. During the quarter, we celebrated a big anniversary with 10 years of Apple Music. To mark the occasion, we launched an all-new studio space in Los Angeles for artists to create content and connect with fans.\nLater this year, we're bringing Apple Music users even more to love, from an enhanced listening experience with AutoMix, which mixes songs like a DJ, to lyrics translation, and more. The App Store, meanwhile, continues to be the very best place to discover the latest apps from developers around the world in a safe and trusted way, and App Store revenue grew double-digits year-over-year, setting a June quarter record.\nIn retail, we continue to find opportunities in emerging markets to connect with even more customers. We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn't be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year. We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.\nAcross everything we do at Apple, we show up by leading with our values. We feel strongly that the benefits of technology should be shared by everyone. That's why we make technology for everyone. In May, to mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we announced updates to help users learn, connect, and interact with their worlds, including Magnifier for Mac, a new Braille experience, and Accessibility Reader, a new system-wide reading mode to make it easier to understand content.\nWe're proud to introduce Accessibility Nutrition Labels, giving users an understanding of accessibility features before they download an app, while helping developers educate people on features their apps support. This month, we also announced a half-a-billion-dollar commitment with MP Materials to strengthen the supply of vital recycled rare earth materials in the US and support American industry. In August, we're opening our all-new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to train and support American manufacturers.\nThese investments are part of Apple's largest-ever spend commitment, which we announced earlier this year. Over the next four years, Apple is investing $500 billion in the US, driving innovation and creating jobs in cutting-edge fields like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering, and artificial intelligence. We're proud of this work and all that we're doing to tap into American innovation and bring the best technology experiences to users across the globe. We continue to look for further opportunities to do even more.\nFinally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates.\nWe're really proud of our results for the June quarter, and I want to thank our teams and our customers. In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:17:33PM\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $94 billion was up 10% year-over-year and is a new June quarter record. We grew in every geographic segment and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $66.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and Mac. Thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.\nServices revenue was $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and an all-time record. We saw strength across the world, with double-digit growth in the majority of our markets. Company gross margin was 46.5%, at the high end of our guidance range and down 60 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by approximately $800 million in tariff-related costs Tim mentioned earlier.\nProducts gross margin was 34.5%, down 140 basis points sequentially, driven by mix and tariff-related costs, partly offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 75.6%, down 10 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.5 billion, up 8% year-over-year. This strong business performance led to June quarter records for both net income at $23.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.57, which was up 12% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $27.9 billion.\nNow, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. As Tim noted, we saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in many emerging markets. The iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and we reached a June quarter record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Worldpanel, formerly of Kantar, iPhone was a top-selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan during the June quarter.\nWe continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the US at 98%, as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including MacBook Air, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro. We grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in Europe, Greater China, and the rest of Asia Pacific.\nThe Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we hit a June quarter record for upgraders. In the US, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97%. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year, which was expected given the difficult compare against the launch of the iPad Air and iPad Pro in the year-ago quarter. At the same time, the iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the US.\nWearables, home, and accessories revenue was $7.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year. This was driven by a difficult compare on accessories due to the prior year's iPad launches that I just referred to. The Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We also set a quarterly record for upgraders on Apple Watch, and the latest customer satisfaction for watch in the US was reported at 97%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\nThe performance in the June quarter was broad-based. We saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of the categories, including cloud services, where we reached an all-time revenue record driven by the year-over-year growth of iCloud paying accounts. We saw strong momentum during the June quarter, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future.\nCustomer engagement across our services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings, from the new Apple Games app to a continued expansion of Tap to Pay and Wallet.\nTurning to enterprise, organizations are continuing to invest in Apple products to drive employee innovation and productivity. With companies like PayPal and Roche deploying more Macs for their workforce, we had the best June quarter ever for Mac and enterprise.\nIn Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank, one of the largest Thai banks, has deployed thousands of iPads across their branches to enhance the quality and efficiency of their banking operations, from loan services to wealth management. CAE, a leader in pilot training and simulation technology, is using Apple Vision Pro to enable pilots to become more familiar with aircraft procedures, leading to more productive in-person flight simulator training outcomes.\nLet's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $5.7 billion of debt maturities, issued $4.5 billion of new debt, and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $102 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $31 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares.\nAs we move into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies, and application remain in effect as of this call, the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today, and the current revenue share agreement with Google continues. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow mid to high single-digits year-over-year.\nWe expect services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%, which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around -$25 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 17%.\nFinally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on 14 August 2025 to shareholders of record as of 11 August 2025. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:25:10PM\n\nThank you, Kevan. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:25:18PM\n\nCertainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:25:54PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. I just have one on upgrade rates and one on CapEx. First, on the upgrade rates. It was encouraging to see the records on iPhone, Mac, and watch. I was wondering if you're seeing strength in the upgrade rates, or is the records more a function of the growing install base? What is your research showing that made upgrades particularly compelling this year? For example, is it product features, tariff pull forward, perhaps Apple Intelligence? I'll give my follow-up on CapEx.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:25:52PM\n\nOkay. You want to do CapEx first?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:26:01PM\n\nYeah, I'll do CapEx first.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:27:01PM\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:27:01PM\n\nYeah, go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:27:01PM\n\nJust on the CapEx. It's up notably year -to-date. Could you just comment on your capital spending plans this year and next and provide some qualitative color in terms of what's driving that growth? Is it AI-related or supply chain diversification, for instance? Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:27:01PM\n\nYeah, Mike, it's a combination of factors. I would say a pretty significant driver, as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investments significantly in AI, so that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we've been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers.\nThe other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where, in cases, we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. You are going to see an increase in CapEx.We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities, in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you're seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:27:21PM\n\nOn the upgrades. Michael, if you look at iPhone, the 16 family grew double-digit as opposed to the 15 family from the year-ago quarter, and so we did set an upgrade record. I think it directly is because of the strength of the product. Mac also set records on upgrade, and I think we continue to see a move to Apple silicon, and the performance of Apple silicon is playing a very key role. It was an incredible quarter. In terms of if you're wondering about pull forward, we would estimate the pull forward of demand into April specifically to be about one point of the 10 points in terms of people buying because of discussions about tariffs.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:32:05PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:28:07PM\n\nThank you, Tim. Thank you, Kevan.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:32:05PM\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:28:14PM\n\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nHead of US IT Hardware, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:28:21PM\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe starting with you. Shortly after March quarter earnings, there were some reports about searches on Safari declining in April for the first time, I think, in over two decades. Judging by your 13% services growth this quarter, it doesn't seem to indicate that April trends necessarily played out through the remainder of the June quarter.\nI'm really just looking for a little bit more color on how the rest of the quarter played out. If you believe Apple products as kind of search access points are losing their strategic value as AI platforms become more valuable, popular, or increasing in strategic value? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:29:07PM\n\nI think they continue to be very valuable. I think that consumers' behaviors are evolving, and we are monitoring it very closely.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nHead of US IT Hardware, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:29:22PM\n\nOkay. I appreciate that color. Thanks, Tim. Maybe second to that, I would love if you could elaborate a bit on what you are seeing in China. I think in an interview earlier this afternoon, you alluded to some of the promotions being tailwinds, but just bigger picture, if we take a step back in China, how would you characterize demand, interest in the iPhone 16, and some of your other products? Is that shifting, or maybe were some of the trends in the June quarter a bit more one-time and unique in nature? Thank you so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:30:00PM\n\nYeah, we did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter. It was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the Mac year-over-year. As you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affect some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them, and I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. It cut in during a portion of the previous quarter.\nThe other things I would say are that the install base hit a record high in Greater China, and we set an all-time record for the iPhone install base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. According to Worldpanel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top three models in urban China, which is extraordinary.\nAlso, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad, and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in Mainland China were new to the product. Lots of good things there. The other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, the MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. Overall, a very positive quarter.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nHead of US IT Hardware, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:32:05PM\n\nGreat, thanks for the color, Tim. Good luck.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:32:05PM\n\nAll right, thank you, Eric. Thanks, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:32:12PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Mileus Research\n\n5:32:55PM\n\nYeah, thanks. I really appreciate it. I wanted to ask about Siri, Tim, and just the overall AI investment. There's a perception that Siri is going to help drive other new products potentially that maybe where voice is quite needed. Just wondering, how's your confidence towards launching that next year? Is there anything that's been done internally to increase that confidence? Is it tied to the investment? I just think folks would love to know a little bit more about your confidence and how that's going. I have a follow-up, thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:32:54PM\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier. Our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated. Of course, we've done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far, from visual intelligence to cleanup to writing tools and all the rest. We are significantly growing our investment. We did during the June quarter. We will again in the September quarter.\nI'm not putting specific numbers behind that at this point, but you can probably tell in the guidance that things are moving up.We are also reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company. We have a great team, and we're putting all of our energy behind it. In terms of products, in terms of other products, I don't want to really comment on specific other products, but we have an exciting roadmap ahead, and I could not be more excited about it.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Mileus Research\n\n5:35:11PM\n\nThat's great, Tim. Thanks for the color. Just with regard to my second question, it's about the overall revenue guide, and I appreciate that you guide the best you can see it, but I just wanted to challenge it from a different way. Why would it decelerate if services are staying the same at 13%? Is there a conservatism there? I would think even currency is just as favorable, if not more favorable. Why would it decelerate to the higher single-digits from where you were in the quarter, or is it just being conservative? If there's something decelerating or a comp, do you mind just pointing that out? Thanks.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:35:46PM\n\nYeah, Ben, this is Kevan. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at the growth from Q3, which is reported to the mid to high single-digit guide, you have to kind of keep in mind two components. The first is the effect of the tariff-related pull ahead in demand that Tim referenced earlier, which we estimated to be about one point of the 10 points that we ended up doing in Q3.\nThe other factor that I think you have to take into consideration is the fact that in the September quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the iPad launches, which also leads to a difficult compare this year. Those two components are things you have to take into consideration as you think about the move from Q3 to Q4. I would say foreign exchange is a very minor tailwind going from Q3 to Q4, so not really a major factor.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Mileus Research\n\n5:35:56PM\n\nOkay, thanks a lot.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:36:06PM\n\nAwesome. Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:36:13PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:36:52PM\n\nHi, yes, thank you so much. Tim, I know you said similar growth in services, and that's predicated with Google payments continuing. Is there any way for us to dimensionalize, sort of, or maybe just conceptually talk about maybe options if the counter were to happen, if the payments were not allowed in some way? What are some of the things that Apple could do, given that it is a significant chunk of profitability? I will follow up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:36:52PM\n\nYeah, Wamsi, I don't really want to speculate on the court ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a consequence of it.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:37:16PM\n\nOkay. Okay, I guess we'll wait for that ruling to come out. I guess separately, Tim, at a high level, when you look at some of what is perceived fears of new form factors and ways to interact with devices, there was some worry that, given some of the developments in AI, there could be a world where dependence on screen-based devices significantly diminishes. I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts on if you think that would happen and rate and pace in which, and how do you think Apple is preparing in that case?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:37:48PM\n\nYeah, when you think about all the things an iPhone can do, from connecting people to bringing app and game experiences to life to taking photos and videos. To helping users explore the world and conduct their financial lives and pay for things and so much more. It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it. That doesn't mean that we are not thinking about other things as well. I think that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:38:32PM\n\nOkay. Thank you so much, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:38:32PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:38:32PM\n\nThank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:38:40PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Darynani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:39:06PM\n\nYep. Good afternoon. I guess to start with, Tim, the tariff assumption of $1.1 billion in the September quarter, I understand the uptick you folks are talking about. Can you just talk about, assuming tariffs remain at these levels or even if they evolve under Section 232, how do you eventually think about offsetting this headwind to your P&L? When do you decide to execute on the levers to offset this headwind versus just flowing it to your bottom line?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:39:23PM\n\nRight now, we're just estimating the cost of it. It's up quarter-over-quarter because our volume is up quarter-over-quarter. There was some build ahead in the previous quarter, so that's the primary reason that it's up. In terms of what we do to mitigate, we obviously try to optimize our supply chain.\nUltimately, we will do more in the United States. We've committed $500 billion investment in the US over the next four years. We're already building chips in Arizona. In fact, we're building semiconductors across 12 states and 24 factories and have a lot of other things in the works. You probably saw the investment in MP Materials last week. We continue to explore these things and look for more that we can do, which I think ultimately is the objective.\n\nAmit Darynani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:40:51PM\n\nGot it. Super helpful. Then your services growth, I think, was extremely impressive at 13%, especially given all the fears folks had. Can you just touch on, did you see any impact that was notable from the Epic case and the steering dynamics that came after that? Maybe just touch on what does that appeals process look like for me as you go forward? Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:41:26PM\n\nYeah, this is Kevan. Let me take that one. In general, I think just reminding, I think you just said we had a very strong services quarter. We had an all-time record at the $27.4 billion, up 13%. The one thing I would also say is our services performance is broad-based. We also saw strength in developed and emerging markets. Both parts of the world had double-digit growth. We also saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of our categories, including cloud services, where I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had an all-time revenue record.\nAs it relates to the Epic decision, keep in mind we only just introduced the change required by the court in the June quarter. As you know, we don't provide the level of detail. In general, I would say, in the US, we had double-digit growth for the US App Store, and we set an all-time record. We will continue to monitor the effects on our business, but we will continue to innovate and ensure that the App Store delivers the best experience for users and remains a great business opportunity for developers.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:42:01PM\n\nThank you, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:42:08PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:42:06PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I have two questions as well. Maybe, Tim, just on the supply chain strategy. I know last quarter you talked about focusing production or assembly to India. I just want to get an update on how you are thinking about the strategy holistically, given sort of the tariff rates I think in India potentially are higher than I think anyone had expected. I know you mentioned some US investments, but we will have to kind of get your thoughts on how you are thinking about China versus the rest of Southeast Asia and India going forward.\nI will give you my second question also. Kevan, I am just trying to understand a little bit more about the demand drivers of iPhone in the quarter because obviously the 16 has been in the market for some time. I know there was some promotional activity, but seasonally, you generally do not see this kind of strength in the June quarter.Maybe can you help us understand, outside of maybe the promotional activity, what else were some of the drivers that led to what looks like a pretty significant above-seasonal strength in the June quarter? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:43:15PM\n\nYeah. In terms of the tariff situation and country of origin and so forth, one thing I would say just to remind everyone is, keep in mind that the vast majority of our products are covered under the Section 232 investigation. Today, or I should say last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the EEPA tariffs that hit early in the year related to China. That is just a reminder of where things are and what we assumed as we. Calculated the projection of 1.1 billion. That's in our outlook color.\nIn terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhones sold in the US, or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India. The vast majority of the other products, the Mac, the iPad, and the watch, have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China. That hopefully gives you a flavor of where things are.\nI would stress again that we do a lot in this country, in the United States, and we've committed $500 billion, and we're always looking to do more. You could kind of see that in the most recent announcements, whether it's MP Materials or our manufacturing academy that we're standing up in Detroit in a couple of weeks or so. We're going to be doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly $19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more. Of course, glass for iPhone and the Face ID module. There are loads of different things that are done in the United States.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:46:24PM\n\nOn the iPhone activity?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:46:24PM\n\nYeah. I was going to mention the iPhone activity. You asked if there's any kind of unique characteristics this quarter. I would just say, as Tim outlined, we really believe that the strong upgrade performance, which was a June quarter record, was really driven by the strength of the product lineup. The iPhone 16 family has done incredibly well compared to the iPhone 15 family. We also, as you recall, recently introduced the 16e as well, which also continued to impact the success of the overall iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:46:32PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:49:12PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:49:12PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:46:29PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:46:40PM\n\n[inaudible]. The first one's for Kevan. This was a previous question. Do you think there was any pulling of iPhones in the June quarter that led to some of the upside? How do you think about channel inventory in June quarter and how it looks in September relative to seasonal trends? I have a longer-term follow-up for Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:47:01PM\n\nLet me see if I can answer the channel inventory question or what I think is the channel inventory question. If you look at iPhone channel inventory from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we reduced it, and it ended toward the low end of our targeted range. That's the answer on the inventory piece of it.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:47:26PM\n\nYeah, and I think you also asked about the pull ahead impact. I think we referenced that earlier. Just to be clear on what we believe we saw in the June quarter, we did see some obvious signs of pull ahead really in the April timeframe around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace. We felt that was, from what we saw, about a one-point impact of the 10-point at a total company level of growth. That was the limited impact that we believe we saw for the quarter.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:47:55PM\n\nGot it. Very helpful. I think I just have a long-term follow-up for Tim. Tim, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There's some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you see a scenario where LLMs become a core part of your iOS, or is the SLM the way to go? How to think about the evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world, and is smartphone going to be the choice of device? I'm curious of your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:48:31PM\n\nThe way that we look at AI is that it's one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. I think it will affect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn't want to really talk about today because that gives away some things on our strategy. I think it's a good question.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:49:01PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:57PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:52:18PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:49:09PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:49:17PM\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, maybe if I can start with your remarks about the pull ahead being about a 1 percentage point benefit here. Anything to share in terms of what's underlying that estimate in terms of what you're seeing for, is it a pull ahead largely on iPhones, or is it across the board, and is it primarily in the US, or again, sort of across multiple regions? Any color there would be helpful in terms of how you're sort of getting to that assumption there and have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:51PM\n\nIt was principally on iPhone and Mac. It was pretty, it was obvious evidence of it. It was an unusual buying pattern there that largely occurred in April toward the beginning of the quarter. Really, we believe it was largely the United States.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:50:22PM\n\nOkay, okay. Got it. Maybe on the tariff front, when you gave the estimate of $900 million last quarter, which came in at $800 million, you did highlight there were some unique factors in the quarter. When I take the $1.1 billion that you're now sort of expecting for the September quarter, and as we start to think about December, is there anything unique in the December quarter in terms of sourcing from regions, etc., that would uniquely impact December, just given sort of that you had highlighted the quarter-to-quarter? There would be unique things. Just curious if December looks very different from September because of any unique factors.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:51:04PM\n\nI would be careful about projecting based on the numbers from Q2 and Q3 because, one, we're uncertain of what the rates will be, and so the rates may change. Two, particularly in last quarter, we had some build-ahead inventory that we had within the company and within our supply chain, and so those two are a little unique. Also, as you know from following us for so long, Q1 is generally a higher volume quarter, and the tariffs are currently pretty linear with volume.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:52:05PM\n\nNo, understood. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:55:30PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nStock Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:52:11PM\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:52:12PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:52:16PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:52:23PM\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well, and I'll just ask them together. I guess the first one's just more housekeeping. Kevan, when we think about currency impact, how much of a benefit was currency this quarter? I guess across the business and, in particular, maybe on the services segment. On a year-on-year basis, how much currency benefit should we be thinking about embedded in the guidance into the September quarter?\nThe second quick question is, CapEx is clearly moving higher. I know you guys don't guide specifically to that number, but just kind of qualitatively, as you lean in more on AI, should we really start to see that CapEx, which is running close to about $4 billion annualized today, really start to move appreciably higher? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:53:14PM\n\nGreat, Aaron. Thanks for the questions. Let me answer the first one. First, around foreign exchange. For Q3, we really had no impact from a foreign exchange standpoint on the year-on-year results. When we look at both the revenue. Growth as well as the gross margin, there was really virtually no impact from foreign exchange. As we look at going from Q3, the June quarter, to the September quarter, again, very, very, as I mentioned earlier, a very small tailwind going from Q3 to Q4 from a foreign exchange standpoint on both revenue as well as gross margin.\nOn the second question, sure, on the CapEx side, I think we talked about the fact that we are, and Tim mentioned the fact that we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. You are going to continue to see our CapEx grow. It's not going to be exponential growth, but it is going to grow substantially. A lot of that's a function of the investments we're making in AI. As we mentioned, we also have other items that fall under that category, facilities, and some of our retail store investments. I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI.\nI would remind you that we do have a hybrid model, though, where we also leverage third-party infrastructure in addition to investing in our own first-party infrastructure.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:54:32PM\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:54:34PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:54:35PM\n\nThank you, Aaron. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:54:40PM\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nSemiconductor Equipment, Hardware, and Networking Equipment Analyst, Citi\n\n5:54:47PM\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, at the WWDC earlier in the quarter, you showed impressive updates on Vision Pro with the use of widgets, spatial scenes, persona, and new ways to create content. It appears like Meta and Xiaomi are seeing strong momentum on their AI glasses. Is the focus still around enterprises on Vision Pro, or are you thinking of broadening the use cases, maybe tying it to more of your devices? Any thoughts on Vision Pro as it did not get enough airtime in the prepared remarks?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:55:30PM\n\nYeah, thanks for bringing it up. I was thrilled with the release from the team on Vision OS 26. It includes many things in it, like spatial widgets to enable users to customize their digital space. The personas took a huge increase with, they're much more lifelike. Of course, there's new enterprise APIs for companies as well. As Kevan talked about in his opening remarks, we're seeing those things resonate out with CAE and other customers. We continue to be very focused on it. I don't want to get into the roadmap on it, but this is an area that we really believe in.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nSemiconductor Equipment, Hardware, and Networking Equipment Analyst, Citi\n\n5:56:36PM\n\nGreat. Kevan, historically, you guys have not done much big M&A. Do you feel like you need to accelerate your AI roadmap or just keep the organic focus?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:56:26PM\n\nLet me take that one as well. We've acquired around seven companies this year, and that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI-oriented. Think of it as one every several weeks. We're very open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap. We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. We basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a roadmap. If they do, then we're interested, but we don't have anything to share specifically today.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:57:15PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Atif. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. The number for the telephone replay is 866-583-1035. Please enter confirmation code 628-7473 followed by the pound sign. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00PM Pacific Time today.

My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures, and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Additional information will also be in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 29 March 2025, to be filed tomorrow, and in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:02:30PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today we are reporting $95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago, and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it.\nWe are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams and our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. We're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the US across all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago.\nDuring the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use camera control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with visual intelligence. Our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro, and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system, and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup.\nThe world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. Now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like writing tools and notification summaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad, revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double-digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them.\nThe new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the cleanup tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image One in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our hearing health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world.\nMillions have already taken hearing tests, and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple Immersive Video, which you have to see to believe. visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated, regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app.\nIn retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia, and new retail stores in India starting later this year. Let's now turn to services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago, with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice, to buying a coffee with Apple Pay, to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books, to using their favorite app from the App Store, or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day.\nWith incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends and Neighbors, and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. We're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. There is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching their favorite teams go to bat on Friday night baseball, to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass, to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula One now on the Apple Sports app.\nTurning to software, we just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks.\nWe designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. We went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with private cloud compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI. Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features, from helpful writing tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image One, Cleanup, Visual Intelligence, and a seamless connection to ChatGPT. We made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail messages, and more. We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions.\nWith regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Turning to sustainability, we just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations, and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of fresh water and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the lifecycle of our products by 2030.\nNow let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter.\nFor our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:14:24PM\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year, despite a headwind of almost 2.5% from foreign exchange.\nWe also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year, despite over 2% of foreign exchange headwinds. As Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin is 47.1% in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange, and a seasonal loss of leverage.\nServices gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total, and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan.\nWe continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the US at 97%, as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based, with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. The Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the US. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the US.\nWearables, home, and accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year-ago quarter, as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launch last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for Watch in the US was recently measured at 95%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future.\nCustomer engagement across our services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings, from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure, and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise, organizations are investing more in Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all US employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features.\nWe also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. Nubank, the largest digital bank in Latin America, has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software, has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders.\nThis included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward, as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on 15 May 2025 to shareholders of record as of 12 May 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to.\nImportantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies, and application remain in effect as of this call, and the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:22:38PM\n\nThanks. I ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:22:46PM\n\nCertainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:22:53PM\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, guys, for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the US currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the US to be by the end of your fiscal year? Is it the goal to source 100% of your US-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:23:31PM\n\nYeah. Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin, as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin, and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the US. If you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the US for products that have China as their country of origin.\nIn addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. For us, that's some of our US AppleCare and accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also, for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April, as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and downstream products that contain semiconductors. For the June quarter, as I talked about in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our costs.\nI wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:26:14PM\n\nI appreciate that, Colette. Thank you, Tim. Maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. Can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter, if you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide, and ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases, or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:26:57PM\n\nYeah. Thanks, Eric, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we do not believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone, but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that is reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you will see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. I hope that answers all your questions.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:27:59PM\n\nThanks so much, Tim. Good luck.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:28:01PM\n\nThanks.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:28:01PM\n\nThank you. Eric, Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:28:07PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks a lot.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\n5:28:18PM\n\nHey, Tim, if you had told me that on 2 April that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel, a quarter at $900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. You did make a comment about after the June quarter. Sorry to push you on that, could it be a multiple of that figure, or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June, and if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller, or what. Hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:28:58PM\n\nYeah. Ben, thanks for the question.\nI tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs. There is the Section 232 investigation going on, so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. June has the assumptions in it that I'd mentioned earlier.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\n5:29:39PM\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Tim. Just with regard to China, down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there, and perhaps it would have been worse than that. The trajectory there improving, even with subsidies, because subsidies benefited your competitors too. Just wondering if a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:30:19PM\n\nYeah. We were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. To provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. We did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11%. Going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. There wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included, some of them are not.\nGenerally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB 6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy. The other products have different rules. I do think it helped, and I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. Hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product, and that continues to look quite good in China. iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. There's some positive nuggets there.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\n5:32:20PM\n\nThanks a lot, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:32:20PM\n\nYep. Thank you, Ben.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:32:20PM\n\nThank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:32:29PM\n\nOur next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:32:34PM\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on the Section 232 investigation? Could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs, to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers, and other efficiency efforts that you might pursue? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:33:16PM\n\nYeah. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and will continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory.\nWe'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:33:54PM\n\nGreat, thanks. Just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors, but there was a year-over-year decline as well. Any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:34:19PM\n\nYeah, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. On the sequential, as we mentioned the comparative marks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal, loss of leverage, foreign exchange, and that was partly offset by cost savings. When we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on-year basis. That was driven by a different mix in foreign exchange.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:34:53PM\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:34:53PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:34:53PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:34:59PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:35:06PM\n\nYep. Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with the tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the $900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter, and what would the impact be without those benefits, essentially?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:35:28PM\n\nI wouldn't want to go through all of them. As an example, the build ahead that I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations were helpful.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:35:48PM\n\nGot it. As I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I'd love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:36:12PM\n\nYeah, Amit. Hey, it's Kevan. I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talked about the low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:36:28PM\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:36:42PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:36:42PM\n\nThanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:36:48PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:36:54PM\n\nYes. Thank you. Tim, Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the US in particular or other supply chain changes that you're making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure, and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory? I will follow up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:37:17PM\n\nWe're excited about bringing more production to the US. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. That's the SSC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the US, the Face ID module, and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. There's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. We don't really forecast beyond the current quarter, as you know.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:38:16PM\n\nYeah, maybe I'll add a couple more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different, and over the years, we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units, revenue, margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies.\nWe do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. Our products and services all have different levels of profitability, and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. I hope that's helpful color and context for you.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:38:57PM\n\nYeah. No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. Maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe developer behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has actually happened?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:39:39PM\n\nIt's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier, and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. As you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. The Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year, and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. At this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:40:26PM\n\nOkay. Thank you, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:40:37PM\n\nThank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:40:43PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalysts, UBS\n\n5:40:48PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two as well. Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. Can you kind of maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your sort of resiliency and redundancy following the changes that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? Is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Kevin, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:41:33PM\n\nIn terms of the resiliency and risk, etc., we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. We have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it, opened up new sources of supply. You could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:42:22PM\n\nHi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies, and application remain the same as they are today as of this call, and that the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalysts, UBS\n\n5:42:48PM\n\nOkay. No quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:42:59PM\n\nI would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalysts, UBS\n\n5:43:03PM\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:47:51PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:48:52PM\n\nThank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:43:06PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\n5:43:12PM\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in sort of the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out, or the delays that you talked about related to personalized CV features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:43:42PM\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April, so they actually rolled out in Q3.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\n5:44:06PM\n\nOkay. Got it. Maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers are, how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. I know you sort of prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. What are you seeing in terms of the US consumer, and what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw US GDP also shrink here in Q1. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the sort of iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:44:46PM\n\nI'm not an economist, and so I start by saying that. In terms of the, as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level.\nThe US is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. That's all I'd want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JP Morgan\n\n5:45:33PM\n\nThank you. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:42PM\n\nYep.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:45:38PM\n\nThank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:45:45PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar, TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:45:49PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'd go then to Tim. Thanks for that information on the $500 billion US investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that. How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona?Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful as an added follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:46:14PM\n\nWell, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split. As we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas, to California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. Standing up advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we'll do that through a partner as we do our manufacturing through a partner. We'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well. I'm sure some CapEx as well. It's a bit of all of it.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:47:07PM\n\nGot it. Got it. I kind of have a long-term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at in the past, you've spoken about AI on the edge. Obviously, it's very topical to you from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. I'm just kind of curious. When you look at AI on the edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future edge LLMs or inference? Or do you think we need to come up with a whole new different kind of device? I'm just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the edge devices from here. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:47:45PM\n\nYeah. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today, and there are some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device. Others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. Others for world knowledge with the integration with ChatGPT. We continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the roadmap, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:52:57PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:48:46PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:48:49PM\n\nOur next question is from Richard Kramer with Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nProfessor in the Department of Neuroscience, Berkeley Research\n\n5:48:56PM\n\nThank you very much. I won't ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Sirius system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack, or is it a matter of R&D spending? What are some of the key gating factors investors should look for, either at WWDC or beyond, to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements at the prior WWDC? Thanks.\nYeah. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:48PM\n\nWe've released a slew of those, from writing tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT, to Genmoji, to Image Playground, to Image One, to Cleanup and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, and the list goes on. We've delivered a lot. We just recently, a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. We've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. There's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. We are making progress. We're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there. Richard,\nI'll just add that on your question about investment, we don't underestimate invest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D that continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment, and we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our roadmap.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nProfessor in the Department of Neuroscience, Berkeley Research\n\n5:51:30PM\n\nThanks. Kevin, one for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google Antitrust trial touching on default search. Investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your services business.\nDo you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:52:11PM\n\nLet me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order, and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing, and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. We are monitoring these closely. As you point out, there's risk associated with them, and the outcome is unclear.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:52:57PM\n\nYeah. I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nProfessor in the Department of Neuroscience, Berkeley Research\n\n5:53:05PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:53:05PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:53:12PM\n\nWe'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:53:18PM\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. Kind of dovetailed with that is how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it $3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that? How does the strategy play out in your opinion?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:53:55PM\n\nWell, on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. We utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. As I mentioned in the $500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. We do plan on making investments in that area. We're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models, and we'll partner as well. I don't view it as an all-of-one or all-of-the-other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the private cloud compute.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:55:06PM\n\nYeah. As a follow-up, I'm curious with the iPhone 16e launching this quarter, internalizing your C1 modem. I'm curious of how you see kind of the modem strategy playing out or maybe just the continual deepening of that internal silicon opportunity for Apple.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:55:27PM\n\nWe're super excited to ship the first one and get it out there. It's gone well. We love that we can produce better products from a point of view of really focusing on battery life and other things that customers want. We have started on a journey, is the way I would put it.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:56:48PM\n\nThank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:55:52PM\n\nYep.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius\n\n5:55:52PM\n\nThank you, Aaron.

My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:02:01PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness+, Beats, and more, LA is home to many of our team members.\nOur thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts, and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now, turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year.\nWe achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business.\nI'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now, users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day.\nThey can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground, Genmoji, handle daily tasks, and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with CleanUp. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access ChatGPT across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.\nWe were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India.\nWe'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. Importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud.\nApple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions.\nOur iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18-powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life, and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further, with larger-than-ever displays, and a Pro Camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life.\nThere are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable but is our first carbon-neutral Mac.\nAll of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad, from the ultra-portable iPad Mini built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design.\niPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go, and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner, more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year.\nFrom the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work because we know how much it matters to our users.\nWe've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible, immersive entertainment experiences, and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display.\nVision Pro is also supercharging the creative process, and the incredibly talented director, John M. Chu, recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan.\nFive years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year, with new shows like The Studio, and Your Friends and Neighbors.\nWe can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1, starring Brad Pitt on 27 June 2024, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My service that can help our users when they lose their luggage.\nFor the first time, if you put an AirTag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the US.\nWe were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE, and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that we're opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members.\nThere's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was in AFib, and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially lifesaving treatment.\nAnother user put his new watch on for the first time, and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. There are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature, like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren.\nThese are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good, and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:13:49PM\n\nThanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue, with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific, and grew in the vast majority of markets we track.\nProducts revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.\nWe grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high end of our guidance range, and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix.\nOperating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range, up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories.\niPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia.\nThe iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total in every geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the US, urban China, India, the UK, France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the US at 96%, as measured by 451 Research.\nMac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest Neural Engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI on Mac.\nThe Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we saw double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the US was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air.\nThe iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the US, based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4, and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2.\nOn Watch, although we face a difficult compare against the Watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for Watch in the US was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.\nServices continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform.\nWe remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness+, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for their developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division.\nWe're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the US, with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed thousands of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation.\nVision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.\nAs we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we were projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar has strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5% on a year-over-year basis.\nDespite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%.\nWe expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OINE to be around -$300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on 13 February 2025 to shareholders of record as of 10 February 2025. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:22:24PM\n\nThank you, Kevan. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:22:33PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:22:38PM\n\nGreat, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already. I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:23:12PM\n\nYeah, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. We did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from writing tools to Image Playground, Genmoji, visual intelligence, and more. We see all of those being used.\nThe CleanUp is another one that is popular, and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had two, two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2, and then only had the UK and the other English-language countries for the two and a half weeks. We have just the early indications at the moment. We were going to.\n\nEric Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:24:31PM\n\nOkay. That's really helpful.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:24:31PM\n\nYeah. Go ahead.\n\nEric Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:24:35PM\n\nOkay. No, thank you for that, color Tim. It's helpful. If we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently. If we set aside China macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that Apple faces, whether that's shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple Intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is not necessarily helping replacement cycles? Just maybe double-clicking on what you think and what you're hearing in China as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:25:25PM\n\nYeah, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. Over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. Of course, on the Apple Intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China. As we just talked about, we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. Of course, it's the most competitive market in the world, and so all of those things are true.\nIn terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on 20 January 2024. It does cover the categories that we have products in, from smartphones to tablets, PCs, and smartwatches, up to a certain maximum price point. We do see fiscal stimulus occurring, and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.\n\nEric Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:26:56PM\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:26:59PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:26:59PM\n\nThank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:27:05PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:27:10PM\n\nHey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Hey, Tim, wanted to ask you, you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute. I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the deep seek situation and if you are going to, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:27:52PM\n\nSure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. That's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud, which mimics from an architectural point of view what happens on device. From a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure, and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:28:45PM\n\nWell, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. Just with regard to the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future, or do you feel that the current lineup kind of shows where you're going? I guess, without pulling punches, wondering if you thought in terms of the phone innovation, if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:30PM\n\nI think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come, and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:29:44PM\n\nThanks a lot, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:45PM\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:48PM\n\nThank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:29:53PM\n\nOur next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:59PM\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to. Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:30:25PM\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well. If you look at the 16 compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, this is across now two quarters, from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.\nI think you can conclude from that that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. In the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. Lots of great. Thank you, Tim. That's. Yeah. Lots of good color there.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:31:20PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Tim. That's very clear. I had one about the iPad Pro M4, the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall, and what did your kind of market and consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:31:48PM\n\nIt's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter, and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry-level iPad than it was the top-level iPad. Overall, we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. Probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. That tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:32:39PM\n\nThank you very much, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:32:40PM\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:32:42PM\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:32:47PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:32:57PM\n\nYep. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products. Can you just, at a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? Do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that they can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:33:21PM\n\nWe have great results in a number of emerging markets. As you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter, and we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. Also, the iPhone was the top-selling model in India for the quarter.\nIt's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets. There's a huge market, and we have very modest share in these markets. I think there's lots of upside there. That's just one of the emerging markets.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:34:12PM\n\nYeah. Tim, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets, we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. That's also an encouraging sign.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:34:25PM\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margins flatter on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points or so sequentially. Can we just touch on what are the offsets or the percentages you hear on gross margins? Kevan, maybe you can just talk about is FX having an outsized impact on your margin profile as well in March?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:34:50PM\n\nYes, Amit. Let me take that one. As we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. We think we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always percent takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect our revenue growth as well. It'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. We think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for our products business, we do have a loss of leverage.\nThere are some percent takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:35:38PM\n\nThanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:35:44PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:35:50PM\n\nYes. Thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions, do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? Given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess, in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular? I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:36:19PM\n\nYeah. I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, on a worldwide basis, we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position. In China, my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. Part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. We ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:37:14PM\n\nOkay. That's very clear. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:40:56PM\n\nThank you.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:37:17PM\n\nMaybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong, and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. How should investors think about maybe either a top-line or margin headwind that, let's say, you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:37:46PM\n\nYeah, I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that our services business set an all-time record for the December quarter, up 14%. That was one strength that we saw across all geographic segments, and also it was a very broad base across all of our services. We have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio, and we do see good momentum across the board.\nWe continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now a billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:41:40PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:38:41PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:38:48PM\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both, and I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines. More interested are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation around AI PCs? How are you thinking about the impact there? I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:39:20PM\n\nYeah. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16%, and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by a very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter, and the continued success of the MacBook Air. As you know, we launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac, and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads.\nThe silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:40:32PM\n\nOkay. Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of more diversification of the supply chain, and how should we sort of think about that strategy relative to that particular country? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:40:58PM\n\nYeah. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market and we export. Our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in-country. That really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:41:33PM\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:41:37PM\n\nYeah. Thanks.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:41:40PM\n\nThank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:41:45PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:41:51PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. When I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, it kind of feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year. How do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively, really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years?\nWhen I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been an incredibly successful quarter, just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:42:48PM\n\nYeah. If you look at Apple Intelligence, my point earlier was that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. That gives us, it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. The other thing I would say that I think I mentioned earlier is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April, so it will be in our Q3 quarter. I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:43:59PM\n\nYep. Great. Hi, David. How are you? On the services gross margin, I think maybe we step back a second. Services business in general is aggregated as creative to the overall company margin. One of the things, as an important reminder, is we have a very broad services portfolio, and those businesses have very different margin profiles. I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. One of the big factors that drives the services gross margins is the relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio.\nWe also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud that are actually growing. There, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. In general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint at 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:45:01PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:45:05PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:45:10PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:45:16PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for doing my question. I also have two of them. One, the first one for Tim, you had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:45:36PM\n\nI do not know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling. The M4-based products are so compelling that it is driving both upgrades at the double-digit level, and it is driving switchers at a double-digit level. We are seeing both come out, and I think it is just because of the compelling products.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:46:10PM\n\nGot it. Got it. Thanks to Tim. A follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you more on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year-ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin, or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:46:45PM\n\nYeah. Thanks, Krish, for the question. On the product side, as you mentioned, we had a pretty strong sequential improvement through interbasis points for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin for products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have.\nDifferent products do have different margin profiles, and that mix does make a difference. In particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mixes across phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. We're continuing to see that trend that impacted us in the December quarter. I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint, and we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. That's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave of 46.5% to 47.5%.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:48:01PM\n\nThanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:48:06PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:48:14PM\n\nOur next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:48:20PM\n\nThanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess, do you see this simply as a question of time, i.e., to launch more markets and languages, or increase the percentage of installed-based devices that can support it? Is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? Based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:48:54PM\n\nI do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. Keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. As that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get hundreds of emails a day, and the summarization function is so important. I think it's a combination of that. Of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and the base grows further.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:49:58PM\n\nOkay. Thank you. Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. Taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlock potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?\n\nKevan Parekh\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:50:27PM\n\nYeah. It's a good question. I think, one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what's served us pretty well to now. I mean, we always take into consideration looking at short-term comparisons between the short-term and the long-term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:50:48PM\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:50:53PM\n\nThank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:50:59PM\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:51:04PM\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product or consumer demand under Trump 2.0? You guys did fine under Trump 1.0.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:20PM\n\nWe are monitoring the situation and do not have anything more to add than that.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:51:29PM\n\nGreat. Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded Siri expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced on Apple Intelligence?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:50PM\n\nI think the killer feature is different for different people. I think for most, they are going to find that they are going to use many of the features every day. Certainly, one of those is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:52:16PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:52:22PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?\n\nOperator\n\n5:52:28PM\n\nOur last question is from Ben Bolin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Bolin\n\nAnalyst, Cleveland Research Company\n\n5:52:35PM\n\nGood evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts in how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. In particular, curious if you look at the strength you saw in Fiscal 2021 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:53:02PM\n\nYeah. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean, you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology, that upgrade very frequently. You have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. Most people are between those two points. I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company for more than one of the product categories.\n\nBen Bolin\n\nAnalyst, Cleveland Research Company\n\n5:53:55PM\n\nThat's it for me. Thanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:53:56PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:54:08PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ben.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:01:57PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago, and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. We set an all-time revenue record in services, which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and machine learning.\nIt will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to Image Playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data, and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud while protecting users' information, powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence, and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives.\nWe will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100ft screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps, and one and a half million compatible apps for visionOS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more.\nWe've seen great interest for Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We're doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail on our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. We are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before.\nThis update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus. Small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI.\nEvery Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020 is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with macOS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises, so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13in iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, video editors and musicians can take advantage of the cutting-edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro.\nWe're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models, powered by the M series of Apple silicon, will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications, to walking steadiness, to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work.\nAs I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion, with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories, with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigator starring Matt Damon. We can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, our best-ever showing for the upcoming awards event.\nDuring the quarter, we also expanded tap-to-pay on iPhone to more markets, including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. We announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US National Park hikes and custom walk routes in Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first-ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment.\nElsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro in demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. In honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie tasks to a user's voice. We are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users.\nWith everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. We are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. We continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation.\nWe are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:13:52PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets, and a June quarter record in emerging markets.\nCompany gross margin was 46.3%, near the high end of our guidance range, and down 30 basis points sequentially, driven by a different mix within products, which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74%, down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion, we are at the low end of the guidance range we provided, and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion. Diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year, and set a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong, at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.\niPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip.\nWe saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. Customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities, and much more. The iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US.\nWearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro 2, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high. The latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 97% for Watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services as the growth of our installed base of active devices sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem.\nWe see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We're constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services, from critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+, to new games on Apple Arcade, and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers.\nUSAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind, which will have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter.\nWe expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OPEX to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OINE to be around $-50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on 15 August 2024 to shareholders of record as of 12 August 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:23:11PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:23:23PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:23:31PM\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe, Tim, if we start with you. I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. Just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter a new iPhone cycle? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:24:03PM\n\nYes. Hi, Erik. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter, so we were very happy about that. iPhone, in general, grew in constant currency. The 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. That's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we're very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users, and we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:25:06PM\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. Second to that, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare. That came on the back of some iPhone discounting. Can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole, how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward? Thanks so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:25:39PM\n\nYeah. Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. If you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. Over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency-related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also, in mainland China, set a June quarter record for upgraders. That's a very strong signal. In fact, from Kantar, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in Urban China.\nIf you look at one of the things we look at, it is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. This goes all the way back to September 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. Those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. If you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in mainland China, the majority of customers buying are buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time. The Watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time.\nDuring the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China as it did around the world. We continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long term.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:27:08PM\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:28:04PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:28:04PM\n\nThank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:28:04PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:28:10PM\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, now that you've launched or announced Apple Intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services? Do you feel like it'll accelerate your services business, augment it, and maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things? How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for services into next year? I have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:28:40PM\n\nWe started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers. Some of the features are out there as of Monday, and we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. We're taking this first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:29:15PM\n\nOkay. Thanks. Luca, with regard to gross margin, there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you're managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:41PM\n\nSure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially. It was really driven by a different mix within products. Of course, we launched a very important product like the iPad during the course of the quarter. We had an offset from a shift in mix towards services, and we got some good cost savings. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. Keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us.\nAs we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again, similar dynamics. We expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that's what you're referring to. Yes, we've seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. In general, we feel we're well-positioned. As you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us, and we're pleased where we are.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:30:48PM\n\nOkay, thanks a lot.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:31:35PM\n\nThank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:31:35PM\n\nOur next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:31:46PM\n\nHi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence-enabled phones.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:31:46PM\n\nWe just announced sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. We had very limited time during the quarter, so it's really too early to tell.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:32:27PM\n\nThat's fair. With the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle, or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:32:57PM\n\nWe are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings. It's another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the carriers themselves to answer. I believe it will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:32:57PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:34:08PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:33:26PM\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:33:31PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:33:38PM\n\nYep. Good afternoon, everyone, and to you as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's going to be a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you touch on do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? If they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:34:08PM\n\nThe rollout, as we mentioned in June, we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year. There are other features that will happen over the course of the year. ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. Yes, it is a staggered launch.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:34:08PM\n\nGot it. I guess your services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and seem like it's accelerated recently. Can you just talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the install-based growth versus better RPU or better monetization of the install base? How do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:35:16PM\n\nYes. I mean, Luca, it's a combination of a number of factors. The install-based growth is very important, of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our services. We are seeing, and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now, continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem, both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters now. We look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they're growing strong double digits as well. Obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an RPU standpoint, and just a volume standpoint.\nObviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launch new services over time. We've launched many new services fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new: Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. We're providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. We believe we're doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We're launching new shows, new games all the time. I think you will continue to see that as we go forward.\nWe're very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. In spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:37:44PM\n\nThanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:37:44PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:37:55PM\n\nYes, thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners, but obviously, they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive install base? In the long term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part, the services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time, or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? I will follow up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:38:41PM\n\nI think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the private cloud compute. A lot of that will be things with a personal context. For world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially. That will be focused on world knowledge, as I said. The monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they're confidential between the parties. I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:39:39PM\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tim. As a follow-up, maybe for Luca, just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again, if I look at calendar 2023, you had on average a 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024, so far, we've been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind—I mean, there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. Ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:39:59PM\n\nYeah. Of course, as you said, foreign exchange continues to be—this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. It is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures, but it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the products business, our products have different margins profiles. Depending on their relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. The mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? We need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad, and that is one of the factors. We want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace.\nThat's why we always look at gross margin dollars as a first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact, is the state of the commodity markets. They tend to go in cycles, so we'll see how that plays out over time. In general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we're in a good position there.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:42:04PM\n\nThanks, Luca.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:42:04PM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:42:04PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:42:04PM\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong whistles. The first one for Luca or Tim, we keep hearing about this increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. Also, I think, Luca, you spoke about increasing commodity costs. I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? I have a quick follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:42:36PM\n\nMaybe I'll take the second one first, then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements, and there are silicon requirements. From an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence, and the successor products, obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. The iPad is the same, so it starts with the M series of silicon. There are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:43:37PM\n\nFrom a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter. We just provide the guidance for the quarter of 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. We take it quarter by quarter, and we will report as the time goes by.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:44:05PM\n\nGot it. Very helpful. A quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about it being China. I think, Tim, you said half the weakness was FX-related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was it more China macro-related, or do you think it is kind of specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:44:32PM\n\nWell, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before, and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. We were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:44:05PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:47:04PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:49:15PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:49:15PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:45:19PM\n\nGreat. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it's early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. When you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think Apple developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of, are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:45:54PM\n\nIf you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. We've thought about it from notes to mail to messages, and all the rest. There's been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. That's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user and in a way that will, I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. I think it's profound. We'll see what the developers do, but we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing. Yeah.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:47:05PM\n\nYeah. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Luca, just maybe I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. If I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit, you're effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter of last year ahead of a product launch. I'm just trying to get a sense for what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook, particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward. Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:47:41PM\n\nWell, we have provided—let me repeat what we provided. We think that we're going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the +5%, right, in spite of the fact that we're going to have some foreign exchange headwinds. We said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. We said that we will grow services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there's a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here.\nKeep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenge in compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. Also, on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly, we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air, and the iPad Pro. Important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:49:15PM\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:49:15PM\n\nThank you, David. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:49:15PM\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:49:27PM\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is, in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. Are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18, or should we be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:50:09PM\n\nOur objective that we set in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall, that's to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. We sort of gave a timeframe that, and we're tracking to that.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:50:49PM\n\nUnderstand it. The next one for Luca. Luca, the services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rule?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:00PM\n\nWell, as you know, we've introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. We have seen a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are, on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It's obviously early stage. In general, our results for the services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again, to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:52:07PM\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:52:07PM\n\nThank you, Atif. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:52:07PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:52:12PM\n\nYep. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There's a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you're aiming for, and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular, like EU and maybe China? In terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? How should we think about timing then, including that? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:52:24PM\n\nWe're engaged, as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. Our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously, because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. We're very constructively engaged with both.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:53:27PM\n\nOkay. Got it. A quick one on the wearables category. Luca, I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of which categories drove the acceleration, because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. Just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:53:51PM\n\nYeah. I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the wearables, home, and accessory categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. We've been running that for a few quarters, and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE, and the very first Watch Ultra. It's important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however, and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, the wearables, home, and accessory business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:59:07PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:54:51PM\n\nThank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:54:58PM\n\nOur last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:55:05PM\n\nThanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? Is it even possible to forecast the services usage as they roll out given that they're so new for consumers? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:55:33PM\n\nClearly, we have increased R&D over time. We've been investing in AI and ML for years. In addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. The growth sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here is it's increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it's important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach where we do things internally, and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. Yes, I mean, you can expect that we will continue to invest and increase it year on year.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:56:35PM\n\nOkay. Maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they're up materially. Given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the services mix or cost controls is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:56:55PM\n\nYeah. I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's the combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top line helps. The margin expansion that we've had over the last several years, and several quarters, obviously, has helped. That is driving better operating cash flow on the CapEx front. As Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet, and some other investments show up somewhere else, and we pay as we go. In general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing.\nWe're pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:58:13PM\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:58:15PM\n\nThank you, Richard.

We do appreciate your participation.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\n6:00:29PM\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't for today.

My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:02:00PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions, including, among others, March quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East, Canada, India, Spain, and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.\nWe estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro, and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes, and they share their amazement, and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market.\nFor example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that were not possible before. This is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. Next month, we have our worldwide developers conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\nWe believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment, and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year over year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier.\nHowever, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including mainland China, and according to Kantar, during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. Just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac, March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air.\nThe world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI, with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and its even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year over year due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power, and performance. For video editors, music makers, and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet.\nAcross wearables, home, and accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our Watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine learning to power life-saving features like irregular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones, and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in Services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year over year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments.\nAudiences are tuning in on screens large, small, and spatial, and are enjoying Apple TV+ originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. We have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolfs, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats, and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continue to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold.\nAcross the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with the profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and leave the world better than we found it. Whether we're making Apple Podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature, or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing, our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet.\nSince 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. We're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the US and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. We're working with partners in India and the US to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most, with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our restore fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects.\nLast month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams, and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:12:26PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. Thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty, and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage.\nProducts gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided, and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.53 in a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year.\nOur iPhone active install base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, urban China, Australia, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan. The iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. Our Mac install base reached an all-time high, with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac.\nCustomer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2, iPad Pro, and iPad 10th generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad install base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high, as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra.\nApple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. Customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the US. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year, with our install base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business, as we continue to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth.\nWe have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services, from creating new games on Arcade, and great new shows on TV+, to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continue to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use.\nSince the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases, from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche, to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year, in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds.\nWe were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first-half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt, and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $23.5 billion through open market repurchases of 130 million Apple shares.\nGiven the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward, as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on 16 May 2024 to shareholders of record as of 13 May 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.\nWe expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low single digits year-over-year, in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double digits, at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect iPad revenue to grow double digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:22:31PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:22:39PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:22:47PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two. First, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance, the revenue outlook for low single digits growth. I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, what kind of gives you confidence around that? On the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? I just have a quick follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:23:12PM\n\nHey, Mike. It's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low single digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double digits, at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first half of our fiscal year. We've also mentioned that iPad should grow double digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad-based. Our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing. Paid accounts are growing double digits. We've seen really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. Very pleased with the way the services business is going.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:24:24PM\n\nGreat, thank you. I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 to 11 billion per year, or any changes to how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center, and facilities? Thank you very much.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:24:52PM\n\nYeah. We are all obviously very excited about the opportunity with GenAI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front, and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than $100 billion in research and development. As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners. On the manufacturing side, we purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some other cases, our suppliers make the investment. We do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity, and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.\n\nMike Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:25:12PM\n\nExcellent. Thank you very much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:25:57PM\n\nAwesome. Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:26:02PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:26:07PM\n\nHi, yes. Thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You have had to open up third-party app stores. Clearly, this poses some security risks on the one hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:26:34PM\n\nIt's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, etc. We're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. That's our focus.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:27:04PM\n\nThank you, Tim. Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step-down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix? if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines, or is this more a mix across product lines, just trying to get some color on customer behavior, given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:27:33PM\n\nOn a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into a more typical quarter. I would say primarily leverage and a different mix of products. I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories. We haven't seen anything particular.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\n5:30:01PM\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:28:11PM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. We'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:28:16PM\n\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:28:21PM\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim. You've obviously mentioned your excitement around generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology, because historically, software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. Could AI be potentially different? How could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? I have a follow-up, please. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:28:53PM\n\nI don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products, and we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. We'll be talking more about it as we go through the weeks ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:29:19PM\n\nOkay. Very fair. Thank you. Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsy's comments or question, there's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us, if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products collectively, are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help mitigate some rising costs, if at all, rising info costs, if at all? Thank you so much.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:30:09PM\n\nYes. I mean, during the last quarter, commodity costs and, in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. In general, I think it's been a period, not only this quarter, but the last several quarters, where commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities go in cycles, and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. We're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. We will try to mitigate if there are headwinds.In general, we feel, particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:31:06PM\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:31:07PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Erik. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:31:12PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:31:17PM\n\nHey, thanks for the question. Hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning? I know you've continued to be confident there in the long term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there. Thanks a lot, I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:31:47PM\n\nNow, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. The primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. If you then look at iPhone within mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. If you look at the top-selling smartphones, the top two in urban China are iPhones. While I was there, it was a great visit. We opened a new store in Shanghai, and the reception was very warm and highly energetic. I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. I maintain a great view of China in the long term.\nI don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week, but over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:33:18PM\n\nOkay. Hey, thanks, Tim. My follow-up, I want to ask this carefully, though. There's a fear out there that you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. I was wondering if you thought AI from a big picture, and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean, from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases. I was wondering if there's just a big picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate. Thanks a lot.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:34:09PM\n\nI think AI, generative AI, and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. We'll talk more about it in the coming weeks, but I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. We think that we're well-positioned.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius\n\n5:37:29PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:38:14PM\n\nYep.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:34:37PM\n\nThanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:34:42PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:34:48PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to beat the AI horse. Tim, I know you don't want to reveal a lot. I'm just kind of curious because last quarter, you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise, or is it going to be one after the other? Any color would be helpful. I have a follow-up for Luca.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:35:10PM\n\nOur focus on enterprise has been through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones, iPads, and Macs. We recently added Vision Pro to that, and we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in enterprise.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:35:59PM\n\nGot it. Very helpful. For Luca, I'm kind of curious, given the macro environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins. I'm just trying to square the circle over there. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:36:25PM\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continue to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories, and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time. We've introduced several financing solutions, from installment plans to trade-in programs that reduce the affordability threshold, and therefore, customers tend to want to buy at the top of the range. That is very valuable for us in developed markets, particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced.\nIn general, over the last several years, and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:37:29PM\n\nGot it. Thank you very much, Luca. Thanks, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:37:32PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:37:37PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:37:45PM\n\nThanks for taking my question up too as well. I guess, first off, on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash neutral target, do you think at some point Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program, or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time, and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:38:14PM\n\nYeah. Maybe it's Luca. I would say one step at a time. We have put out this target of getting to net cash neutral several years ago, and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly the last few years. As you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback. For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion. Now we're doing $110 billion. Let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. When we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:39:08PM\n\nFair enough. I figured it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to the China discussion a bit, and Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones and mainland China is really notable. Could you step back? I mean, these numbers are still declining, at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China, and then at least the annual or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro-driven or more competitive-driven over there? That would be helpful.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:39:36PM\n\nYeah. I can only tell you what we're seeing. I don't want to present myself as an economist, so I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone. iPhone in mainland China, before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier, did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well, so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is, through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. I wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. If you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class.\nWe've tried to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers. You can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. I continue to feel very optimistic.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\n5:41:30PM\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:41:20PM\n\nThanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:41:25PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:41:30PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together so you guys have them both. Luca, obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. Just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single digits again in the June quarter. If that's the case, and maybe this is for Tim, obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said, maybe outside of China? What changes sort of the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices? Because we've been in this malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? Do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward?\nIs it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:42:25PM\n\nI do see a key opportunity, as I'd mentioned before, with generative AI with all of our devices, or the vast majority of our devices. I think that if you look out, that's not within the next quarter or so. We don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic, and that's kind of how I view it. In terms of the—I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone, though, and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone, and that's how we performed in Q2.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:43:29PM\n\nYeah. David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before. This is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total, low single digits. We do expect services to grow double digits, and we expect iPad to grow double digits. For the rest, I'll let you make assumptions, and then we will report three months from now.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\n5:43:29PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in the queue.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:43:58PM\n\nThanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:44:04PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:44:10PM\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration and why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. Just curious, what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? A quick follow-up. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:44:47PM\n\nA number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. We see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business, like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records. We feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. The comps for the services business became a bit more challenging as we go through the year.\nAs I mentioned, we still expect to grow double digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:46:01PM\n\nGot it. For my follow-up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market, obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply chain or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself? Any thoughts around that would be helpful?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:46:31PM\n\nSure. We did grow strong double digits, and so we were very, very pleased with that. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market, and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there. From a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. Yes, the two things are linked from that point of view. We have both operational things going on, and we have go-to-market initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. We've been very pleased that there's a rapidly growing base of developers there.\nWe're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\n5:48:14PM\n\nGot it. Thank you. Thanks for the reply.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:44:47PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:48:18PM\n\nThank you, Samik. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:48:25PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:48:31PM\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the questions. I think I have to have two as well, like everybody else. I guess I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, what are we missing? Where do you think people are missing Apple's iPhone traction within the China market? Just at a high level, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:06PM\n\nI can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. We did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in mainland China. That's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:49:35PM\n\nOkay. As a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, quantified it in quite some time, but I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:49:50PM\n\nFor the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decrease channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. That's not unusual, and we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:50:15PM\n\nThank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:44:47PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:50:19PM\n\nThank you, Aaron. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:50:25PM\n\nOur next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:50:32PM\n\nThanks very much. I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. Is Apple approaching a point where all those other emerging markets in aggregate might cross over to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments? Maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business. I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:50:55PM\n\nI think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. When we start looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large. We're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing, and our products are really making a lot of progress in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. It is very good for us. Certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time, and the gap, as you compare it to the numbers in China, is reducing.\nHopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:52:21PM\n\nOkay. As a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was the incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. Given you're struggling to reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base, either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, or more promotions? I mean, do you feel like you need to produce those sort of margins, or is it more important to spur growth with replacement? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:52:58PM\n\nI think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle as one thing. Of course, there are economic factors as well that play in there and what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. There are a number of variables in there. We work all of those, and we price our products for the value that we're delivering. That's how we look at it.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:53:36PM\n\nIf I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that, when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood, is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. What that means, given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue outside the United States, is the demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right? That is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? We are making all the investments that are needed. Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trade-in programs, and so on. We will continue to make all those investments.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nAnalyst, Arete Research\n\n5:54:35PM\n\nOkay. Super. Thanks, guys.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:54:38PM\n\nThank you, Richard. Operator, can we take our last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:54:45PM\n\nOur next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:54:51PM\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions as well. First, for Tim, for enterprise specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? I have a follow-up for Luca.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:55:07PM\n\nThe great thing is I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top right now. The most impressive thing is that, similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise. That varies from field service to training to healthcare-related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. It's command control centers. It's an enormous number of different verticals. Our focus is on growing that ecosystem and getting more apps, and more and more enterprises engaged. The event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. We're off to a good start, I think, with enterprise.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:56:24PM\n\nGreat. Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory, etc., for the June quarter and maybe for the full year?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:56:40PM\n\nYes. We provide guidance just for the current quarter. I'll tell you about the guidance. We're guiding, again, to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. The same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.\n\nAtif Malik\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\n5:57:18PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:57:20PM\n\nThank you, Atif.

I'm not afraid. We're in a crowd, in a RMA. Are you happy now? There's nothing happened to today, so we're shut for now. Won't you tell me, baby, are you happy now? This night is cold in the kingdom. I can feel you fade away. From the kitchen to the bathroom, sink in. Your steps keep me awake. Don't cut me down, throw me out. Leave me here to waste. I once was a man with dignity and grace.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:06:13PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago, despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago, and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions, including all-time records in Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets, with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile.\nIn services, we set an all-time revenue record, with paid subscriptions growing double digits year-over-year. I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our install base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple Stores for customers in the US, with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation, and it's years ahead of anything else.\nApple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There's already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They are why we do what we do. They're why we're so inflexibly dedicated to\ngroundbreaking innovation, and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We're proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15\nand iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, dynamic island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48-megapixel camera system. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro, and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven Pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like emergency SOS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac, revenue came in at\n$7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple Silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power, along with a remarkable neural engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple Silicon for Mac: M3,\nM3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance, empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro or beating their high score in a graphics-intensive game. A favorite among students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best Pro Notebook family. iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in-one, is now faster than ever thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the\n10th-generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to device for students, creatives, and more, with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch\ntiming of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double-tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 makes it easier to answer calls, play and pause music, or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like irregular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. For the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch.\nMeanwhile, our AirPods lineup continued to be a holiday favorite. In services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter. We achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services, and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies, and sports, including Apple TV+\nhits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades, including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2,050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month.\nWe're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. We're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show featuring Usher. Turning to retail, in recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. I know our US team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives.\nWe're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop Band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do essential work through our Racial Equity and Justice initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple\nproduction. We're using more recycled materials than ever before, and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. Each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by a core belief in the transformative power of innovation. We are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:18:46PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. Second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets, with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging\nmarkets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and wearables, home, and accessories, and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total install base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of\ngrowth from the September quarter. We're very pleased with our services performance in both developed and emerging markets, with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we\nprovided, up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year, an all-time record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active install base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving the new\niPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the US. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the US and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and returned to growth despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture\nwe experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. Our Mac install base reached an all-time high, with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the US. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad install base continues to grow and is at an all-time high, with over half of the customers who\npurchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the US. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. The latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the US.\nIn services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our install base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our services business. We continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four\nyears ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services, from Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications on News Plus like The Athletic, and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Macs, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000-plus global employees a choice of\ndevices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work, and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries, such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP, have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as the new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and\nyears to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update\nto our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2% on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. In the March\nquarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 and 14.5 billion.\nWe expect OINE to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on 15 February 2024 to shareholders of record as of 12 February 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:30:28PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:30:41PM\n\nCertainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:30:49PM\n\nHey, guys. Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. Congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you, can you unpackage some of the services drivers a bit for us? Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance.\nCan you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about services growth for the March quarter, then speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter, and in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? I have a follow-up, please. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:31:29PM\n\nThanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in the Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. It was pretty broad-based geographically and very strong across all the services categories because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising, and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare.\nObviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. Paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform.\nThis is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. Obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We do not provide guidance around the different services categories, so we will provide more color when we report in three months.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:33:22PM\n\nThank you, Luca. Tim, really nice to see your install base reach a record high again against all products and GEOs. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to onboard over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation, skew to certain products, or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts? That's it for me. Thanks so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:33:54PM\n\nYes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew in revenue terms, grew strong double digits in the December quarter, and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets, like Indonesia, also hit a quarterly record. We had several regions with records, from Latin America to the Middle East. That theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well. Emerging markets, very, very important. I feel like we're doing a great job there.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:38:46PM\n\nThanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:34:57PM\n\nOur next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng [Managing Director\n\nGlobal Investment Research] (Goldman Sachs)\n\n5:35:03PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on services, just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as the December quarter, I'm just wondering why won't it be potentially faster given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra recomp? I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple I services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter. Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. I have a quick follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:35:47PM\n\nYeah. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter. Foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter, so you got a bit of a headwind there. When you look at the progression of our services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.\n\nMike Ng [Managing Director\n\nGlobal Investment Research] (Goldman Sachs)\n\n5:36:20PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Luca. My second question, it was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support the Vision Pro developer ecosystem? It was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. Any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:36:49PM\n\nYeah. Hi. We are incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks. Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really, all over the map. There are applications for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it. Of course, SAP is in so many companies that I think there will be a great opportunity for us in enterprise. We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We're obviously looking forward to tomorrow.\nThis has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. It took a whole-of-company effort to bring it this far. In terms of generative AI, which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work, not to get out in front of ourselves. We're going to hold that to this as well. We've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\n\nMike Ng [Managing Director\n\nGlobal Investment Research] (Goldman Sachs)\n\n5:38:43PM\n\nWonderful. Thank you, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:43:51PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:38:44PM\n\nThank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:38:48PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:38:57PM\n\nYes. Thank you so much. I had two questions as well. First, on iPhone, there have been concerns around replacement cycle lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15th cycle overall given what you saw in the December quarter. I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:39:19PM\n\nHi, it's Tim. We were up 6%, as we've mentioned in the opening remarks. We're happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world, with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. We set December quarter records in India and Indonesia, so really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also, importantly, set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders, and the install base hit a new all-time high consistent with our overall devices.\nThere's a lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the US and Japan, four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia. The customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, this is including some of Q4, and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. We feel very good about that. The upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:41:15PM\n\nGreat. Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro, and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions. Just wondering, how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time? Which Apple products' adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? Is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:41:56PM\n\nEach product has its own journey. I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited internally. We've gotten an incredible amount of excitement from developers, and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. We're incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the US starting tomorrow for people that want to check it out. We'll see and report the results of it in the wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product.\nThere's 5,000 patents in the product. It's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays, and significant AI and machine learning. All of the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. We're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:47:56PM\n\nThank you so much, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:47:56PM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:43:42PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Darayani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\n5:43:48PM\n\nYep. Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what are you seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, it was one of the few places that was down double digits while everything else was growing. I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and, more importantly, from a demand perspective in China.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:44:07PM\n\nYeah. If you look at iPhone in China mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in concurrency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. It was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in mainland China, and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note that you may have seen where we were the top brand for the full year and for the December quarter. There's some good news along with, obviously, we'd prefer not to contract.\n\nAmit Darayani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\n5:45:11PM\n\nFair enough. As a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? Luca, does the net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or the broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:45:35PM\n\nYeah. Let me try to answer a little bit of both, and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. These are some of the things that we announced.\nIf you think about what we've done over the years, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. We've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that people love about our ecosystem as we can. We're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the regulation. In terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. I will see what happens in March.\nYes. Amit, as Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes apply to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global App Store revenue.\n\nAmit Darayani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\n5:47:48PM\n\nPerfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:47:56PM\n\nThank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:47:56PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:48:09PM\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, as you'd imagine. I guess the first question I want to just ask and maybe unpack a little bit more just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. I'm curious, as we look forward, I guess in this last quarter, were there any kind of benefits you're seeing from just the purchase component obligations that you put in place, let's say, a year ago and now flowing through? How are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking forward?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:48:14PM\n\nYes. On the product side, and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. Obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models, and leverage, of course. It's the biggest quarter of the year for us, so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange, but net-net, obviously, very significant improvement.\nWe had very similar dynamics on the services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also in this case due to a more favorable mix. The combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9 at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:49:19PM\n\nOkay. The second question I was just going to ask, Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out to me is that your capital expenditures have actually come down this last year. I'm curious, as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for a generative AI kind of platform as we move forward, just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:50:49PM\n\nI'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said we will never underinvest in the business. We are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. We will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. We're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:51:28PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:51:28PM\n\nThanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:51:28PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:51:39PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for picking my question. Actually, the first one for Luca, a clarification on the question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue, or is that total company revenue? Along the same path, you highlighted the strong gross margins. I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, but it looks like it's going to be inflationary right now. Obviously, you've done some of the Mac conversions, the silicon conversions. I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side. Then I'll follow up for Tim.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:52:00PM\n\nYeah. The first part of the question was around, oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago, we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. Essentially, there was pent-up demand as we exited the December quarter that got fulfilled. We also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. The close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone.\nOn the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. I'll repeat what I said before. We've had good expansion over the last few quarters, and now we are guiding to 46% to 47%. That takes into account everything that is going on, which is the commodity environment, the foreign exchange situation, and, obviously, the product and services mix. The outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong. We're very happy with it.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:53:31PM\n\nThanks a lot for it, Luca. A follow-up for Tim. Tim, it's very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. Historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. Now with Vision Pro, Macs, etc., penetrating more into the enterprise, I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future. Would it still be consumer-centric, or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:53:53PM\n\nWe've really concluded that we can do both. If you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. It sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home, and they'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that.\nVision Pro, when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600-plus that have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of enterprise in a long time. I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad. Of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:54:44PM\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot, Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:59:03PM\n\nThank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:55:39PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\n5:55:45PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I have two questions as well. Tim and Luca, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call. Can you kind of maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat. You touched on China. What are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? Is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? In your view, what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the Americas, particularly in the iPhone business? On sort of, I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide.\nWhen I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back that out last quarter or I back it out this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas, as I just touched on, is a little bit softer. In China, which you cleared up earlier, how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? Do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective, or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:56:54PM\n\nLet me take the first part of your question about Americas. If you look at the US, which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in Americas, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view. The install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point.\nWhat we focus on internally a lot is the active install base, and obviously the sales over usually a cycle. We feel better about those things. If you look at who's selling what in the US, the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. Of course, the customer satisfaction in the US, as we alluded to earlier, is 99%. We feel very, very good about what our position is in the US.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:58:05PM\n\nI would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that obviously the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\n5:59:03PM\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:59:03PM\n\nThank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:59:09PM\n\nThank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n5:59:09PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China, Tim. I think last quarter, you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, you know that there's some concerns recently, and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? Wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. I just have a quick follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:59:37PM\n\nBen, we've been in China for 30 years, and I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. I feel good about hitting a new install base number, a high watermark, and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n6:00:17PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tim. In terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps, and that it's something you guys can take advantage of?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n6:00:17PM\n\nLet me just say that I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. Without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n6:00:53PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n6:00:53PM\n\nYep. Thanks, Ben.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n6:00:58PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Ben.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n6:00:53PM\n\nA replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

We do appreciate your participation.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\n6:02:57PM\n\nThis night is cold in the kingdom. I can feel you fade away. From the kitchen to the bathroom sinking, your steps keep me awake. Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste. I once was a man, this dignity and grace. Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace. Please, please, could you find a way to let me down slowly? A little sympathy, I hope you can show me. If you want to go, then I'll be so lonely. If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly. Let me down, down, let me down, down. Let me down, let me down, down. Let me down, down, let me down. If you want to go, then I'll be so lonely. If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly. I hold on to little pieces of what we\nwere. I know we're long gone, but take it easy because it hurts. Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste. I once was a girl with dignity and grace. Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace. Please, please, could you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nCONTACT SALES\n"

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:01:17PM\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:02:34PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam, and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and an all-time record in India.\nIn services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth, and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds, and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. We've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way.\nThat includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now, let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras, and the intuitive dynamic island.\nPowered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone 15 Pro lineup has a beautiful, strong, and durable titanium design, and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family, and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago.\nEarlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple Silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips: M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace, and our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. According to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac.\nWe couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad, revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets, and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life while giving students a window into the world around them. In artist workshops, design studios, and everywhere else creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas further than they ever could before.\nAcross wearables, home, and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives, and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double-tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand, and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.\nApple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new FaceTime features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving.\nServices revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as a September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day.\nApple TV+ continues to delight customers as well. With new and returning shows like The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, and Monarch, we're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+, and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations, and nearly 400 wins.\nWe also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home the MLS Cup. Nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers.\nWe welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China, and the UK, and expanded the Apple Store online to Vietnam and Chile. We have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple 5th Avenue on launch day, and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with a customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories to life-saving features like emergency SOS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small.\nWhether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise: the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it, and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part.\nOur first-ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone, and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon-neutral by the end of the decade. We're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third Impact Accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.\nApple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense of possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers, and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. That's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:13:12PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points, and on a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas, and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on.\nAt the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter.\nOur performance in services was broad-based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nServices gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter, due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion. Diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and a new September quarter record.\nWe had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India, and September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. Our iPhone active install base grew to a new all-time high, and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switchers. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the US.\nMac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing, with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year.\nWe have great confidence in our Mac lineup, and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our install base is at an all-time high, and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the US. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year.\nSimilar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the install base, with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. The latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the US. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.\nWe had a September quarter record in Europe, and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach, with nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for the watch was recently measured at 97% in the US. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year.\nWe're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. We continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth.\nWe have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services, from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love these new offerings. Turning to enterprise, we are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.\nStarbucks continues to invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations, and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. In Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive.\nToday, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares.\nWe also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant currency basis despite a volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter.\nWe are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets, with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023, and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets, from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. We continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets, and the opportunity ahead of us.\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1%. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks.\nFor clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week. We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter.\nWe expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad, and wearables, home, and accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the wearables category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro (second generation), the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.\nWe expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 and 14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around -$200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on 16 November 2023 to shareholders of record as of 13 November 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:25:25PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:25:34PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:25:41PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have a question on iPhone storage and demand versus iCloud. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix shift towards higher storage iPhone models, or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of iCloud Plus? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here, and trade-offs as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus iCloud penetration? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:26:16PM\n\nMichael, it's Tim. As you probably know, we started the line with the iPhone Pro Max at $256, and we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant changes.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:26:42PM\n\nThank you. As a separate follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops, anything in color that you can share regarding the timing of the M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the M2 earlier in the calendar year. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:27:04PM\n\nYeah, we're thrilled to have announced the M3 lineup and get the new MacBook Pro and the new iMac out there. We couldn't be more excited about it. As Luca said, with the lineup that we've got and the compare issue that we don't have during Q1, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the Mac space for Q1. To just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter, and that made the September quarter not only a record, but a substantial record.\nObviously, we're now comparing against that for 2023. I wouldn't look at the -$34 as representative of the underlying business performance is sort of the nut of it.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:28:24PM\n\nExcellent. That's very clear. Thank you, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:28:21PM\n\nYeah.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:28:24PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:28:32PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:28:38PM\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I'm curious, Tim, if you could help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like. How has the reception been to the iPhone 15? Kind of similar question to the prior one, how would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle? I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:29:02PM\n\nYeah, if you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in on a revenue basis -2%. One thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. We grew in constant currency. Underneath that, if you look at the different categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in mainland China. What pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter. The Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of 2022.\nIn addition to that, we had the top four selling phones in urban China for last year. I took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers, employees, and others.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:30:28PM\n\nYep. As a quick follow-up, I'm curious as we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment, Luca, how do we think about that effect or how you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level as maybe component pricing starts to turn what's been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment? Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:31:01PM\n\nWell, as you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin. The 45.2% was a record for the September quarter, and the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45% to 46. Our gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. Equally important is the mix of what we sell. Obviously, growth in services for us is favorable, and that has helped our company gross margin.\nForeign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for several quarters given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products. We feel very good, very confident about this coming year, and I think the gross margin guidance reflects that.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\n5:32:17PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:32:24PM\n\nThanks, Aaron. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:32:28PM\n\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:32:34PM\n\nAwesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Maybe if I start, Luca. I know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are constrained today, but I think some of your comments suggest you should be back to supply-demand balance before quarter end. I guess my question is, does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? If so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:33:03PM\n\nYes, it's correct. We are constrained today on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply-demand balance by the end of the quarter. The guidance reflects that.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:33:29PM\n\nOkay. Very clear. Thanks. Maybe for you and Tim, you guys have been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon, and services. I'm sure there's plenty of technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year 2024, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue had been relatively low compared to the eight years prior? Should we expect a step up or kind of similar capital intensity? What are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:34:09PM\n\nWell, the big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants, our investments in data centers, and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. For the tooling in our plants and our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners and suppliers. Maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability. Over the last few years, we made all the investments that we needed to make. Obviously, we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:35:03PM\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the color, guys.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:35:06PM\n\nThanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:35:10PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\n5:35:15PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I know you cover China. I want to pivot to the US for a second. Obviously, iPhone and the business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter, but it's still relatively softer, kind of where I thought it would be at this point in the cycle. Some of the US carriers, obviously, haven't been that particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. Just wanted to kind of get a sense first, what you're seeing from your partners in the US kind of currently and going forward, and what do you expect?\nSecond, Luca, on the margins, I mean, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margins? Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:36:08PM\n\nOn the US carriers and the US business in general, it's really too early to call the iPhone cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and the Pro Max. The US tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:36:41PM\n\nOn the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually December is the quarter where our products business tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. The services gross margins that are accretive to total company have an impact, but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year. I think that the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs and improved mix on the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\n5:37:32PM\n\nGot it. The weakness in iPad and wearables are less of an impact on sort of the margin trajectory in the December quarter?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:37:34PM\n\nThat's correct. That's correct.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\n5:37:36PM\n\nGot it. Thanks, Luca.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:37:44PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. We'll take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:37:43PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:37:56PM\n\nYep. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess first off, just the services growth rate. There was a tremendous acceleration, I think, in September quarter to 16% growth. It sounds like it's going to hold there pretty well into December. Can you just talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have just stepped up in a very meaningful way? Just maybe flush out what is driving this acceleration, because it's fairly notable compared to what you've been seeing in the last few quarters.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:38:20PM\n\nWe had a really strong quarter across the board, Amit, because both geographically and from a product category standpoint, we saw very significant growth. I mentioned the records on a geographic basis. From a category standpoint, literally, we set records in each one of the big categories. We had an all-time record for App Store, for advertising, for cloud, video, AppleCare, payments, and a September quarter record for music. It's hard to pick one in particular because they all did well. Really, then we step back and we think about why is it that our services business is doing well?\nIt's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice pace, and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, more paid accounts, and more subscriptions on the platform. We continue to add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. It's a combination of all these things, and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every service category.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:39:57PM\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. Maybe if I could ask you about Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024 in the early part of the year. I'm curious, how different do you think the launch and the consumer education of this product or a new category will be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done? Perhaps any themes that stood out to you from the developers that have been able to use this in the developer labs, what feedback have you gotten from them?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:40:23PM\n\nYeah, that's a great question. There's a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro. We've been very happy to share it with developers. We have developer labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps. I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those, and there's some real blow-away kinds of things that are coming out. That all looks good. To answer your question about is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch, I would say no.\nThere's never been a product like the Vision Pro, and we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores, and it'll be a very different process than a normal grab-and-go kind of process.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:41:32PM\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:41:39PM\n\nThanks, Amit. We'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:41:44PM\n\nOur next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:41:50PM\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks for the question, and congratulations on tremendous execution in a very tough macro. Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. Lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segues into the provision that you have. I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:42:22PM\n\nIf you kind of zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. Just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like personal voice and live voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. You can go all the way to life-saving features on the watch and the phone, like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. We don't label them as such, if you will.\nWe label them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is because, as you know, we really don't do that. You can bet that we're investing. We're investing quite a bit. We're going to do it responsibly, and you will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:43:53PM\n\nThanks, Tim. Very clear. For my follow-up, I had a philosophical question. You guys always try to provide the best experience for consumers. To that end, I think over the last decade, you've insourced a lot of important chips in your phones, your Macs, iPads, so on and so forth. That was, I think, a function that Arm wasn't around in the industry from a merchant angle. Now we see the silicon guys, the chip guys, moving to Arm architecture. My question to you is, has the move to internal silicon been an economically profitable proposition for Apple? Is it a strategic one where you simply need to own this and it's vital to your products for the consumer experience?\nMaybe there's a path back to chip vendors at some point in time?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:44:46PM\n\nIt's really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. As you know, we like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship. Arguably, the silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies. No, I don't see going back. I am happier today than I was yesterday, than I was last week that we've made the transition that we've made. I see the benefit every day of it.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:45:18PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:45:18PM\n\nYep.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:45:26PM\n\nThank you, Harsh. We'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:45:31PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:45:39PM\n\nYes, thank you so much. Tim, over the last decade, pretty much, you've gained a lot of share in China. As you look here, some of the domestic players are starting to re-emerge, especially in the high-end phone space. I know you touched on China, how would you see Apple's positioning and opportunity for continued share gains, particularly in China? How was the linearity in China from a demand perspective? I have a follow-up, please.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:46:06PM\n\nIn the September quarter, we set an iPhone revenue record in China. We're very proud of that, and we obviously grew. The market predictions that I've seen would have the market contracting. If those are correct, then we gained share last quarter, and we're very proud of that. I don't know what every quarter will hold. Obviously, we just give a bit of color on the current quarter, but over the long term, I view China as an incredibly important market, and I'm very optimistic about it.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:46:52PM\n\nThanks, Tim. As a follow-up, you obviously had a great services quarter. Part of your services business has these licensing relationships with search partners where you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options maybe Apple has to mitigate some of the risk given some of the scrutiny on with some of these search partners? Thank you so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:47:26PM\n\nThey are important relationships. As you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call. I see them as important, and we make decisions that are in the best interests of our users or what we feel is in the best interests of our users. That's kind of what we've done in the past and how we run the show in the future as well.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\n5:47:53PM\n\nOkay. Thank you, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:48:01PM\n\nThank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:48:07PM\n\nOur next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:48:07PM\n\nHi. Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Luca, thanks for the color on gross margin. I look at it over the last four quarters, even if on a year-over-year basis, revenue declined, the gross margins have improved. I understand services definitely helps. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at a go-forward basis, are most of the big step functions and cost reductions, like the Mac silicon conversion, etc., that are done, or is there more room for margin expansion from here? I had a follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:48:46PM\n\nWell, on the product side, as you know, when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It happens because we're always adding new technologies, new features, and then we work through the cost curve over the lifecycle of the product, and we tend to get benefits as time goes by. The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that. We're starting from a better position than a year ago or than in the past in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile.\nOur guidance, our results are reflective of that. Also, within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles. I think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trading options, and low-cost financing in general. What that has accomplished is reduce the affordability threshold for our customers, and therefore, they can buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion.\nWe don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there are so many different variables that affect gross margins. We obviously feel very good about the trajectory that we've had in 2023, and now the guidance that we provide for the beginning of our fiscal 2024. We need some of these things because, obviously, the foreign exchange environment has been difficult and has been a bit of a drag for us. Net-net, we're very pleased where we are.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:51:00PM\n\nGot it. Thanks for that, Luca. A follow-up for Tim. Obviously, we're seeing amazing momentum in India. I'm just kind of curious, how do you look at when you look at the India growth opportunity on these hardware units, how to think about ASP relative to that versus the rest of the geographies? Is there a way to compare or contrast India growth momentum versus China maybe a decade ago or so at the same point of the rollout of the share gains in that geography?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:51:44PM\n\nYeah, that's a great question. We had an all-time revenue record in India. We grew very strong, double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us, and a major focus of ours. We have low share in a large market, so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there. The ASPs, I haven't looked at them most recently, but I'm sure that they're lower than the worldwide. That doesn't bother us at all. In terms of the similarity, I would say each country has its own journey. I wouldn't want to play the comparison game. We see an extraordinary market, a lot of people moving into the middle class.\nDistribution is getting better. Lots of positives. We put two retail stores there, as you know. They're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going, but they're off to a good start. I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:53:02PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:53:11PM\n\nThank you, Krish. We'll now take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\n5:53:15PM\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n5:53:21PM\n\nHey, thanks a lot. I appreciate the question. Tim, I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there, or your optimism. I wanted to also ask about the supply chain and where is your priority? Do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain? How do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world? In particular, what do you think about further investments in the US as well?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:53:50PM\n\nOur supply chain is truly global. We're investing all over the world, including in the United States. We were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the US and have worked on a number of different projects in the US, whether it's our venture with Corning on the glass, the Face ID module, or semiconductors. All of these are advanced manufacturing, and I think exactly the kinds of things that the US would be, and are, very, very good at. We also invest in other regions of the world, and we're continually optimizing the chain. The moment we learn something that didn't work exactly right, we're tweaking it. We're going to continue to do that.\nAt the end of the day, it will still be a global supply chain.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n5:55:09PM\n\nGot it. Thanks. Next one for Luca, just really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was also last year an issue with the iPhone production where there were the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what that, I guess, having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year, what that benefit is this year, and maybe contrast that with the seven-point hit from the extra week? Thanks a lot.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:55:42PM\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Ben. I mentioned during the prepared remarks, the extra week is seven points of revenue. We did have supply disruptions last year on the phone, on the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the December quarter a year ago. When we normalize for those two factors, and I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on iPhone. You take into account the loss of the extra week, you compare it with the supply disruptions that are not going to repeat, hopefully, this year. When you normalize for those two things, we still expect to grow on iPhone.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nManaging Director and Head of Technology Research, Melius Research\n\n5:56:29PM\n\nThanks a lot, everybody. Appreciate it, Luca.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n5:56:32PM\n\nThank you, Ben. We'll take the last question now.\n\nOperator\n\n5:56:38PM\n\nOur last question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Arete Research\n\n5:56:46PM\n\nThank you very much. Tim, first off, if we look over the past two years, Apple sales are about $18 billion higher, and R&D is up by about $8 billion or over 1/3 higher. Can you give us a sense of some of the main components or drivers behind that increase in innovation spend? Is it Apple silicon? Is it new products like Vision Pro? Is it content to support new services? I think that's one of the top questions investors have. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:57:10PM\n\nSure. It's a number of things, Richard. It's some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro, it's AI and ML, it's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things. I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:57:51PM\n\nI would add, Richard, on this front, some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion. I think it's important to think about it that way.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Arete Research\n\n5:58:08PM\n\nThat's great. Luca, Tim mentioned college students choosing Macs, and you mentioned the record services revenue. What other metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures and increases customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with relatively lower-priced products or even refurbished devices? You're growing your ecosystem, but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:58:30PM\n\nWell, some of the metrics that I've mentioned before, obviously, we look at the installed base of active devices. We want to make sure that the customers that we acquire remain with us. We have good visibility over that, and we pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the installed base, both by product and by geography. We look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem. That's why we pay a lot of attention on things like transacting accounts, paid accounts. We want to see if, in fact, we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us.\nThere are all these things we keep track of, and then what we do, because I think it's really important, is that over time, we add new services. That, obviously, for example, the progress that we made in payments in recent years, is very, very important because we've attracted more and more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices, and we are able to monetize that, right? We take all that into account. We understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device. We understand their behavior in different markets, and so on.\nWe have, I think, pretty good visibility. I think the progress that we're making in services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months. That's the size of a Fortune 50, and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nFounder and Managing Director, Arete Research\n\n6:00:25PM\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks very much.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple\n\n6:00:35PM\n\nThank you, Richard.

We do appreciate your participation.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\n6:01:22PM\n\nI try to reach for the feeling. I'm scared that I'm letting you down because I'm so caught up on this feeling. This feeling. I keep falling. I'm falling. I'm falling. I'm falling down. I'm falling. I'm falling. I'm falling. I'm falling down. It ain't how I swallowed by all my sorrow in a way. I'm losing myself. I'm nowhere now. Can I stay? Because I believe that I have seen enough, and there's something that I've been dreaming of.\n\nCONTACT SALES\n"

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Saori Casey, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:02:41PM\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the\ncompany's business and the results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with ACC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they're made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:03:54PM\n\nThank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continue to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone, with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands, and Austria. We set an all-time revenue record in services, driven by more than 1 billion paid subscriptions. We continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4% of\nforeign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate, and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference. In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing. We were so pleased to share the\nrevolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before. Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple. It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers, and content creators who've had the chance to try it. We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year. Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year-ago quarter's record performance. On a constant currency\nbasis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup. iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size. With Dynamic Island, always-on display, and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever. Turning to Mac, we recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon. We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch\nMacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop, and one of the best Macs we've ever made. We launched two new powerhouses in computing: Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra, and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year. Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value. There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring.\nWith the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet. We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world.\nIn addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms. From exciting new features like live voicemail and standby in iOS 17 to new tools for users to work, play, and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features.\nIt was also an exciting quarter for services, where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected. We set an all-time revenue record for total services, and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud, and payment services. Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps, and in stores. We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay. Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the US, with award-winning\ncustomer satisfaction. This spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo, as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty. In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on\nApple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami. Just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps, and setlists from tours of major artists. These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make services more powerful, more useful, and more fun than ever. Everything we do is in service of our customers and retailers, where we bring the best of Apple.\nDuring the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there. We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tyson's Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative, and sustainable design enhancements. We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station. The performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations. With every product we create, every feature we develop, and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for.\nWe believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them. Building technology in service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right.\nThat's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari private browsing, communication safety, and lockdown mode to further safeguard our users. As part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our racial equity and justice initiative to more than $200 million. We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform work. While supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Through our environmental work, we're making strides in\nour commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products. We've long held that education is the great equalizer. With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom. Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the US to the program.\nBy the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries. As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world. From Detroit to Naples, to Riyadh, and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities.\nApple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission, and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world. Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible, and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:16:04PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year, and better than our expectations, despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in the majority of the markets we track. We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets, driven by iPhone. Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base reached an all-time\nhigh across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad, and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and grew double digits in constant currency. Our performance was strong around the world, as we reached all-time services revenue records in Americas and Europe, and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter, and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift\ntowards services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter, due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter, and decelerated from the March quarter. We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend, with strong focus on innovation and new product development. The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26,\nup 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India, and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Our iPhone active install base grew to a new all-time high thanks to a June quarter record in switchers. This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at\n98% for the iPhone 14 family in the US. Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio, and this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup. This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers. In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the US. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch\nin the prior year. At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad install base, with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. The latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the US. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China, and strong performance in several emerging markets. We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach, with about two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.\nThis is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion, with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8%, and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store, and music. We are very pleased with our performance in services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem strength. First, our install base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace, and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of\nour ecosystem. Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months, and nearly doubled the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services, from 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand new content on Apple TV+, to the\nlaunch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card. Our customers are loving these enhanced offerings. Turning to the enterprise market, our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent. Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies. Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team. Over the last six months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making\nMacBook Air available to more employees, with a focus on user experience and strong security. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares.\nWe continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2%. We expect iPhone and\nservices year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter. Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago, and we were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year-ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our\ntax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on 17 August 2023 to shareholders of record as of 14 August 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:25:49PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:25:58PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:26:05PM\n\nThank you very much. Nice to speak with you. Tim, you mentioned, and actually, Luca, too, you mentioned an uneven macro environment during the quarter several times on the call. I'm wondering if you can talk on a geographic basis about some of the trends you're seeing in iPhone. I'm specifically wondering how demand is trending within regions.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:26:27PM\n\nShannon, I'll answer it. I didn't get the end of your question. I think he has dropped. Okay. Well, let me answer the question for the part that I could follow. On a geographic basis, we've had great performance for iPhone in emerging markets. We set June quarter records in many of the emerging markets. We grew in total double digits, and the performance was strong across the board in emerging markets, from China, where our performance improved from -3% to +8% in the June quarter, and we grew double digits in constant currency to many other areas around the world, from India, where again we set a June quarter record with very strong performance there, Indonesia, Southeast Asia in general, Latin America, Middle East, and it's been really good there. Also, as you can see from our geographic segments, we had a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, primarily in the US, but we declined there because the smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters in the US.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:28:18PM\n\nThank you very much. Sorry about that. I'm not sure why I cut off.In terms of gross margin, you were at the high end of the range, and you guided to 45% at the high end, which is, I think, higher than I remember in 20 years of covering you. How should we think about the pros and cons of gross margin? It seems like there's a perfect storm of good things, so maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about it more holistically. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:28:43PM\n\nI think you remember correctly, Shannon, because the 44.5% for the June quarter is an all-time record for us in June. We were up 20 basis points sequentially. It was driven by cost savings and a mix shift towards services, which obviously helps company gross margins, partially offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. We have a commodity environment that is favorable to us.\nOur product mix is quite strong at this point. With the exception of foreign exchange, we continue to be a drag, and it was a significant drag on a year-over-year basis. Yeah, we are in a good position right now. We are in a good position for the June quarter. As I mentioned, we expect a similar level of gross margins for the same reasons, frankly, for the September quarter.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:29:47PM\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:29:50PM\n\nNext question, please.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:30:00PM\n\nOur next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:30:05PM\n\nYes, thank you so much. Luca, can you just give us a little more color around the guidance? Your overall revenue performance, you called out similar. Obviously, you absorbed a higher FX impact this quarter versus your guide, and you also noted services acceleration. Just wondering, when you think about that comment on iPhone acceleration, is that on a reported basis? Is that constant currency basis? Is there something that's changing in terms of seasonality, perhaps for you, that is causing not as much step-up in product revenue as typical on a sequential basis? I will follow up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:30:49PM\n\nYes. All our comments are in reported currency, not in constant currency, in relation to the outlook. We said acceleration sequentially for iPhone and for services, but we also pointed out—this is where I think, Wamsi, you're referring to some seasonality issues—we also said that for Mac and iPad, we expect to decline double digits. The reason for that is that we have a very difficult compare versus last year.\nYou remember that a year ago in the June quarter, we had factory shutdowns for both Mac and iPad, and we were able to fill the pent-up demand from those shutdowns during the September quarter. An unusual level of activity that we had a year ago, and now obviously the compare is difficult. We expect both iPad and Mac to be down double digits, which offset the acceleration that I mentioned for iPhone and services.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:31:57PM\n\nOkay. Thank you, Luca. Tim, I was wondering if you could update us on what percent of iPhones are sold on some type of installment basis now versus full upfront payment on a global basis, and maybe some thoughts on if you expect similar promotional activity from carriers, especially in the US, that seem to be grappling with a lot of cash flow issues this particular year. Thank you so much.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:32:23PM\n\nWamsi, I'll take it. We've done a really good job over the last few years with affordability programs around the world, directly in our direct channel, and with our partners around the world. The majority of iPhones at this point are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing. That percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets.\nWe want to do more of that because we think it really helps reduce the affordability threshold for our products, and we think it is also one of the reasons why our product mix has been very strong during the last couple of cycles. We will continue to push on that front.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:33:23PM\n\nOkay. Thank you, Luca.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:33:24PM\n\nThank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\n5:33:35PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on two points that both you, Tim, and Luca made about growth and maybe commodities. Just to be clear, I know you're talking about an acceleration in iPhone, but the comp is about two points easier from FX. I just want to understand, is that on a like-for-like basis, excluding the currency improvement of about two points from the June quarter to the September quarter?\nFrom a commodity perspective, I know last quarter you talked about buying a lot of inventory at favorable prices, which was an incredibly smart strategy. Where do you sit today, and what's sort of the timing or the duration of that commodity sort of backlog that you have as we think about next quarter and the subsequent quarters? How far does that get you out into the future from this favorable cost dynamic? Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:34:22PM\n\nLet me start again. I just want to be clear about the guidance, the outlook guidance that we provided. We're referring entirely to reported numbers, so they take into account the fact that we have a slight improvement in foreign exchange. When I talk about similar performance, I refer to reported performance in the June quarter and then the reported performance in the September quarter.\nAgain, we expect on a reported basis our iPhone performance to accelerate, our services performance to accelerate, and iPad and Mac to decline double digits. On the commodity front, as I mentioned, the environment is favorable. We always make sure that we take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the market, and we will continue to do that going forward.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\n5:35:23PM\n\nLuca, any sense on how long that gives you a runway today based on what you currently have? Give us a sense for at least the short-term tailwind.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:35:32PM\n\nI don't want to speculate past the September quarter because that's the horizon where we provide guidance. I've said that the guidance for September is 44% to 45%, which you know is historically very high, and obviously that reflects a favorable environment for us.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:35:56PM\n\nThank you, David.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\n5:35:56PM\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:40:08PM\n\nCan we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:36:00PM\n\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:36:06PM\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question as too as well. Maybe if we just start kind of big picture, Tim or Luca, I was wondering if you could just kind of share some incremental color on how you think the consumer is behaving today versus 90 days ago, and maybe how that differs by region. Meaning, are there any signs that consumers are incrementally more willing to spend on things like consumer electronics, or is there still relative caution in the market? Are there any regions where you're seeing more strength in the consumer, and how sustainable do you think some of that strength or weakness could be based on some of the KPIs you track? I will follow up. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:36:42PM\n\nYeah. Hi, David. It's Tim. If you sort of step around the world, we did exceptionally well in emerging markets last quarter, and even better on a constant currency basis. Emerging markets was a strength. If you look at China, in China, we went from a negative 3 in Q2 to a plus 8 in Q3. In China, we had an acceleration. If you look at the US, which is obviously in the Americas segment and is the vast majority of what's in there, there was also a slight acceleration sequentially, although the Americas is still declining somewhat year-over-year, as you can see on the data sheet. The primary reason for that is that it's a challenging smartphone market in the US currently. In Europe, Europe saw a record quarter for the June quarter, a record. Some really good signs in most places in the world.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:38:12PM\n\nAwesome. Thank you for that color, Tim. Maybe, Luca, a question for you. I think it's been about three quarters now where we've seen OpEx either grow below historical seasonality or come in below your expectations. I think this is the first time we've seen R&D grow less than 10% year-over-year since fiscal Q2 2007. Can you maybe just talk about some of the cost actions you're taking, and as you look forward, what are the indicators that you're really evaluating that would give you greater confidence in perhaps returning back to a more seasonal cadence of OpEx spending, or is this just a new normal that we should be expecting? That's it for me. Thanks so much.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:38:52PM\n\nObviously, we look at the environment, and we know that this has been an uncertain period for the last few quarters. We decided to be deliberate in what we do in terms of controlling our spend. There are many areas across the company that we're working on, and we've been quite effective at slowing down the spend. We slowed down also the hiring within the company in several areas, and we're very pleased with our ability to decelerate some of the\nexpense growth, taking into account the overall macro situation. We will continue to manage deliberately. You can see that we continue to grow our R&D costs faster than the rest of the company, as G&A is actually growing at a much slower pace, because obviously our focus continues to be in innovation and product development, and we continue to do that.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:40:08PM\n\nThank you, Eric. May we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:40:13PM\n\nOur next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:40:19PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, it was encouraging to see the services outperformance in the quarter, up double digits on an FX-neutral basis, and more services acceleration next quarter on a reported basis. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about key underlying drivers for the confidence in the services acceleration next quarter. I understand the FX ease a little bit. Anything to call out as it relates to things in Apple Search Ads that's helping. You're obviously making a lot of investments in Apple TV+, between MLS and the Canal+ deal. Any thoughts there would be great. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:41:02PM\n\nYes, Michael, you're correct. I mean, clearly we've seen an improvement in the June quarter, and we expect further improvement in the September quarter. In June, the performance was across the board. Tim and I mentioned we set records really across the board. We had all-time records in Cloud, in video, in AppleCare, in payments, and June quarter records in App Store, advertising, and music. We saw improvement in all our services categories. We think the situation will continue to improve as we go through September, and that's very positive because not only good for the financial results, but obviously it shows a high level of engagement of our customers in the ecosystem, which\nis very important for us. It's really the sum of all the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. It goes from the fact that our install base continues to grow, so we got a larger pool of customers, to the fact that our customers are more engaged as we have more transacting accounts and paid accounts on the ecosystem. The subscriptions business is very healthy, with growth of 150 million paid subscriptions just in the last 12 months. It's almost double what we had three years ago. Of course, we are providing more and more content to our users, and the combination of all these things gives us good confidence for September.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:42:48PM\n\nGreat, thank you very much. Just as a related follow-up, it's about the hardware install base and services RPU. I thought I was curious when you talked about the services strength, you talked about the 2 billion-plus install base. When you think about the opportunity to increase the services RPU, do you really think about it internally on a per-active iPhone user basis or on a per-device basis? Said differently, I'm just curious where you think about whether you think there's an incremental opportunity for those users that have multiple devices. Do you really see a big services RPU uplift in that respect? Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:43:29PM\n\nWe know that customers that own more than one device are typically more engaged in our ecosystem. Obviously, they tend to also spend more on the services front. I would say the biggest opportunity is that we know that there's a lot of customers that we have that are very familiar with our ecosystem. They're engaged in the ecosystem. Still today, they're using only the portion of the ecosystem that is free. We think that by offering better content and more content over time, we're going to be able to attract more of them as paid customers.\nGreat. Thank you, Luca.\nThank you, Michael. May I have the next question, please?\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\n5:44:20PM\n\nThanks for your time.I have to as well. I guess, Luca, maybe we can talk on wearables a bit. The growth over there, I think, in constant currency was fairly impressive at plus 6%. Just touch on maybe what's driving that, and then how do we think about the wearables segment heading into the September quarter? I know you talked about a bunch of other ones, but how do we think about wearables into September as well? Sorry, I didn't get the what are you referring to? Yeah. Sorry. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the wearables segment because the growth over there was fairly impressive. And then how do you think about it into September as well?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:45:06PM\n\nYeah. On the wearables front, we had really good performance in Greater China. That's, again, very important for us. It was a June quarter record for Greater China. Very important for us because, again, it shows that the engagement with the ecosystem in a market that is so important for us like China continues to grow. It means that there's more and more customers that are owning more than the iPhone. We continue to grow the install base of the category very quickly because, as I mentioned, two-thirds of every buyer of Apple Watch during the course of the June quarter was new to the product.\nThat is all additive to the install base. It's just great to see that the AirPods continue to be a great success in the marketplace for us, and things are moving in the right direction there. It's become a very large business for us. In wearables, home, and accessories, the last 12 months, we've done $40 billion of business, which is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 company. It's become very important, and it's allowed us to diversify both our revenues and our earnings.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\n5:46:22PM\n\nThat's really helpful. If I could just follow up, the growth in Europe at up 5% is fairly notable as well. I think you have a few emerging markets that you put in Europe as well, but I would love to understand what's happening in Europe and if there's a way to think about sort of Western Europe or developed world versus emerging markets over there. Thank you.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:46:51PM\n\nYeah. It's been very good, primarily on the emerging market side of Europe. We include India and the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe into the Europe segment. As we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we had a number of markets that did very well, like France, like Italy, the Netherlands, Austria. It was a good quarter for Europe.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:47:16PM\n\nThank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:47:22PM\n\nOur next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:47:27PM\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I had one for Luca and then later on one for Tim. Luca, for some time now, for many quarters, you've had a currency headwind, a foreign exchange currency headwind. It's conceivable that as rates start to come down, hopefully next year, that the dollar weakens. Could you take us to the mechanism of how that will work on your revenues and for your costs?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple\n\n5:48:02PM\n\nWe try to hedge our foreign exchange exposures because we think it's the right approach for the company in terms of minimizing the volatility that necessarily happens from the movements of currencies. We cannot effectively hedge every single exposure around the world because in some cases, it is not possible. In other cases, it is prohibitively expensive. We tend to cover all the major currency pairs that we have. About 60% of our business is outside the United States.\nIt's a very, very large, and I would say very effective hedging program. We set up these hedges, and they tend to roll over very regularly, and then we replace them with new hedges at the new spot rate. The impact that we're going to have on revenue and cost will depend on where the spot rates are at different points in time. Therefore, because of the way the program works, there tends to be a bit of a lag in both directions as the foreign exchange moves over time.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:49:26PM\n\nUnderstood. Very helpful. For Tim, historically, for the last many years, carriers in at least the US, which I think is your largest market for iPhone, have had programs to help folks upgrade, whether they give a cash rebate or you bring in your old phone, something like that. I was curious, as you get into your peak December quarter, if you're aware if these programs are in place. The reason why I'm asking is I think earlier you mentioned that more than 50% of your phones are sold through some kind of program. I assume the number is even higher in the US.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:50:03PM\n\nI don't want to get into revealing specifics in the different carriers, but generally speaking, I would think that it would be quite easy to find a promotion on a phone provided you're hooking up to a service and either switching services, carriers, or upgrading your phone at the same carrier. I think both of those cases today that you can find promotions out there, and I would expect that you'd be able to do that in the December timeframe as well.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:50:47PM\n\nVery well. Thank you.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:50:47PM\n\nThank you, Harsh. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:50:53PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\n5:50:57PM\n\nYeah. Thank you for letting me ask a question. I have two as well. First of all, I just want to kind of ask Tim strategically, as we think about the services growth and kind of the content expansion behind that, I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate what you've seen from a sporting perspective in terms of the engagement with MLS, the engagement with Major League Baseball, and how strategically you're thinking about expansion in sports as a key driver of services growth going forward.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:51:29PM\n\nWe're focused on original content, as you know, with TV+. We're all about giving great storytellers the venue to tell great stories, and hopefully get us all to think a little deeper. Sport is a part of that because sport is the ultimate original story. For MLS, we could not be happier with how the partnership is going. It's clearly in the early days, but we're beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit. We're very excited about it.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\n5:52:25PM\n\nYep. Thank you. As a quick follow-up, I'm just curious of an update on you mentioned in your prepared remarks the continued growth that you've seen in India. I'm curious of how we think about that market opportunity looking forward. Is there anything that you see evolving that could accelerate the opportunity for iPhone in that large mobile market?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:52:46PM\n\nWe did hit a June quarter revenue record in India, and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first two retail stores during the quarter. Of course, it's early going currently, but they're currently beating our expectation in terms of how they're doing.\nWe continue to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in our direct-to-consumer offers as well. I think if you look at it, it's the second largest smartphone market in the world. We ought to be doing really well there, and we're really pleased with our growth there. We still have a very, very modest and low share in the smartphone market. I think that it's a huge opportunity for us, and we're putting all of our energies in making that occur.\n\nSaori Casey\n\nVP of Finance, Apple\n\n5:53:58PM\n\nThank you, Aaron. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:54:02PM\n\nOur next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSidney Ho\n\nSenior Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\n5:54:12PM\n\nThank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the AI side of things. Your strategy on AI seems quite different than many of your peers. At least you don't talk too much about how much you invest in it. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. Related to that, how do you see your investment in this area turning into financial performance in the future? Is it mainly through faster upgrade cycle, maybe higher ASP, or are you thinking about maybe additional services that you can capitalize on that? I'll follow up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:54:43PM\n\nIf you take a step back, we view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build. If you think about WWDC in June, we announced some features that will be coming in iOS 17 this fall, like personal voice and live voicemail. Previously, we had announced life-saving features like fall detection, crash detection, and ECG. None of these features that I just mentioned, and many, many more, would be possible without AI and machine learning. It's absolutely critical to us.\nOf course, we've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI, for years. We're going to continue investing, innovating, and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies, with the goal of enriching people's lives. That's what it's all about for us. As you know, we tend to announce things as they come to market. That's our MO, and I'd like to stick to that.\n\nSidney Ho\n\nSenior Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\n5:56:02PM\n\nOkay. That's fair. Thank you. Maybe I have a follow-up related to you talked about WWDC, where you actually introduced Vision Pro there. Clearly, a very big announcement there. How should we think about the revenue ramp related to the Vision Pro? Is there any catalyst that we should be thinking about that will drive an inflection of that product? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:56:25PM\n\nYeah. There's enormous excitement around the Vision Pro. We're excited internally. Everybody that's been through the demos are blown away, whether you're talking about press, analysts, or developers. We are now shipping units to the developer community for them to begin working on their apps. We're looking forward to shipping early next year. We could not be more excited with it. I'm using the product daily. We're not going to forecast revenues and so forth on the call today, but we're very excited about it.\nThank you, Sidney. Can we have the next question, please?\nCertainly. We will take our last question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\n5:57:21PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them as well. Number one, on iPhone, Tim, you mentioned about the record number of switchers in the quarter. I'm kind of curious how to think about, given the weak macro and consumer spending, how's the replacement cycle for iPhone? Is it similar, longer, shorter versus prior years? Can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity of iPhone during the June quarter? I have a follow-up.\nSwitchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter. We did set a record. We set a record in Greater China in particular, and it was at the heart of our results there. We continue to try to convince more and more people to switch because of the experience, the ecosystem, and that we can offer them. I think switching is a huge opportunity for us. In terms of the upgrade cycle and so forth, it's very difficult to estimate real-time what is going on with the upgrade cycle.\nI would say if you think about the iPhone results year-over-year, you have to think about the SE announcement in the year-ago quarter, the iPhone SE announcement in the year-ago quarter. That provides a bit of a headwind on the comp. As Luca said, as he talked about how we're viewing Q4, the September quarter, we see iPhone accelerating in Q4.\nGot it. Very helpful, Tim. My final question is, on your retail stores, you obviously have a very large retail footprint, and many of your stores seem to have been open for over a year now. How is the foot traffic there, and how do you think about sales or the retail trends in the June quarter and implications for the back half of this year on a seasonality basis? I'm sorry. Are you talking about our retail stores? Yes.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple\n\n5:59:45PM\n\nYes. Yeah. If you look at retail, it's a key part of our go-to-market approach. It will be so key and such a competitive advantage with Vision Pro. It will give us the opportunity to launch a new product and demo to many people in the stores, so it has many advantages in it. We continue to roll out more stores. As you know, we just opened two in India last quarter. There's still a lot of countries out there that don't have Apple stores that we would like to go into.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:02:01PM\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.\nApple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:03:19PM\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records, including in Brazil, Malaysia, and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost, to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways.\nAnd whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we track.\nDespite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products, whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus continue to delight users with their long-lasting battery and advanced camera, and our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users.\nWe now offer this vital service in 12 countries, and I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life-saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter, in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chips throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power-efficient performance continue to amaze our users.\nOur M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro-level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design, and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allow them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1-powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game-changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day.\nApple Watch Ultra is attracting adventurers, athletes, and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, services set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and payment services. And now, with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV+ continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season.\nMovies like Tetris are captivating viewers, with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV+ programming has been celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic ten-year partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway. With MLS season passed, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV+ subscribers can watch their favorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a standalone app that gives something special to classical music lovers.\nApple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, the premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony, just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later. Designed with users' privacy and financial health in mind, Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings Accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers.\nAnd we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the US, we launched Shop with a Specialist over video, a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creatives, and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months. So many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us.\nAnd that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our racial equity and justice initiative. And every day, we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 GW of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year.\nThis translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're also investing up to an additional $200 million in our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature-based carbon removal projects with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain. We're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple-designed batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025. And we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple.\nWe believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:14:29PM\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year, and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 5 percentage points on our results, in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland, among others. Product revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets, from South Asia and India to Latin America and the Middle East.\nDuring the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards services, partially offset by leverage. Product gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially.\nOperating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend but remain focused on long-term growth with continued investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52, unchanged versus last year, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets, with India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis.\nOur active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We're very pleased by the results of the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed base of Active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Also, the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations.\nThis performance was due to two key factors: a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip in the year-ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year, as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the US and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our watch installed base, which set a new all-time record thanks to very high customer loyalty and new-to rates.\nNearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion. And in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising, AppleCare, and video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings, such as digital advertising and mobile gaming, continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we're seeing across several key metrics. First, our growing installed base of over $2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction.\nSecond, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months, and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings, from new content on Apple TV+ to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction.\nIn Brazil, Boticário Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchisor, originally started with iPhone, 12 employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees, and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticário has chosen to move all software development in-house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software, and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business Week here in the US, we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nWe repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of $129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward.\nAs we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly 4 percentage points. For services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion.\nWe expect OINE to be around -$250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on 18 May 2023, to shareholders of record as of 15 May 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:25:26PM\n\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:25:33PM\n\nCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:25:42PM\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Tim, maybe if we start with you, if we go back to the December quarter and the production shutdowns around the time, I think the question a lot of us were asking was, how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? March quarter was quite strong, 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, how have you seen customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later in hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:26:25PM\n\nYes. Hi, Erik. It's hard to quantify this, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter. As we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter, the production levels for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be. So supply was not an issue during Q2.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\n5:26:51PM\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you for that, Cullen. And Tim, maybe to follow up, it's been three or four quarters now that you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others. And I imagine having just opened two new stores in the country, it's clearly an important market for you. So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market and others, how you think about monetization trends in the country, and specifically what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business? And that's it for me. Thanks so much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:27:24PM\n\nYeah, sure. Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record and grew very strong, double digits year-over-year. So it was quite a good quarter for us. Taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers. And three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online. And then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going.\nOverall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there. On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I had mentioned, with records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India, and Malaysia. And so it was a great quarter for emerging markets in general, despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned. And so we're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, etc., a great opportunity for us in those markets.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:29:42PM\n\nThanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:29:47PM\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:29:53PM\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the record installed base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double-digit growth over the last few years across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the installed base growth going forward? And then for the iPhone installed base specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of texture around how you think about the growth there, whether regionally or by first smartphones versus switchers? And then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:30:28PM\n\nYeah. If you look at the installed base of active devices now, overall, it's more than $2 billion. As you know, we announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, our Q2, rather, we set new records across each of the geographic segments and each of the major product categories. And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over a billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates and these sorts of things may change quarter to quarter depending upon macroeconomic.\nBut if you back up and look at the installed base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:31:46PM\n\nGreat. Excellent. And then it was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continue to grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple devices per iPhone user. And if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those, for lack of a better word, super users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem. Thanks.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:32:18PM\n\nWe try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together. And so whether that's the watch or the Mac, and so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices. And I think this is a testament to the customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering teams do on our products.\n\nMike Ng\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\n5:32:57PM\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:33:01PM\n\nThanks, Michael. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:33:05PM\n\nOur next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:33:10PM\n\nThank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about AI? Obviously, more than the topic of the day, it seems like the topic of the year. Just how you think about it through your products and services. I know you use it in different ways. But also, if you can just give us any thoughts you have on generative AI and, I don't know, where you see it going. Not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really curious as to your take. Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:33:40PM\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product roadmaps. I do think it's very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues that need to be sorted, as has been talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem. And we weaved it into products and features for many years, as you probably know. You can see that in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. These things are not only great features, they're saving people's lives out there. And so it's absolutely remarkable. And so we view AI as huge, and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:34:48PM\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about your shift of manufacturing and diversification of manufacturing footprint? I'm curious. Obviously, you have a very tight network in China. So how is it going to move to some of these other regions? Are you seeing any impact from a margin perspective or just any thoughts you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China, whether it's growth or it's actual production? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:35:26PM\n\nOur supply chain is truly global, and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the US. We're investing in a number of other countries as well. And so we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest everywhere. And we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and every day and week and so forth to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers. If you sort of step back and look at how we've performed over the last three years on the supply chain, despite this parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors, the supply chain has been incredibly resilient. And we feel good about what we are and what our plans are.\n\nShannon Cross\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\n5:36:27PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:36:29PM\n\nThanks, Shannon. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:36:34PM\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:36:40PM\n\nYes, thank you. Tim, you had called out on December quarter earnings that ProModels were significantly constrained. Do you see a catch-up on the ProModels specifically in the March quarter? And was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones. And I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:37:05PM\n\nSure. It's hard to quantify, Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter. And obviously, we had to set the channel at the right levels. And we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis. So we do think there were some, but it's difficult to quantify it.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:37:31PM\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tim. And Tim, as a follow-up, you launched so many services around Apple Pay. Most recently, you mentioned Buy Now Pay Later, High Yield Savings Account. Where do you see the expansion in the payments ecosystem over time? And do you look at the payments ecosystem as a standalone revenue opportunity, or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:37:57PM\n\nWhat we're trying to do with our payments work is that sort of like we've done on the watch, where we're focused on helping people live a healthier day, on our financial products, we're helping people have a better financial health. And so things like the Apple Card and the fact that it has no fees, like the savings account, which has, as you mentioned, its very attractive yield. So we're trying to help our users. And these things have to stand on their own, obviously. But we're very user-focused. And so we're listening to them at what things provide them pinch points and orchestrate our roadmaps around that. Buy Now Pay Later is another one that we've just gotten out of the chute. But on the savings account specifically, we are very pleased with the initial response on it. It's been incredible.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\n5:39:15PM\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:39:18PM\n\nThanks, Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:39:22PM\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:39:27PM\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just wanted to go back to maybe kind of dig into the restocking of inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective that appears to be a little bit softer in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers that exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So just want to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-à-vis how you were thinking about it maybe a month ago or even three months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of signals that you might want to share with us at this point? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:40:03PM\n\nI don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think you're probably referencing primarily US carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is primarily predominantly the United States. And a part of that is, I believe, is macroeconomic apart, is that there were more promotional activity in the year-ago quarter. And so I think that's what you're seeing there. Where our results were really stellar during this quarter was really in the emerging markets. And we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:41:12PM\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And then just quickly on services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumers' behavior other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming? Are you seeing users of all the disparate services change and what they're using and how they're using it and time spent with an Apple service now that we're technically, hopefully, fully past COVID with China almost fully reopened? I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behavior has changed over the last three to six months. Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:41:45PM\n\nMaybe it's Luca. As you said, of course, we got the issue around the macroeconomic environment, particularly in advertising and in mobile gaming. But outside of those areas, the behavior of customers continues to be pretty consistent. We are doing particularly well, obviously, in some of the services that we've launched more recently, like payments, where our growth rates are very strong, as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the new services that Tim mentioned. The adoption continues to increase. Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more content on their devices. And so they adopt our cloud services. And in general, the model in the App Store around paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions on the platform.\nAnd that's almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So obviously, the growth in subscriptions is very strong.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\n5:43:09PM\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:43:12PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:43:17PM\n\nOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:43:24PM\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services. And in the past, pre-pandemic, the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. The growth rates today, where you stand, even if I back out FX impact, is more about low double digits. So one of the questions that we get often from investors and want to get your thoughts on is, even as the installed base growth seems to have accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level? Or do you see more of a rollout on the monetization that you need to do to get back to those growth levels? And I have a follow-up, please.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:44:08PM\n\nSamik, the areas where we are seeing the impact on the macro environment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising. As you know, obviously, the macro environment is not helping on that front. And mobile gaming, where we've seen a bit of a slowdown, partly due to the macro environment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated usage during the COVID years. But outside of those areas, we continue to see very healthy growth rates.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:44:46PM\n\nOkay. And maybe if I can just follow up on this is more of a macro question. I don't know if Luca, you or Tim want to take this. But obviously, the macro is not sort of helpful at this point. But what you're sort of implying in terms of your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually guiding to a modest uptake except for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends? And overall, does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your products are doing independent of that?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:45:27PM\n\nSo part of it, Samik, is what Tim was talking about. We're having great momentum in emerging markets. And those are markets where our share is low, gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with the growth of the installed base because you can imagine that in places where our market share is low, we tend to add a lot of switchers, people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the installed base. And over the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n5:46:11PM\n\nThank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:46:14PM\n\nAll right. Thanks, Samik. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:46:18PM\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:46:24PM\n\nYep. I have two as well. I guess first off, on gross margins for the June quarter, they seem to be holding up fairly well, especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. Luca, I'm wondering if you can just touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequentially. It's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may. I also noticed that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points. It's typically 100. What does that entail? What does that mean?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:46:51PM\n\nYou're right. I mean, we are guiding to a fairly stable level of gross margins at a very high level. We're very happy with the gross margins that we're having this cycle. For the first time in several quarters, foreign exchange, we expect foreign exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, still a headwind at the revenue level. But at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. The seasonal loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. That should give us that level of margins. As you know, you were asking about the 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a range before as well.\nThis year, in particular, because of the 14th week during the December quarter, we're a bit late in the calendar year, right? And so we have a bit more visibility around margins for the June quarter.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:48:07PM\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Tim, if I just go back to the India discussion a bit, perhaps you could just contrast what you're seeing in India today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is that a reasonable ramp to think India would have, or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China?\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:48:25PM\n\nI think each country is different and has their own journey. And so I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the middle class. And I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone. And we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\n5:49:06PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:49:09PM\n\nThanks, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:49:13PM\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:49:17PM\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you've probably been a consumer-centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, and the hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise versus consumer? And does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.? And then I had a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:49:53PM\n\nInternally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer. And the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs. And there's more and more companies that are leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select, which is placed to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. And so but we're certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:50:41PM\n\nGot it, Tim. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, obviously, a lot of questions on the India retail opening. I'm just kind of curious. You also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you think the biggest opportunity is? Is it primarily a hardware business, like the iPhone, iPad, wearables, etc.? Or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:08PM\n\nI think there's an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously, the ARPUs are lower in India for whether you're talking about TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPUs are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\n5:51:44PM\n\nThanks a lot, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:45PM\n\nYep.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:51:48PM\n\nThanks, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:51:52PM\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\n5:51:58PM\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is that I want to go back to kind of the geographical dynamics. I'm curious, as we all think about the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple of quarters.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:52:31PM\n\nYeah. If you look at China, our revenue came in at negative three for the quarter year-over-year. But we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And we also accelerated as compared to the December quarter, which, as you know, had 14 weeks in it and was a negative seven on a reported basis. And so we were pleased with how we did and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening. And we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at the top-selling smartphones in urban China, based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five. And I think in all of the third-party data I've seen on the market itself in the smartphone space, we believe we gained share during Q2. So we feel good about it.\nIt also, China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new buyers. For example, on the Mac, about 6 out of 10 customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing on iPad. If you look over at the watch, it's more than 3 out of 4 customers are buying the watch for the first time. And so the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good. And our services business hit an all-time record in China during the quarter.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\n5:54:24PM\n\nYep. Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow-up, I want to go back to Amit's question on gross margin. You talked about FX, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious, when you look at your gross margin, obviously got mixed attributes, kind of potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious, on the current environment, how you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's guidance.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:54:47PM\n\nYeah. The environment on the component side is favorable. We've seen component prices decline during the March quarter. And we expect the same during the June quarter.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\n5:57:31PM\n\nThank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:57:31PM\n\nThank you, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:55:14PM\n\nOur next question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nSidney Ho\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\n5:55:20PM\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and perhaps the first four and a half weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere. But if my math is right, your fiscal third-quarter guidance implied product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal average on a sequential basis. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:55:45PM\n\nWe said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one that we just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind, we always have differences in the launch timing across our products. And also that, especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions. Sometimes it was COVID-related. Sometimes it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind you, in the June quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which leads to a more difficult compare. So I think it's important to keep those things in mind.\n\nSidney Ho\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\n5:56:46PM\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Maybe as a quick follow-up, you talked about Apple Pay Later. How has the feedback been so far? And how do you expect the adoption of that service over the next few quarters? Thank you.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:57:01PM\n\nThe feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the savings products have both been really good. And we think both of them help customers live a better or healthier financial life. And so we're very excited about the first days of both of them.\n\nSidney Ho\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\n5:57:25PM\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n5:57:31PM\n\nThank you, Sidney. Operator, can we have the last question, please?\n\nOperator\n\n5:57:44PM\n\nOur next question is from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:57:49PM\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a component maker. You actually use your own products. But we almost never hear in any context of you guys being a beneficiary, Apple being a beneficiary for either the CHIP Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being proposed. I was just curious if you're eligible for any of those, and then I've got a follow-up.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:58:16PM\n\nI don't see Apple participating in the CHIPS Act directly. But we would be a beneficiary indirectly because some of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it and therefore put in additional capacity. And so on that sort of indirect basis, we would have a benefit.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n5:58:51PM\n\nUnderstood. And thanks for the clarification. Luca, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, June should be down about two-something-odd percent. Is that a fair way? And then my question that I wanted to ask, maybe another one for Tim, was where do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? I mean, you're doing a great job. You just hit a record. But surely there must be areas where you think you can do better.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nCFO, Apple Inc\n\n5:59:26PM\n\nYeah. So to your question around the June performance, yes, on a year-over-year basis, so comparable to the March quarter on a year-over-year basis.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n5:59:36PM\n\nHarsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the number of active devices and the growth of active devices, I think our services are under-penetrated in a number of different ways. And so the way that I look at it is there's opportunity in many of them.\n\nHarsh Kumar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\n6:00:10PM\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, Tim.\n\nTim Cook\n\nCEO, Apple Inc\n\n6:00:11PM\n\nYep.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Apple Inc\n\n6:00:13PM\n\nAll right. Thank you, Harsh.

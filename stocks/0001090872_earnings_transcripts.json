Tejas, you may begin the conference.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Agilent Technologies\n\nThank you and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's Conference Call for the Q4 of fiscal year 2025. As many of you know, I recently joined Agilent after a fun 15-year stint on Wall Street, and I'd just like to say how excited I am to be joining the team at such a pivotal time in our journey. With me on the line are President and CEO, Padraig McDonnell, CFO, Adam Elinoff, and Rodney Gonsalves, Vice President, Controller, and Principal Accounting Officer, who served as interim CFO until Adam's arrival. Joining the Q&A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, Angelica Riemann, President of Agilent CrossLab Group, and Mike Zhang, President of the Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live.\nThe press release for our Q4 Financial Results, Investor Presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with a recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth is adjusted for the impact of currency exchange rates and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. Agilent assumes no obligation to update them.\nPlease look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nThanks, Tejas, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Before I talk about our results, I want to start by introducing Adam Elinoff, our new CFO, who officially joined Agilent last week. Adam joins us after a distinguished tenure at Amgen. He advanced through a series of finance, strategy, and transformation leadership roles over a total of 19 years, most recently serving as Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. I'm looking forward to leveraging Adam's expertise in strategic planning and M&A, and his commitment to cross-function collaboration will be invaluable to Agilent in the years ahead. Adam, would you like to say a few words?\n\nAdam Elinoff\n\nCFO, Agilent Technologies\n\nThanks, Padraig. I'm thrilled to join Agilent at such an exciting time. My interactions with the leadership team over the past few weeks, both within the finance function as we contemplated the guide, and with the broader team, have only reinforced my optimism for what lies ahead. I'm looking forward to working with the team to drive growth and innovation, advance operational excellence, and preserve Agilent's history of financial discipline.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nGreat to have you on board, Adam. I also want to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for Rodney stepping in as interim CFO over the past four months. His long, distinguished career at Agilent demonstrated he was more than capable of helping us bridge this important transition. Now, let me talk about the Q4 results. It was another strong quarter. The Agilent team executed exceptionally well, delivering the solutions our customers need in a market that is showing continuing signs of normalization. In the Q4, Agilent reported $1.86 billion in revenue, growing 7.2% on a core basis, our 6th consecutive quarter of core growth acceleration. This performance came in above the high end of our guidance. Our customer-first approach is paying dividends, with excellent top-line results that compare very favorably with our peers.\nMomentum remains broad-based across the portfolio, supported by strong LC and LC/MS demand and share gains, CDMO upside, solid double-digit contributions in key regions, and a replacement cycle that continues to accelerate. These trends reflect our structurally resilient portfolio and performance that tracks above the broader market. At the same time, our Ignite Operating System continues to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our organization. Ignite helped deliver more than 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement compared with last quarter, while funding incremental performance-driven variable pay. The bottom-line result was four-quarter Earnings Per Share of $1.59, above the midpoint of our guidance. Simply stated, in a dynamic environment that continues to evolve, the Agilent team delivered for our customers and our shareholders.\nAs we close the 2025 fiscal year, I want to highlight four key dimensions where we made exciting progress this year and that will drive our growth for the future. First, the innovative products and services that we develop with a customer lens to create differentiated value. Second, the extraordinary customer intimacy and trust our unified sales and service organization creates that unlocks high-quality lead generation and fund conversion. Third, the increased capabilities and level of talent throughout Agilent. Fourth, the Ignite Operating System that enables us to effectively combine these elements to drive long-term growth and maximize value for customers, shareholders, and employees. Let's start with innovative products and services. The success of our customer-focused innovation was on display throughout the year with products and services that differentiate us from the competition and drive our growth by solving real customer problems.\nThis includes our Next-generation Infinity III that is delivering as much as 30% improvement in productivity for our customers. Infinity III drove double-digit LC growth in the 2ndhalf of the year. That is underpinned by customers returning to buy large volumes of additional units because of their great experiences. Our Pro iQ LC/MS also has seen an amazing ramp. Its unique value proposition for Pharma and Biotech is driving strong customer interest, as well as sales that are well ahead of our already robust expectations. The summer launch of our Pro iQ drove overall single-quarter LC/MS growth of more than 50% in the 1st full quarter. Last month, we introduced our Altura Bio-inert column. Customers are rapidly adopting the Altura column, and the column's ramp is an order of magnitude greater than past column launches.\nThis is a clear indication of just how important increased sensitivity and resolution are in key applications that support Oligos and GLP-1s. These results also highlight new product launch excellence across the organization. When it comes to artificial intelligence, we are actively using AI to accelerate our innovation engine and drive operational excellence. For example, AI generates 80% of our engineering drawings based on product specifications and customer needs, thereby increasing design productivity and reducing custom design cycle times by 75% for our GC products. In our operations, our order fulfillment team is leveraging Agentic AI for testing, inspection, and control to eliminate redundant shifts, reduce downtime, and improve quality. Our 2nd key dimension, extraordinary customer intimacy, centers on a cornerstone of continued success, leveraging our unified sales and service model to maintain lasting customer relationships. Our commercial team members are uniquely positioned as trusted customer partners.\nAgilent's Commercial Model is a unified End-to-end organization that provides Pre-sales consultation, a modern, easy-to-use E-commerce platform, and a highly experienced, deep technical Post-sales service and support that ensures customer success. Our field service engineers build long-term relationships with our customers by partnering with them to solve their most critical problems. Those relationships provide highly valuable insights that fuel a vital, growing portion of our demand generation programs. Insights from our service team now account for 30% of all sales leads, and these leads come with an order conversion rate that is more than double that associated with the rest of the Sales Funnel. Because of our uniquely deep connection with our customers, it will come as no surprise that they consistently rate Agilent services as best in class. We don't take this privileged position for granted. That's why we continuously implement new ways to enhance customer intimacy.\nIn terms of AI and customer intimacy, we are working to deploy AI within our CRM to support our sales team with predictive insights, automating tasks, and proposing personalized content in service of our customers. We're also using virtual agents to complement On-site support in select markets to resolve customer issues more quickly. The third dimension is our increased capabilities and level of talent throughout Agilent. We've leveraged our deep bench of In-house talent and complemented it with external hires that bring fresh perspective and domain expertise. At an executive level, in addition to Adam, we brought on Meghan Henson to lead our HR team to help us build on our strong culture. Olga Spek, who joined us from Thermo Fisher Scientific as our Chief Technology Officer, brings deep scientific knowledge in analytical technologies and a proven ability to lead innovative R&D teams.\nMost recently, Joydeep Ganguly joined from Gilead Sciences to drive world-class manufacturing while leveraging our global scale to realize increased efficiencies. While these individuals are important and visible additions to our leadership team, all Agilent employees are focused on accelerating the pace of innovation, driving superior execution, and, most importantly, delighting our customers. Finally, we are bringing together these foundational strengths through our Ignite Operating System, our 4th key dimension. We launched Ignite at the start of the year to improve the pace and quality of our execution and to usher in a new mindset that leverages the power of the enterprise to maximize both growth and stakeholder value.\nSome examples of Ignite's early success include enhanced top-line growth through the creation and implementation of an enterprise pricing program that drove performance across the year, more than doubling our price growth compared to what FY 2024, faster decision-making, and improved efficiency by reducing layers of bureaucracy, meaningful procurement cost savings through globalization of vendor contracts that leveraged increased scale for additional negotiating power. We saw the power of Ignite in real time this year as it enabled the immediate creation of our tariff task force to drive a rapid and coordinated response to Global Tariff changes. The Cross-functional Task Force rapidly developed a unified strategy and executed a suite of interconnected projects that greatly accelerated our tariff mitigation efforts. As a result, we are highly confident that we will fully mitigate current tariffs in FY 2026. Also, Ignite has already delivered well over $150 million in annualized savings.\nThe Ignite Operating System is able to quickly assemble knowledge from across the organization, develop a thorough and actionable enterprise plan, and actively drive implementation and quantify outcomes. This is critical as Agilent continues to evolve. Finally, and this is important, Ignite has strengthened our organization readiness to identify, acquire, and integrate attractive assets. Our integration of BIOVECTRA is one example. It's been a highly productive year for Agilent. We've laid a robust foundation upon which we can drive long-term, differentiated growth and value. Now, let me share some additional details of our Q4 results, starting with our end markets. We continue to see signs of improvement in the Pharma market. The Agilent team was able to leverage those conditions and our customer-centric solutions into an excellent 12% growth during the quarter. We also saw a nice pickup in spending among our Biotech customers.\nThat spending grew in the low 20s during the quarter and low double digits ex-CDMO, which was led by our Large Accounts. Our customer-focused solutions for Oligotherapeutic developments, peptide-like GLP-1s, and Infinity III drove our performance in Pharma, contributing to low double-digit growth in LC and mid-teens growth in LC/MS platforms. That performance is above that of our peers and points to share gains across the replacement and greenfield opportunities. Our specialty CDMO business continues to be a differentiated growth driver. It represents nearly 20% of LDG revenue and grew more than 40% on a core basis during Q4. During the quarter, commercial programs drove 60% of our NASD revenue. The capacity increases we implemented at BIOVECTRA in the Q3 revenue to October.\nChemical and advanced materials grew 7% as we continue to see strong demand in the Americas and Europe. Chemicals customers continue to invest in capital equipment to meet the demand driven by reshoring of downstream customers in the Semiconductor market, increasing global competition for critical resources, and an enhanced focus on regional supply chain security. Diagnostics and Clinical continues to be a durable mid to high single-digit performer with 7% growth in the quarter. We're excited about the upside potential here as our new Dako Omnis family penetrates medium and low throughput labs. Environmental and forensics grew 9% as the approaching implementation of a revised EU drinking water directive drives investment in new capabilities. Also, Commercial Labs and Forensic Customers in the Americas are moving quickly to spend the capital budgets before year-end, even as US government spending in this end market remains muted.\nOur market-leading PFAS business grew high single digits in Q4 and almost 40% for the year, despite meaningfully tougher comps and the US EPA headwinds we mentioned last quarter. Environmental use cases remained a bulk of our PFAS revenue, though growth is increasingly coming from our end markets such as food and CAM. Our business in the food market finished a strong year with a growth of 7% in the quarter. Finally, academia and government, our smallest end market at 7% of annual revenue, declined 10% in the quarter. To no one's surprise, federal spending reductions had an increased impact on instrument spending in the US. In summary, our growth across major end markets continues to run ahead of our peers, supported by stronger LC/MS adoption, healthy contributions from specialty CDMO platforms, and solid traction in applied workflows.\nWe continue to see nice momentum in our instrument portfolio, with instrument book to bill exceeding one for the 7th consecutive quarter. We are in the early stages of a normalized replacement cycle and gaining share against the competition. Plus, the growth of our install base enables robust attach rates for consumables and service offerings, to lend meaningful durability to our top line via strong recurring revenue. As we look to FY 2026, our priorities remain clear: Advance our Ignite Operating System, Sharpen Commercial Execution, Capture Opportunities from Improving End Markets, Innovative New Products, and a Multi-pronged Replacement Cycle. In our end markets, we expect continuation of positive trends in Pharma. This will be enabled by improved visibility around pricing and a stabilizing tariff environment, as well as the very early stages of Pharma reshoring that we anticipate could start to materialize in orders towards the end of the year.\nWhile it's too soon to call an inflection, the accelerating pace of M&A and improving funding environment into October bodes well for our small and Mid-sized Biotech customers in FY 2026. We remain bullish on demand outlook for our specialty CDMO Pharma services. With strong market momentum in our key modalities like siRNA and GLP-1s, we expect to drive mid-teens growth in the coming year as we get ready for opening new capacity in 2027. We expect applied markets will continue to grow as customers adapt to shifting macro conditions, and structural drivers like the expansion of PFAS testing and Semiconductor reshoring support durable, long-term demand. In diagnostics and clinical, we see continued strength as testing demand grows, and our expanded Dako Omnis offerings enable new placement opportunities.\nIn our smallest end market, academia and governments, we are not expecting a meaningful recovery in FY 2026 as ongoing US federal spending headwinds seem to be unlikely to abate soon. Putting it all together, incorporating the stronger baseline comparison for FY 2026, we're starting the year with an expectation of 4% to 6 core growth. We believe this range is a prudent initial guide that takes into account secular growth drivers. This includes instrument replacement cycles, demand for our specialty CDMO services, modality-specific needs in GLP-1s and PFAS, and Pharma and Semiconductor reshoring. This allows for an evenness in ongoing recovery dynamics across our markets. We anticipate these growth drivers, reinforced by Ignite, to provide continued momentum. We also expect to deliver 75 basis points of Operating Margin expansion in FY 2026 at the midpoint.\nThis target allows us to make critical investments to drive innovation, expand our digital commercial capabilities, and prepare for opening of our new CDMO capacity in 2027, all while absorbing incremental material costs driven by tariffs and assumptions for a steady end market recovery. This margin expansion translates into 9% Operating Profit growth at the midpoint, demonstrating the strong operating leverage inherent to our model. For FY 2026 Earnings Per Share, we're guiding 5% to 7 that includes an EPS growth headwind of 3 percentage points from the one-time step-up in tax rate, reflecting the new Global Minimum Tax Regulations. Adjusted for this tax dynamic, underlying EPS growth would have been in the high single to low double-digit range. Our financial discipline remains unchanged.\nWe are deploying capital where it delivers the highest long-term value, balancing investments in innovation, M&A opportunities, as well as Strategic Capacity Expansion, while returning capital to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Rodney, who will provide additional details on the Q4 results and our guidance for next year.\n\nRodney Gonsalves\n\nVP, Controller, and Principal Accounting Officer, Agilent Technologies\n\nThanks, Padraig. Good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I'll provide additional detail on revenue in the quarter, as well as walk through the income statement and cover other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our new full-year and Q1 guidance. Q4 revenue was $1.86 billion, above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 7.2%, while reported growth was 9.4%. Currency had a favorable impact of 0.9%, while M&A contributed 1.3%. The BIOVECTRA acquisition is reflected in core growth starting in October.\nAt a Business Segment Level, LDG grew 11%, well ahead of guidance, bolstered by the strong performance in our LC and LC/MS instruments, and robust CDMO results. AMG grew 3% as expected, led by high single-digit growth in GC and GCMS, as we see increasing benefit from the instrument replacement cycle in those platforms as well. ACG grew 6% in line with our guidance, with high single-digit growth in the rest of the world, offset by mid-single-digit declines in China. On a geographical basis, both the Americas and Europe saw healthy 11% growth, with broad end market strength outside of academia and government. China declined 4%, and the rest of Asia ex-China grew 4%. Results in China were below our low single-digit growth expectations, though revenue contributions remained stable around $300 million per quarter.\nIndia grew in the high teens in Q4, with double-digit growth in Pharma and greater than 20% growth in each of our applied markets. This balanced strength across our geographies, which saw us deliver double-digit growth ex-China, remains a key differentiator of our performance profile. Gross margins in Q4 improved sequentially by 100 basis points and came in at 54.1%. On a year-over-year basis, they were down 100 basis points due to tariff headwinds. Operating Margins were 27.2%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage on volume, strong pricing, and tariff mitigation. We delivered this result despite absorbing an incremental 60 basis point sequential headwinds from performance-driven variable pay. Absent the variable pay dynamics that reflect better business conditions and our strong execution, Operating Margins would have expanded by 270 basis points over the prior quarter, well above our guide of 230 basis points of sequential expansion.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Operating Margins were down only slightly due to tariffs. Now, moving below the line, we had $10 million in other income, while our tax rate of 12% was as expected. Finally, we had 284 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q4 Earnings Per Share was $1.59. That was above the midpoint of our guidance, and grew 9% from a year ago. Now, let me turn to Cash Flow and the Balance Sheet. Operating Cash Flow was $545 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $85 million in shares, and paid $70 million in dividends during the quarter. More recently, we increased our industry-leading dividend by 3%. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8, pointing to our robust Balance Sheet that leaves ample room for capital deployment optionality.\nNow, let me share some additional details on the outlook for next year and the guidance for our Q1. We expect FY 2026 revenue to be in the range of $7.3 to 7.4 billion on a reported basis. This represents an increase of 4% to 6 on a core basis, as currency is expected to be a 1% tailwind during the year. To help with your models, I want to provide you with additional details on expectations for growth in our end markets during the year. Starting with Pharma, we anticipate high single-digit growth, improving market conditions, and the strength of our offerings in key high-demand applications create a favorable environment.\nIn the applied markets, we expect mid-single-digit growth in chemical and advanced materials, low single-digit growth in environmental and forensics, and flat growth from food, where we have a especially difficult year-on-year compare against a strong China Stimulus tailwind in FY 2025. In diagnostics and clinical, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth. In Academia and Government, we are guiding to a low single-digit decline, as we don't foresee meaningful recovery in the US. By business segment, we are guiding both the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group and the Agilent CrossLab Group to grow mid-single digit, and the Applied Markets Group to grow low single digit in FY 2026. Finally, by geography, we expect the Americas to lead the way with mid to high single-digit growth, while Europe and Asia ex-China grow mid-single digits, building on the momentum we saw in the back half of the year.\nIn China, we are incorporating a flat assumption for FY 2026, consistent with what we saw in China this year. Based on our latest expectations around Stimulus timing, we are taking a prudent approach and substantially moving Stimulus benefits from our FY 2026 revenue guidance. Moving down the P&L, we expect to deliver 75 basis points of Operating Margin expansion in FY 2026 at the midpoint. We anticipate a more gradual start given typical seasonality and the lack of tariff headwinds in the 1st half of FY 2025, with momentum building through the year. Reflecting the latest Global Tax Regulations, we see our tax rate increasing to 14.5%, a 2.5 increase compared with last year. We also expect $30 million in other income, and we are planning any diluted repurchases to maintain 284 million diluted shares outstanding for the year.\nPutting this all together, FY 2026 non-GAAP Earnings Per Share are expected to be between $5.86 and $6, representing earnings growth of 5% to 7. For your P&L modeling, let me share some additional expectations we have incorporated into our guidance for the year. Because of Ignite, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with an opportunity to grow well above 100 basis points. This guidance also incorporates achieving full mitigation of existing tariffs over the course of the year, using cost savings and pricing actions. As is typical, we expect to see substantial sequential improvement in Operating Margins over the course of the year. Finally, we anticipate Operating Cash Flow will be in the range of $1.6 to 1.7 billion, and expect to invest $500 million in capital expenditures. To help with phasing, we are expecting revenue seasonality similar to FY 2025.\nMeanwhile, earnings will be slightly more biased towards the 2nd half, given the tariff impact on the P&L in the 1st half. Now, moving to the Q1, we expect our reported revenue to be in the range of $1.79 to 1.82 billion. This represents an increase of 4% to 6 on a core basis, while currency is expected to be a 2.5% tailwind. Q1 EPS guidance is $1.35 to 1.38, with 285 million diluted shares outstanding. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nThanks, Rodney. As you've heard, we've built excellent momentum across FY 2025 in a dynamic environment. Our distinct growth drivers under Ignite Operating System are fuel for success. We are poised to benefit from a broadening end market recovery, win share, and deliver resilient, above-peer growth and margin performance over the long term. With our innovation engine accelerating, our focus on customers intensifying, and our Best-in-class commercial team executing, we are entering FY 2026 from a position of strength. Thank you all for your attention. I'll turn it back over to Tejas for Q&A. Tejas.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Agilent Technologies\n\nThanks, Padraig. Operator, can you please share the instructions for the Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Our first question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Padraig, I'm wondering if you can comment on BIOVECTRA. You guys had guided, I think, closer to $35 million. It came in around $22 million. Maybe just talk about dynamics there. You're taking CapEx up $100 million. Is that all CDMO?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. We're very pleased with BIOVECTRA. Came in strong for the year, driven by GLP-1 business. Q4 GOAT was a good, was an easy comparable, pleasing, nevertheless. We came in against what we thought for the year. We have key molecules planned for 2026. We're very, very happy about the book of business we have for BIOVECTRA. It was an outstanding integration from our side, which bodes well for the future, for future M&A as well. On the CapEx side, Adam, do you want to give some color?\n\nAdam Elinoff\n\nCFO, Agilent Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks. The incremental $100 million investment is really around incremental NASD capacity as well as incremental consumable expansion.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Follow up on margins, obviously a focal point, especially coming out of last quarter. Maybe just talk on the 75 basis points you're guiding to, the gives and takes there. If the top line ends up at the high end, could you do better?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. On margin, I think we have a prudent margin for 2026 set in, and we're going to go through some of the differences on the call. Adam, do you want to go through some of the ideas you have on margin?\n\nAdam Elinoff\n\nCFO, Agilent Technologies\n\nSure. If you think about the margin for 2026, at the midpoint, we're guiding 75 basis points improvement on a year-over-year basis. That's really driven by Ignite pricing optimization, some operational efficiencies that you see in the number, and that includes some of the tariff mitigations, then volume growth. The other piece, which I think is important, which I want to highlight, is this more than offsets inflationary impact. We're making incremental investments in growth and innovation, as well as adding strategic capacity. Let me just quickly talk about those incremental investments in growth, because I think it's something that Padraig's talked about with our capital allocation strategy. One, we're making digital advancements for our Commercial Teams and customers. The second, adding AI across the enterprise. We're really being focused there on a number of projects.\nWe're continuing to invest in our core R&D portfolio for our products. With August coming on, we're trying to make sure that we're investing in the most high-impact projects.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay, I'll leave it at that. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Donnelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGuys. Thank you for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe just on the general tone from BioPharma customers in recent months. Obviously, there's some big announcements. It sounds like things ticked up a little bit, both on Pharma and Biotech. Can you talk about maybe specifically on the instrument side, what you've been seeing? Again, it does sound like Biotech is loosening up a little bit for you guys. It sounds like Pharma is maybe a little more constructive. Maybe just talk about what you're seeing there. Even as we get into year-end here, is there already signs of what the budget flush could look like? What are you guys seeing there? Could that be a little more normal than past years? What are the conversations looking like there?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, thanks, Patrick. Pharma, largest market, grew 12% overall in the quarter. What we're seeing is the MFN tariff deals have really reduced uncertainty for our customers. Our Biotech grew in the low 20s, or I would say low double digits ex-CDMO. The US Biotech recovery is starting in well-funded large caps, releasing capital spend. I think what you're seeing in the small to mid-Biotech, you're seeing improved funding backdrop, and you're seeing that with recent M&A exits, although it really is too early to call an inflection point on that side. What's driving this is really, I would say, our strong momentum and our innovation around Infinity III is coming in extremely well, and Pro iQ LC/MS resonating extremely well. We had 50% growth for the single quad in Q4, and all of these things lead both well for the future.\nThat was backed up with our Altura Bio-inert column. I would say in terms of the budget flush, we have good visibility, and it's more of a typical calendar year-end budget flush. We're expecting that to be more normalized.\n\nPatrick Donnelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Maybe on the NASD business, it sounds like that's doing well. Double-digit growth, pretty safe for 2026, I guess, given what you're seeing. Can you just talk about the visibility there? Is that fully booked out through 2026? You talked about the expansion, the capacity expansion plan as the year goes. Can you talk about, I think it's Trains C and train D, when those come online, where those are leaning towards in terms of market need, market indications? Is there an impact to margins as those ramp? I know NASD is accretive on the Op margin side. As those trains open up, does that change anything? I know there's a few questions on NASD in there, but that color would be great. Thank you, guys.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. I'm going to start off and hand it over to Simon. We're really pleased with our CDMO results in FY 2025, and we're excited how the book of business is building for 2026 with recent wins. We're seeing movements towards commercial programs. Simon, do you want to give some more color on that?\n\nSimon May\n\nPresident of Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Again, I think we've had a very strong year here in FY 2025. We've been very pleased with the execution, very pleased with the way that the order book has been developing. We've seen a lot of further reasons to validate the siRNA modality. Just in the last couple of weeks, there was another FDA approval. We think that we are really well positioned here in coinciding the strength of the modality, the future outlook of the modality, and our competitive position in the market. As we look ahead to FY 2026, I'd say we've got a very robust order book as we enter the year for pretty much the full year. I think it's mainly a case of execution on existing capacity in FY 2026.\nAs the question indicated, we've got the capacity expansion starting to see the finish line coming to sight there towards the end of 2026. We're looking to go live in early to mid-part of 2027 with Trains C. As is always the case with the capacity expansion, there'll be dynamics there around amortization and growing into the skin. I think we've got the basis pretty well covered there in 2026, and we're well ahead in our thinking in that respect in 2027.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. My first question is on China. Can you talk about the downside variance on China in the quarter? What were the drivers of that, and performance by end market, perhaps?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Dan. Q4 in China was we were down 4%. That was below our low single-digit August guide. All markets were down low to mid singles except ANG, which was up 5%, benefiting from some academic Stimulus. Comp with peers, I think, were in line with key peers. Mix, I think, is an important factor, Dan. First of all, we saw growth in BioPharma and CAM. We saw declines in food and environmental. I would say Pharma, small molecule was stable. Overall, it's a very stable business. You're going to have quarters, some swings or variance between quarters. We're seeing sustainable $300 million per quarter as we go forward. We expect FY 2026 to be flat, like FY 2025 was flat.\nI will say, though, if you look at our business, given our long-standing customer relationships, our recent win rate, our scale, and our visibility into our direct channel, we're very confident in terms of our market share being stable in 2025. Of course, we're going to continue with that in 2026.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAppreciate that. A follow-up, Padraig. I think you mentioned that there was some Pharma reshoring assumption in your guidance for 2026. How important is that to your forecast? Any way to put some context or dimensions around that? Thank you.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. We're in a lot of conversations with some key Pharma companies around reshoring and talking about what it means for their R&D and tech investments. They're focusing on shovels in the ground and their lab equipment needs. We expect by the end of 2026 that we'll get some orders in that area. We're estimating the opportunity of about a $1 billion by 2030. We're limited in seeing the order benefit at the end of 2026. We see an overall $1 billion addressable market opportunity for Agilent by 2030. We expect about 1/3 of that. Overall, I think there's upside in the forecast around reshoring.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to start on GLP-1s. How big is this business? I'm thinking it's probably around $100 million coming out of last year. I guess if that's right, how much of it is LC versus services? What's your positioning with generics coming online in different geographies, like in India, China, and Canada, just to name a few? How should we think about the growth outlook for 2026?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Doug. Agilent's GLP-1 benefit really comes through two forms. Our CDMO business, largely around BIOVECTRA, where we're working on Synthetic Peptide Manufacturing, and our analytical tools like our LC/MS and Altura columns supporting QA/QC solutions. We're actively involved with many of the GLP-1 manufacturers. Of course, on the Analytical Tools side, Infinity III is a really key component. If you look at Q4, revenue was about $40 million for GLP-1. That split about 60% for BIOVECTRA and 40% for the Analytical Lab. I would say we saw about a 20% growth rate in the Analytical Lab in Q4. BIOVECTRA added about $25 million. If you look overall in 2025, I think the GLP-1 revenue is about $130 million, split evenly between both BIOVECTRA and the Analytical Lab.\nIf you think about the Analytical Lab, we grew 40% in the Analytical Lab and the GLP-1. Altura columns really helping towards the end, and of course, the Infinity III. Overall, it's a really important business for us, and we're seeing a long runway into 2026 on both sides of the business. India is a particularly interesting part of where you see the GLP-1, where you see the Patent lift coming. We've been doing a lot of investment in India around our experience center for customers, workflow help for our customers. We expect in India, we're going to take a lot of share as it goes into 2026.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. Super helpful, Padraig. One more on a completely unrelated topic, the academia and government end market. I think you guys were down 10% constant currency in the quarter, if I updated the model right. I think this is a little bit surprising given seasonality, and the fact that there was a little more certainty about the funding environment. Maybe the offset was the government shutdown. I'm just curious if you could tell us a little bit about what you saw over the course of the quarter and heading into calendar year-end. Thanks again, and happy Thanksgiving, everyone.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Doug. Academic and government declined about 10% for Q4. That was a slightly bigger decline than we put out in guidance. I would say ex-US, very stable sequentially. However, I think we faced tougher year-over-year comps with Americas down mid-teens. I would say the rest of the world was down mid-single digits. US federal spending reductions was really the material impact. Instruments were down mid-20s for the Americas, while I would say chemistries and services were resilient, low single digits for the Americas. We're seeing reasonable lab usage. I would say on the US government shutdown that you described there, Doug, we saw no material impact from that. We're expecting continued softness in FY 2026 in Americas as US federal spending reductions continue as we go forward. I will say it's our smallest market.\nIt's about 1% of our overall business in the US and the NIH spending.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Couillard\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon. Padraig, I mean, if we look at the ACG business, you said all reasons that ex-China grew high single digits in the Q4. I think you only talked about mid-single digit growth in 2026. Do you expect to see a halo benefit as the instrument cycle continues to escalate next year, or are you just being conservative here? Unpack how you're thinking about ACG in 2026?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'm going to kick it off, and I'm going to hand it over to Angelica. We saw healthy high single-digit growth ex-China in ACG. We continue growth on our install base and ramping attachment rates, and we're confident that ACG is well positioned to really sustain the long-term recurring revenue ramp. It was really a solid quarter, and we saw 6% growth in Q4 at the high end of our guidance. That was 8% ex-China. Angelica, you want to give some more color?\n\nAngelica Riemann\n\nPresident of Agilent CrossLab Group, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, sure. Hi, Brandon. We're very excited by the continued growth that we're seeing in ACG, largely driven by the size of our install base, but also the customer's utilization of assets in their laboratory. We've seen some great adoption of our recent chemistries launch, the Altura Bio-inert column. We also launched recently a RemotePlus services offering, which allows us to support customers and build stronger relationships with customers that may have capabilities In-house, but want to leverage the capabilities and the know-how of the Agilent field service engineers to be able to get them back up and running when they have unplanned or unexpected downtime. We're still seeing a great amount of interest in improving lab productivity.\nWe're seeing continued adoption of our OpenLab Chromatography Data System and our enterprise content management capabilities as customers are looking to better manage the data coming out of their instruments. We're seeing some good growth in our automation. When you look across the portfolio, we have a lot of things to take as momentum going into FY 2026. Certainly, as we see tech refresh and we see replacements of instruments in the laboratory, those provide long-term growth as those instruments continue to be used and will be connecting to those with our recurring revenue streams accordingly.\n\nBrandon Couillard\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's great. Thanks. I'm not sure if this is better for Rodney or Adam. Just a clarification, what was net pricing in the Q4? I think you talked about 100 basis points in fiscal 2026, but that there could be upside to that maybe from some of the AI tools. Can you just clarify what you're penciling in for pricing next year? Thanks.\n\nRodney Gonsalves\n\nVP, Controller, and Principal Accounting Officer, Agilent Technologies\n\nNorth of 100 basis points.\n\nBrandon Couillard\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nIn the Q4, Rodney?\n\nRodney Gonsalves\n\nVP, Controller, and Principal Accounting Officer, Agilent Technologies\n\nIn the Q4, we were closer to 150 basis points.\n\nBrandon Couillard\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, Padraig. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice spring here. My first one on order commentary here in the quarter, how did orders in the backlog grow? I'm curious. I know last quarter you were speaking about Stimulus, China-related Stimulus, maybe some Pharmacopoeia updates out there. I'm curious if any of that is showing up in orders.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. I can talk at our Book-to-bill was greater than one. Orders continued to, I would say, continue to be positive as we go through the quarter. It's been very stable through the quarter in terms of our order rate, and, of course, our Win-loss ratio, etc. I will talk a little bit about Stimulus. The first one, the SAMR tender, it shifted, I would say, from Q1 to later in the year in 2026. We were expecting roughly about $10 million GACC orders in Q1 2026, which was smaller than expected. That is excluded from our 2026 guide. Anything on the, I think, in the abundance of caution, we're excluding it from the 2026 guide. If anything comes in on that side, it will be upside.\nWe have a very strong track record on a win rate with Stimulus in China, winning 50% of the 1st round tenders. We're seeing how the year plans out and staying very close to our customers on that.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's helpful. Maybe my follow-up on margins. Gross margins is a little light in Q4. What do you assume for gross margins in fiscal 2026? Should we see Gross Margin Expansion? Could you just quantify what is tariff versus FX dynamics on gross margins?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nRodney, you want to take this one?\n\nRodney Gonsalves\n\nVP, Controller, and Principal Accounting Officer, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, I'll take this one. We're not guiding gross margins, but we should see gross margin expansion. Again, from a tariff standpoint, we do think we'll be fully mitigated on tariffs in the second half. That'll be a mix of both pricing and cost reduction activities. That in itself will be helping help the margin picture, along with pricing and leverage. The other thing that we think that was an impact for this year has been BIOVECTRA. Now that that's been annualized, it won't necessarily be an impact, a drag to the gross margin line.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. Just wanted to unpack some of the competitive dynamics going on in the LC business. The first one is in LDG, there were a few stats thrown around. I think I heard double-digit growth in the second half for LC, LC/MS instruments. What was the Q4 number? Was it also double-digit? I heard the Pharma data point. Can you just talk about how that business is doing in some of the other end markets?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. In the Q4, we saw low double-digit growth in LC and actually mid-teens growth in LC/MS, so a very strong performance. As we talked about the replacement cycle before, we're in the early innings of a replacement cycle, and that's accelerating with a lot of adoption of the Infinity III, some initial purchases a number of quarters ago, and customers coming back for more on that one. I would say when you look at the independent market share data, we're gaining share in both those areas. That's very good to see as we go forward on it. I would say overall, it's the new innovation, execution by the team, and also an improving Pharma sentiment, particularly with having reducing certainty around the MFN and tariffs.\nThe other thing that we're really seeing in Pharma across the globe is reshoring is not just happening in the US, supply chains are being consolidated in different geographies. People are looking for capacity expansion. We're the benefactor of that in QA/QC downstream testing. That will continue, I think, throughout the year. Of course, as reshoring comes online in 2027. I don't know if you want to add any more color on that, Simon.\n\nSimon May\n\nPresident of Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, I think you covered Pharma really well. Padraig, a few other key end markets. Mid-single digit growth in food. We saw declines in academia and government consistent with what we've been seeing elsewhere. Environmental and forensics was growth in the 20s. Again, in terms of the growth drivers, all the key things that we talked about already, the continuing traction we see with Infinity III is just phenomenal. Likewise, the Pro iQ market acceptance is really terrific. In terms of replacement cycle, we still see that we're early to mid-inning here. I think we've knocked off the lowest hanging fruit. As we continue to iterate the productivity features of our LabAssist software, we see that the Infinity III value proposition will continue to be very strong. We think there's still plenty more legs left in that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe Padraig, just when you think about the guide for 2026 at a high level, the 4% to 6, you've given a lot of color on segments and customers. If you zoom out, I think you finish this year around 5%. The guide next year incorporates that at the midpoint again, and you've discussed a lot of momentum building. Do you feel like the guide fairly balances the puts and takes around the globe, or do you think there's some conservatism more so baked in? Just can you give a sense on the overall four to six guide?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, I think, first of all, we're set up for success really by innovative products coming online. The ones that have come online are unified sales and service connection with the customers, the winning team, and Ignite wrapping together. As you said, we have good momentum coming out of the year. Key markets are improving. The top line 4% to 6% is prudent, but I think is appropriate given macro uncertainty. Of course, we're coming into some tougher compares. I would say if you look at the high end of our guide, if you see the expecting by our Pharma recovery to continue and broaden, that's going to be positive. As I said before, the China Stimulus is not in the guide. That would be positive as well. We're making investments in the business, right?\nWe've invested a lot in the business, and we're going to continue to do that, particularly in innovation as digital as Adam talked about. We want to see small to mid-size cap Biotechs continue to improve. We're seeing the early shoots on that one. Of course, ANG is academia and government, an area that we're watching. We want to see that stabilize relative to our current expectations of a low single-digit decline. Overall, when you put it together, strong momentum come out of 2025, and in 2026, we're watching the different portions of it.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks for that. Maybe just one on the GC upgrade cycle. Just your 10% growth in the quarter overall, which was solid. I think you said mid-single digit for 2026, and you gave some color. Just any more color on the upgrade cycle? How's it progressing versus expectations? Is it ratable in 2026? Just what's assumed on that front? Thank you.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. No, thanks. I'm going to start off and hand over to Mike here in the room. First of all, I think we had high single digit growth in GC, which was really great. We talked in the last quarter about the start of a GC replacement cycle, which is generally a longer replacement cycle than LC. Mike, do you want to give some color on the replacement cycle?\n\nMike Zhang\n\nPresident of Applied Markets Group, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Padraig, first of all, thank you, Den, for your question. The replacement cycle for the GC and the GCMS is very important for us. Here's what we've seen. First of all, I think the cycle has been normalized. It was under pressure for the last few years because of the global challenges and certainty. We've seen the pace is coming back and normalized. That's number one. Number two, I just want to let you know we are the market leader. We have built a very large install base, and as you can imagine, it's actually aging. We have a lot of pent-up demand, which will create a sustainable tailwind for us in the coming years. Last thing I want to highlight, now under Ignite transformation, we accelerate our innovation.\nWe're very excited about the new product coming out and that it will further sustain this reaping cycle. In short, I think very big opportunities and the cycle has been normalized, and we have tremendous innovation coming our way to sustain it.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Michael Riskin with BofA. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Riskin\n\nAnalyst, BofA\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first one on tax rate. You talked about the higher tax rate for 2026, talked about Global Tax. Just curious, we've been talking about tax rate potentially drifting higher for a while. It seems like it's a pretty big jump this year. Is this something new that's developed recently, or is it just the same Global Tax because we've been talking about for a while? Just any potential to offset that as you go through the year? Just how do we think about that going forward?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I'm going to hand this one over to Adam for some commentary.\n\nAdam Elinoff\n\nCFO, Agilent Technologies\n\nSure. Thanks. Our tax rate's increasing 250 basis points. It's really driven by a combination of things that take time to come together, and now they have. One of them is Pillar two, the other is OB three, and then there's other jurisdictional changes. As we've put them together in our tax provision, we've now solidified on this 250 basis point increase. I would, as you think about it going forward, say we have no information that this would change meaningfully going forward. The thing I want to highlight and point out is that we're more than offsetting this incremental tax burden, and that's really through operating performance above the line. We'll continue to seek ways to further mitigate the P&L impact via Ignite in our Global Network Strategy.\nIf you think about the business, being able to offset such an impact below the line, above the line is really something that gives me a lot of confidence in this organization and shows the agility of the organization to navigate uncertainty.\n\nMichael Riskin\n\nAnalyst, BofA\n\nThanks. For the follow-up, I want to touch on M&A and capital deployment. Patrick, you've talked about the health of the Balance Sheet and maybe looking to do a couple more deals, bolsters on the portfolio. Could you just talk about what the deal funnel looks like now, appetite for deploying cash next year, what deals you're looking at in terms of size, and any specific areas you're focused on? Thanks.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. I'm going to start off and then hand over to Adam here. Our capital allocation priors are not changing. If you think about M&A, we have capacity to do M&A, but we're going to remain very disciplined, linked with our strategy. We don't talk really about size. We talk about fit and shareholder return on M&A, about how it's going to drive us forward. What I will say about our M&A target list, it's a shorter, very high-quality list that we continue to develop. Of course, we'll continue to keep everybody updated as we go through the year. We're looking for growth opportunities where we have a right to win. The BIOVECTRA integration, having been such a great integration this year, bodes extremely well for the future. Adam, do you want to give some broader capital allocation color?\n\nAdam Elinoff\n\nCFO, Agilent Technologies\n\nSure. Thank you. Our capital allocation priorities aren't changing, as Padraig said. I think that's very important. We're going to continue to invest in innovation, as you hear in our guide. We're going to use our Balance Sheet to invest in M&A, and then make Strategic Capacity Expansion. The other piece I'd highlight is we're going to continue to return excess capital to shareholders, as you see in our guide as well. One note I would highlight, in addition to what Padraig said about remaining disciplined, it's about the right opportunity. It's about making sure we understand the value drivers and how we can maximize on those. It comes down to making sure that we pay the right price so that we're disciplined about price, and then focusing on integration upfront.\nIn my experience, I've lived through integrations, and the best are those that you plan for upfront, and it's not an afterthought. I can assure you it won't be here. The Ignite Operating System, as I've dug into it, gives me a lot of confidence. As Padraig said, the recent experience with BIOVECTRA gives me more confidence. I think we're ready to go, and you should expect to see consistency with what we've said on our capital allocation priorities.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Agilent Technologies\n\nRegina, to help us get to as many Analysts as possible, could we please limit it to one question per Analyst for the remainder of the call?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHappening, guys. Thanks for the questions. Padraig, you mentioned upside potential for the Omnis franchise. Is that more of a placement comment or a pull-through comment? Where do you think the opportunity is strongest there? Thanks.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nOn the Omnis, yeah. I'm going to hand it over to Simon for some color on the Omnis franchise.\n\nSimon May\n\nPresident of Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah, it's a bit of both. We've recently launched the Omnis family, and we've been very happy with the uptake from those systems. If we look year-over-year across the entire Omnis instruments franchise, we've seen double-digit growth in instrument placements. We're also focused on menu expansion, which is a key product development initiative here over the next 12 to 24 months. I think we're going to see momentum from both of those. We're seeing momentum already on the instrument placements, so I think it bodes well for the future. We talked a few times about this franchise now, how we see really durable mid-high single-digit growth through a combination of these portfolio investments, but also the very strong macros that underpin this business with aging populations, cancer incidents, and so on, not to mention the emerging therapeutics that are supporting diagnosis and therapy guidance.\nWe put all that together, and we're bullish about the future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Casey Woodring with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nCasey Woodring\n\nVP of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nAwesome. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. Appreciate it. I guess within Pharma in the quarter, excluding the CDMO, could you break down the large molecule versus small molecule growth? Last quarter, you talked about you did BioPharma spend, XNASD. Sounds like that got a lot better this quarter, specifically in Biotech. Maybe what's factored into the guide for large molecule versus small molecule in 2026, excluding the CDMO? Thanks.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. I think we saw growth on both sides. I would say we're equally placed. Both large molecule was about 10% growth, small molecule in around the same growth rate. It's roughly a 50% split for Agilent. We saw that in the quarter, and we expect that to continue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nCatherine Schulte\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Director, Baird\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll ask the annual lunar new year timing question. I think that was a 2% headwind in the Q1 last year, but it's back to falling in February this year. If we think about the 4% to 6 guide for Q1, does that mean more like 2% to 4 Ex-lunar New Year? If so, what's driving that sequential slowdown there? Thanks.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. I think if you look at our Q1 guide, we're assuming low single digits growth for China on a reduced Stimulus volume. That's about a -700 basis point year-over-year impact, and that's offset by the favorable lunar year-to-year timing, which is about 800 basis points. Q2 will be, I would say, meaningfully impacted by lunar new year timing and, I would say, a tougher comp. Overall, I think it balances out over those quarters.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nLuke Sergott\n\nDirector of Healthcare Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow up on Donnelly's question earlier in the call about, you guys were talking about keeping the Flywheel going and investing back in R&D as the top line continues to accelerate or be strong. After you're pretty much done, you guys had a pretty big launch here across many different platforms. Give us an update. Where are you looking to deploy that R&D? Where are the new high-growth areas that you guys would like to be bigger in? Is this just updating parts of the portfolio that have been underinvested?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nPresident and CEO, Agilent Technologies\n\nYeah. What I would say is that we have a very key innovation focus with our new CTO, August. What we're looking at is really looking at our portfolio of innovation across the company. We simplified the company structure where we went from about 20 product lines to nine. The ability to get the right innovation dollars into the right place is much clearer and faster now. What you're going to see is that you're going to see that in a number of platform launches over the next year, next coming years, but also areas where we need to accelerate in certain areas like Oligos, GLP-1s, and workflows around that side. I would say software is a key area for us. It's an area where we have a lot of focus across the company and the ACG group.\nWe're going to be asymmetrically investing in our software products and also making sure we have the right software for particular workflows. Overall, I would say it's a refocusing, but a very agile refocusing of our R&D dollars.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Agilent Technologies\n\nTejas, I'll turn the call. Go ahead, Regina.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll turn the call back to you, Tejas.\n\nTejas Savant\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Agilent Technologies\n\nThank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Happy holidays and happy Thanksgiving.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

Core revenue growth is adjusted for the impact of currency exchange rates and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates.\nAs a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to the reorganization of our 3 business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements.\nDuring this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Agilent delivered outstanding results of $1.74 billion in revenue in the third quarter, exceeding our guidance, while continuing to transform our enterprise operating model in a highly dynamic environment. We also delivered $1.37 earnings per share in the quarter. Thank you to the Agilent team, who has remained laser-focused on our customers and committed to our mission of advancing the quality of life.\nOur fiscal 2025 third quarter marks our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential core revenue acceleration a testament to how we've evolved our enterprise strategy to be market first and then realign our businesses to our markets. For this fiscal year, we've gone from 1.2% in Q1 to 5.3% in Q2 and now 6.1% in Q3. Just as important, our 2-year growth stack also is improving, showing that this is a durable momentum, not just a short-term balance.\nThe 2-year stack is a summation of our growth over 2 consecutive years, providing a clear view of sustained performance by smoothing out short-term quarterly fluctuations. Given this strength, we are raising our fiscal 2025 full year revenue guidance to the range of $6.91 billion to $6.93 billion, representing a core growth of 4.5% at the midpoint. This is a $150 million increase from our prior range at the midpoint and 1.5 percentage points of additional core growth, a clear step-up in our growth outlook heading into Q4. This upgrade reflects our confidence in delivering another step-up in revenue into Q4, even as we absorb the impact of tariffs this year.\nOur momentum is broad-based and led by our 2 largest end markets, Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials. In Q3, both grew 9% and 10%, respectively. In pharma, small molecule grew double digits, fueled by demand in downstream QA/QC and strong adoption of our Infinity III LC platform. GLP-1s also continue to drive demand, both for our leading analytical lab solutions and the unique capabilities we bring with BIOVECTRA.\nIn Chemicals & Advanced Materials, demand rebounded across all major geographies. This was supported by new investments in the semiconductor and chemical sector with robust uptake in our GC and GC/MS platforms. We also saw healthy contributions from our food and diagnostics and clinical end markets. And the academia and government end market returned to modest growth despite continued funding pressures in the U.S. Environmental and forensics was the only market to decline as changes in the U.S. EPA led to some cautiousness on new capital spending.\nDespite this temporary headwind, our market-leading PFAS business grew low double digits globally during the quarter. against the tough compare of nearly 50% growth last year. Demand outside the Americas continued to be excellent with broad-based growth in the low 30s. PFAS remains an excellent opportunity with strong long-term demand drivers intact globally. Powering the strength of our execution is our Ignite enterprise operating model.\nThis year, our value-driven approach to pricing delivered results that were twice the impact of last year. At the same time, we streamlined the enterprise by reducing management layers by more than 15%. That didn't just remove cost. It gives us speed. We're making decisions faster and empowering our teams to be agile. We're also taking a consistent enterprise-wide approach to manufacturing and procurement. These efforts already are delivering double-digit savings in key cost categories, and we see even greater opportunities ahead as we scale these practices globally.\nOur Ignite tariff task force has shown the power of the model in action. In a highly dynamic environment, we reorganized supply chains, shift the production across our global footprint and implemented targeted pricing actions. Giving us confidence we can fully mitigate the impact of tariffs in 2026 at current rates. Ignite continues to be a differentiating growth driver for Agilent. It is proving that by embedding new tools, enhanced capabilities and smarter ways of operating across the company, we unlock the full scale of our enterprise. That means stronger performance today and resilience and growth for tomorrow.\nInnovation also continues to be a major driver. Our Infinity III LC platform delivered mid-teens growth, with early adopters coming back for a larger follow-on purchase based on a superior performance and productivity gains. And the Pro IQ LC/MS system is tracking well ahead of our launch forecast winning key accounts at major pharma customers. The new systems performance benchmarks open new application possibilities across pharma and biopharma and are resonating strongly with customers as evidenced by strong formal growth during the quarter. Also, the newly launched Paco Andes family brings our go standard fully automated pathology platform through a broader range of lab sizes, capturing a new market segments and strengthening our diagnostics portfolio.\nTogether, these platforms are not just driving near-term revenue they are continuing to build the foundation for sustained growth into FY '26 and beyond. This growth is supported by a strong funnel and accelerating customer adoption across our portfolio, demonstrated by an instrument book-to-bill above 1 for the last 6 quarters.\nImportantly, we expect Q4 to be our largest revenue quarter of the year, with core growth of 5.4% and revenue of nearly $100 million higher than Q3 at the midpoint of our guidance. Our sequential momentum and 2-year growth back remains solid. And combined performance of the second half provides a sound foundation as we look into FY '26. The growth we expect in Q4 is underpinned by healthy demand for key platforms, strong form of conversion and broad-based strength across our end markets. The latest industry data is evidence of our continued superior commercial execution with market share gains across all major geographies.\nThe combination of strong top line performance as stable operating margin means we have successfully delivered to our bottom line commitments throughout the year. However, we did have higher expectations for margin improvement in the quarter. The increasing revenue growth also comes with additional tariff expenses and higher variable pay. We've invested in our commercial capabilities to support our growth now and into the future.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver significant sequential margin improvement as increasing revenue combined with additional Ignite benefits will result in accelerated profit leverage. Rodney will provide some additional details in his remarks.\nNow let me tell you more about why our Q3 was so strong. Starting in our largest end market, Pharma, we grew 9% during the quarter and continued to see steady improvements we referenced for 7 quarters now. This quarter, we saw positive momentum in formal conversion as lab managers are increasingly able to access and spend our available capital budgets. There is reduced dependence on executive level approvals that have slowed or stopped spending in the recent past. Our long-time lab-wide enterprise service relationships with large pharma enable us to capitalize on these improving conditions with deeper visibility into customer needs. This ensures we are in the right place at the right time with the right solution when lab managers are looking to replace aging instruments and expand capacity.\nIn our second largest end market, Chemical & Advanced Materials, we delivered 10% growth with broad strength globally. Growth was balanced between 2 submarkets. We saw increased capital investment from chemical customers and robust demand in advanced materials space and investments in new semiconductor fab facilities globally continue to progress. Our market leadership in key product platforms for these markets position us well to capture the significant instrument replacement opportunity in a market that has seen several years of underinvestment. All our business segments delivered revenue growth that exceeded guidance for the quarter.\nThe Life Science & Diagnostics market grew 7% core. Growth was led by excellent low double-digit performance for LC and LC/MS instruments leveraging our recent Infinity III launch and focused LC/MS solutions for key applications across both pharma and the applied markets. LPG also saw another strong quarter from our CDMO business, NASD and BIOVECTRA grew in the high 20s as we see continued growing demand for siRNA modalities in clinical and commercial programs. BIOVECTRA also delivered on expectations while executing a planned facility shutdown to work with a key customer to transition to a higher throughput process.\nIn the Applied Markets group, growth of 5% was also ahead of expectations. Breaking down the performance, our market-leading platforms, GC GC/MS and spectroscopy delivered strong growth in Q3 with encouraging momentum in the Chemicals & Advanced Materials, Food and Pharma markets. Geographically, all regions delivered growth led by Asia, ex China and EMEA. The geographic growth in AMG was driven by investment from supply chain reshoring, greenfield opportunities, capacity expansion and replacement from our large installed base.\nAlso, our recent launch new products, including the 8850 GC continue to ramp up ahead of expectations as customers are attracted by their exceptional performance, superior low productivity gains and leading sustainability benefits.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group delivered 5% growth in Q3, better than we had guided. The CrossLab team drove mid-single-digit consumables and supported by our focus on e-commerce and digital. This was a strong result despite the $50 million tariff-driven pull forward of sales into Q2 that we mentioned during our last call.\nThe services business grew mid-single digits, led by strength in the applied markets in Europe. Agilent Service continues to delight our customers, achieving greater than 90% customer satisfaction and meeting our vision of our customers to feel confident valued and inspired. Lab activity remains strong, giving us confidence in the fundamental strength of this business, plus the increasing pace of instrument sales for replacement of aging fleets and labs where capital budgets have been reduced or withheld expansion for new capacity and growing demand for automation bodes well for CrossLab business into the future. It provides a cycle to generate customer lifetime value through connections of high-quality consumables software services and automation to maximize instrument utilization and overall lab productivity.\nTurning now to our geographic results. We saw a broad-based growth with all regions growing at least mid-single digits during the quarter. Our business in Asia ex China continues to capitalize on opportunities from reshoring of supply chains growing 10%. And we saw increasing safety regulations across the region to drive an excellent mid-20s percent growth for our food markets.\nWithin the region, India continued to lead the way with broad strength across our end markets, resulting in 20% overall growth. We are seeing great success with the Infinity III as existing and new customers in pharma QA/QC environments look to benefit from its productivity improvements. As the country invests to build domestic semiconductor and EV manufacturing capabilities, we are seeing increased demand for our solutions in these markets.\nIndia is a strategic growth market for Agilent. As part of our increasing investments there, I visited India in July to open Agilent's Biopharma Experience Center in Hyderabad. This center will bring together advanced lab technologies, expert training and regulatory-ready workflows to help researchers scientists and companies develop high-quality life-saving medicines faster and more efficiently.\nIn Europe, growth of 7% was also broad-based, with double-digit growth in Pharma and Food, and high single-digit results in Chemicals & Advanced Materials and academia and government. In China, results continue to be stable as expected, growing 4% during Q3. We saw some government funding flow to some of our academia and government customers during the quarter. Based on our interactions with customers and local efficiency, we continue to expect a more meaningful stimulus impact towards the end of this calendar year, primarily in our applied markets.\nIn the U.S., the challenging conditions for biopharma spending and an academia and government space persisted. Outside of those areas, we saw a nice low double-digit growth in small molecule pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials. Improved capital spending has driven instrument placements leading to a 5% growth in the Americas in the quarter.\nWe continue to meet the challenge presented by the dynamic environment for global trade. Tariff expenses were higher than our prior expectations as we saw a meaningful increase in shipment volumes and increased inventory to support Q4 growth. We continue to leverage our unique Ignite enterprise operating model to optimize our use of global production networks, manage our diversified supply chain to optimize materials costs and where required, make pricing adjustments to offset added costs. Leveraging Ignite, we still expect that we will fully mitigate the impact of tariffs, either through avoidance or other offsetting opportunities in FY '26.\nAnd before I hand it over, I want to take a moment to introduce Rodney. Some of you might know him from a period where he led Agilent's Investor Relations team. For those who do not, Rodney has been an integral part of the finance leadership team at Agilent for many years. He has been a principal accounting officer for the last 10 years and are also leading our FP&A team. I am delighted at how he's been able to seamlessly step in and lead our finance organization while we conduct a thorough search for our next CFO. Rodney will share further details about our Q3 results and guidance for Q4 and the full year.\n\nRodney Gonsalves\n\nInterim CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, VP & Corporate Controller\n\nThanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will provide additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as walk through the income statement and cover other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.74 billion, above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 6.1%, while reported growth was 10.1%. Currency had a favorable impact of 2.1%, which was 1.5 better than what we estimated as part of our guidance. M&A contributed 1.9%, in line with our expectations.\nGross margins in Q3 came in at 53.1%, down year-on-year, driven by currency, tariffs and the impact of downtime to expand capacity of BIOVECTRA, as Padraig mentioned earlier.\nOperating margin was 25.1% in Q3 and has been consistent across the year in increasingly challenging conditions. Ignite is enabling us to translate top line growth into bottom line results while we continue to invest in innovation and growth.\nAs Padraig indicated, margins were below expectations. We've seen roughly equal impact from 3 areas. First, our higher revenue volume drove up net tariff costs as we shipped additional products and backfill logistics centers to support Q4 growth, even while full tariff mitigation is still on track for FY '26. Next, we increased variable pay expectations with higher awards driven by stronger business performance consistent with our pay-for-performance culture.\nFinally, we invested incremental commercial spend required to support short- and long-term revenue growth, including for critical product launches and improving our geographical coverage. For Q4, we are targeting a sequential operating margin improvement of approximately 230 basis points. We expect most of this improvement to come from leveraging our fixed costs as we drive another sequential increase in volume.\nWe are also getting meaningful contribution from both excellent margin conversion on the significant step-up in CDMO revenue in Q4 and delivering another step-up in Ignite benefits with a partial offset due to higher tariff costs.\nNow moving below the line, we had $6 million of income, while our tax rate of 12% was as expected, and we had 285 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.37. That was at the high end of our expectations and grew 4% from a year ago.\nNow let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash was $362 million in the quarter, down versus last year as working capital was up on volume growth and tariff-related inventory build. We also incurred severance costs related to our organizational efficiency efforts. Additionally, we invested $103 million in capital expenditures. We purchased 85 million shares and paid out $71 million in dividends during the quarter. And we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.9, so we continue to have a very strong balance sheet.\nNow let's move on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.82 billion to $1.84 billion. This represents an increase of 4.8% to 6% on a core basis and 7.1% to 8.3% on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are expected to be 0.2% and 2.1% tailwinds, respectively.\nAlso, to help you with your models, I want to provide you with additional details on expectations for growth in our end markets during the fourth quarter. In Pharma, we're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth with stable to improving conditions. In Chemicals & Advanced Materials, we're guiding high single-digit growth with another quarter of healthy capital investment expected. In Diagnostics & Clinical, as well as in Food, we expect mid-single-digit growth. Finally, we expect very low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics and mid-single-digit decline in Academia & Government as those markets face a difficult compare for U.S. federal spending at the end of the fiscal year.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.57 and $1.60 ,representing leveraged earnings growth of 7.5% to 9.6%. We expect a 12% tax rate, $9 million in other income and 284 million diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to the full year. As Padraig mentioned earlier, we are raising our revenue outlook. We now expect our full year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.91 billion to $6.93 billion. This represents an increase of 4.3% to 4.6% on a core basis and 6.2% to 6.5% on a reported basis. Currency is now expected to represent a small headwind for the year, while we expect a 2% revenue impact from M&A.\nOur full year EPS guidance is now $5.56 and to $5.59, unchanged at the midpoint versus our prior guidance, and we continue to offset additional tariff costs across the second half. This represents a year-on-year increase of 5.1% to 5.7%.\nFor clarity, let me briefly summarize the updated tariff assumptions that we incorporated in our FY '25 guidance. Based on the rates currently in place, we are now anticipating $20 million net cost for the year, up from the minimal impact we guided in May. This increase is due to our better-than-expected revenue performance across the second half as well as the 50% tariff increase on imports from Europe announced at the beginning of the month. Strong demand for our LC products that are currently produced in Europe until U.S.-based production begin to scale later this quarter, also amplifies the impact of the recent European tariff increase.\nFinally, for your modeling, we are now projecting an increase of other income and expense to $26 million in income, along with a 12% tax rate for the year and 285 million diluted shares outstanding.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nThanks, Rodney. These strong results are a testament to the progress we've made as a company over the past year. We are encouraged by the growth momentum we have created and look forward to building on that success next quarter and into the future.\nThank you for your attention. I'll hand over now to Parmeet to kick off for Q&A. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now?",

Agilent delivered strong second quarter results in a highly dynamic market environment. Revenue of $1.67 billion for the second quarter represented growth of 6% reported and up 5.3% core compared with the second quarter of 2024. Operating margin was a solid 25.1% as we absorbed some incremental tariff costs. We also delivered EPS of $1.31, growing 7% compared with the second quarter of 2024. Though revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.\nOur performance was driven by growth across markets and regions, speaking to the diversity of our business. We also saw another quarter of building momentum in instruments with our book-to-bill ratio again greater than 1. Thank you to the Agilent team for delivering these results by tirelessly going above and beyond for our customers. No matter where I travel in the world, our customers consistently say the same thing. The Agilent team is second to none and for that reason, they want to increase their partnership and collaboration with us even more, even during a challenging macro environment. These conditions have proved the efficacy of our 3-year Ignite transformation, which is the execution of our strategy. We're already leveraging Ignite to create an enterprise operating model that has resulted in multiple early wins, including tariff mitigation. More on that in a moment.\nFirst, let me tell you why our Q2 was so strong. All regions grew in the quarter, Americas grew low single digits, EMEA grew mid-single digits, and China led the way at 10% growth, exceeding our expectation, while the rest of Asia grew high single digits. China saw stable demand conditions sequentially, while a favorable Lunar New Year comparison helped year-on-year growth. In Asia, India delivered high teens growth, India is a long-term high-growth, innovation-driven market, which is why we've opened our first India solution center there this month. The center showcases Agilent's expertise across disciplines to deliver end-to-end solutions in sectors such as GLP-1 analysis, emerging food and environmental contaminant analysis and PFAS detection. We also delivered mid- to high single-digit growth in all end markets, except academia and government, which declined modestly with strong results in Asia moderating the expected softness in the U.S.\nPharma grew 6% at the high end of expectations, led by small molecule growing low double digits. Biopharma continues to recover at a slower pace, growing low single digits as we continue to see funding challenges in small and midsized biotech, primarily in the U.S. Within biopharma, NASD was a standout, growing high single digits in Q2 and we're looking forward to double-digit growth from NASD in the second half of the year.\nIn addition, while not yet part of core growth, our BIOVECTRA business performed well, exceeding guidance. BIOVECTRA's capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets. For example, GLP-1s and compact chemistries with terrific medium and long-term growth potential. We are very excited about the combined offerings of NASD and BIOVECTRA. Diagnostics and Clinical grew 8% ahead of expectations on strong performance of our pathology business in the Americas and Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew 6% on strong PFAS testing demand globally. PFAS testing remains strong for Agilent globally, and we see it continuing to expand into other end markets such as food and chemical and advanced Materials.\nIn Q2, PFAS grew more than 70% year-over-year globally, with Europe and China more than doubling their business. PFAS provided an incremental 80 basis points to our growth in the quarter and is now annualizing to well over $100 million. We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects globally in PFAS as regulations and standards continue to be put in place. For PFAS testing, our Infinity III and our 6495B system is the most sensitive and robust solution. The Agilent team has a deep understanding of customer challenges and how we can help them with their testing needs through delivering integrated workflow solutions, productivity and new modality application development. We are tracking over 350 regulations globally and are very confident in the continued momentum in this emerging $1 billion addressable market by 2030.\nIn Chemicals and Advanced Materials, revenue grew 4% with high single-digit growth in Advanced Materials, while Chemical and Energy was up low single digits globally. Overall, we saw growth ex China offset by low single-digit decline in China. Lower oil prices are net positive to the Chem business, given it drives lower input prices to our chemical business, which is 4x bigger than energy. Food grew 8%, benefiting from strength in Asia through government-funded technology refresh. Our smallest end market, academia and government declined only 2% in the quarter, better-than-expected performance in the U.S. and globally.\nGiven we were ahead of others talking about potential U.S. funding impacts in our first quarter earnings call and did better than expected in Q2, we feel we already have adequately captured any variability looking forward. When looking holistically across Agilent, we continue to make investments in our digital ecosystem, such as our next-generation e-commerce platform so that we can offer an outstanding customer experience. Those investments are paying off as we grew digital orders by 12% year-over-year to $295 million.\nI also want to highlight ACG's 9% growth this quarter, which exceeded expectations. ACG's performance was led by strong growth in automation, services and consumables. For the first time in several quarters, we saw both on-demand and installation services return to growth. These results keep us on track with the long-term commitments we outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day in December, including 5% to 7% core revenue growth, expanding margins 50 to 100-plus basis points annually and driving double-digit EPS growth.\nWe have momentum at Agilent. Over the past 12 months, my first year as CEO, the Agilent team has accomplished a lot. We built a formidable senior leadership team that is working in lockstep to maximize Agilent resources to drive shareholder value. We've evolved our enterprise strategy to be market first and realigned our businesses to our markets. We acquired BIOVECTRA for roughly $1 billion to expand our CDMO capabilities, and we have moved from planning to execution in Ignite.\nBefore providing further details than Ignite, I want to pause here and thank our Agilent team members for how quickly they have adapted to change and the company's higher ambition. It is no small feat to transform a company and I've been impressed by our colleagues' passion for our mission and vision and to increase [indiscernible] to delight customers so that Agilent continued to win in the market. These team members are leading Ignite, an initiative that is already yielding incredible results.\nThose incredible results include: strengthening our strategic pricing capabilities and implementing enterprise-wide pricing initiatives. In 6 months, we already have exceeded the full year price contribution from last year and are expecting at least 100 basis points of price realization in 2025, with expectations for an even greater impact in 2026 and beyond. Improving organization agility and efficiency by flattening management layers and increasing spans of control by 30% to improve our organization health and become a nimbler company. Additionally, we expect to deliver annualized savings of about $80 million starting in the second half of the fiscal year.\nCentralizing our procurement under a Chief Procurement Officer and adopting an integrated enterprise-wide approach to vendor management, we already see strong momentum exceeding our internal savings targets, ramping in the second half of this year while being essentially in mitigating tariff expense with our suppliers. This is with projected procurement annualized savings exceeding $50 million by the end of 2025 and establishing a strong foundation for additional gains in 2026. Ignite has become the backbone of our operating system, enabling faster decision-making, more scalable growth and over $130 million of profit for fiscal year 2025. It is our institutional engine for long-term value creation.\nCenter to value creation is our continued commitment to innovation. I'm proud to share 3 impactful new products that demonstrate that commitment. In our cell analysis portfolio, we just launched the Seahorse XF Flex Analyzer, with its world-class leading sensitivity, versatility, intuitive design and compatibility with treaty models, the XF Flex empowers more researchers than ever before to explore [indiscernible] metabolism with confidence. And at the 73rd ASMS conference next week, we will launch our latest innovation in Liquid Chromatography Mass Detection, our new InfinityLab Pro iQ Series offers unparalleled sensitivity, speed and efficiency making it the ideal choice for customers analyzing complex biomolecules in settings where performance and lab productivity are key.\nAt ASMS, we will also showcase our enhanced 8850 GC now coupled with the power of our market-leading GC/MS that enables our customers to do more with less. We've reduced the 8850s' footprint by 50% and increased throughput up to 5x while lowering its energy usage by 45% compared with a conventional benchtop GC. We also continue to have success with our Infinity III LC in orders, funnel and our attach rates of service and consumables. We're seeing this with success, both geographically with robust growth in India, a particular highlight and across all end markets. With our top customers calling out the Infinity III superior performance, intelligence and task automation capabilities.\nTo help further drive Agilent's internal and external innovation engine, I'm delighted to announce August Specht is joining Agilent next month as our Chief Technology Officer. August has spent over 25 years in senior R&D roles in the life sciences industry, welcome August.\nIgnite also gave us a significant head start on tariff mitigation enabling the immediate creation of our tariff task force that has allowed us to make changes that will maintain our market strength regardless of tariff rates. We are proactively managing tariff exposure by taking several targeted actions, including focusing on specific product lines and production sites rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach, we are diversifying our supply chain by leveraging our extensive global sourcing capabilities and manufacturing network ensuring we're geographically even closer to customers, implementing strategic pricing initiatives around the globe that protect our market competitiveness. While we remain vigilant amid geopolitical developments, our localized manufacturing proactive tariff mitigation and a diversified customer base gives us greater resilience and agility globally than many of our peers.\nThrough our tariff task force enabled by our Ignite operating model, we feel that we are able to mitigate most of the impact in 2025 and fully mitigate in 2026 even when considering recent developments on the U.S. EU tariffs. With the task force, we can create targeted analytics in a matter of hours, not days that identify key supply chain and commercial opportunities that will allow us to maximize our tariff mitigation efforts. Our top priority is ensuring we minimize tariff impacts on our customers and that our customers have the trusted Agilent products, solutions and services they need. Looking ahead, we are confident that the long-term fundamentals and secular growth drivers of our markets remain strong.\nFor the year, we are maintaining our core growth rate of 2.5% to 3.5% while incorporating favorable currency movements. And leveraging our Ignite program, we are fully absorbing all unmitigated FY '25 tariff costs and maintaining our full year EPS guidance. While our results this quarter exceeded expectations, we believe it's important to remain disciplined in our outlook given the ongoing uncertainty in macro environment and geopolitical landscape. We are committed to maintaining guidance that is both credible and achievable, and we continue to prioritize long-term value creation.\nBob will now share further details about our Q2 guidance. Bob?\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our full year and third quarter guidance.\nAs Padraig mentioned, Q2 revenue was $1.67 billion, above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 5.3% while reported growth was 6%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.6%, which was 0.5 point better than estimated as the dollar weakened during the quarter. M&A also contributed 2.3% coming in nicely ahead of expectations.\nNow let me talk about our performance by business group. The Agilent CrossLab Group reported revenue of $713 million, growing 9% which was ahead of our expectations, double-digit growth in consumables and automation and high single-digit growth in services drove ACG's performance. Our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Market Group reported revenue of $654 million in the quarter, growing 3%. Core growth was driven by our Pathology business and NASD, both which delivered high single-digit growth in our LC and LC/MS instruments that grew mid-single digits. Our cell analysis business returned to growth, up low single digits. Performance was partially offset by an expected mid-single-digit decline in our NGS business. And our Applied Markets Group reported $301 million in the quarter, flat versus last year on a core growth basis. Growth in spectroscopy and GC/MS was offset by some timing-related declines in gas chromatography.\nBefore getting into the rest of the P&L, I want to cover additional details on Q2 revenue that were influenced by the April tariff announcements, primarily in China. While there was no revenue impact to Agilent overall, we did see some shifts by group in the quarter. Specifically, we saw roughly $15 million of in-country ACG lab consumables revenue pulled forward into Q2 from Q3. However, this was offset by longer processing time through customs on some select instrumentation in both AMG and LDG. Again, this did not impact our overall revenue for Q2 or our Q3 outlook but we have taken that into account by group looking forward, which I'll talk to in a minute. It is also important to note, we've seen a return to normal customs processing times here in May.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.1% in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations after accounting for 55 basis points of incremental tariff costs. It is down versus last year, with the delta being equally distributed among tariffs, currency and product mix. We drove operating margins of 25.1%, while flat versus last year, excluding the 55 basis points of incremental tariffs, it would have been an increase year-on-year. So overall, a strong showing. Below the line, we had $2 million of income while our tax rate of 11.5% was better than expected. And we had 285 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.\nPutting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.31, that was ahead of our expectations and up 7% from a year ago, growing faster than core revenue. This is a very good result in the face of the dynamic macro environment which is a testament to the Agilent team, forging close collaborative partnerships with our customers.\nNow let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $221 million in the quarter and we invested $114 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $165 million in shares and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. And we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1, so we continue to have a very strong balance sheet.\nNow let's move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and third quarter. As Padraig mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our core growth outlook for the year, and increasing our reported revenue guidance by $50 million to reflect incremental FX benefit since our last guide. This results in an increase to our full year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.73 billion to $6.81 billion, increasing reported growth to 3.4% to 4.6%. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.1 percentage point headwind for the year versus a prior 1.9% headwind, while our M&A guidance is unchanged at plus 2% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Core growth is still expected to be between 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. We believe this is a prudent way to manage considering the dynamic macro environment.\nNow to help you with your models, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on our end markets. In Pharma, we are monitoring the progress of U.S. pricing policy proposals but are not seeing a change in customer behavior. As a result, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit growth for the year with the second half of the year continuing to show steady improvement versus the first half. For Diagnostics and Clinical, given Q2's performance, we now expect growth to be towards the upper end of mid-single digits. And we expect growth for both Chemicals and Advanced Materials and Food to continue to be in the range of low to mid-single digits, while the Environmental and Forensics market is a solid mid-single-digit growth on PFAS strength.\nAnd lastly, as a reminder, Academia and Government is our smallest market at 8% of total revenue, with NIH-related research representing only about 1% of revenue. We are maintaining our outlook from Q1 of a mid-single-digit decline in total with the U.S. market being the driver. While we performed much better than we expected in Q2, we feel this is a prudent approach for the year. We are also maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $5.54 to $5.61 while covering the incremental tariff costs that I'll explain in more detail in a moment. This represents a year-on-year increase of 4.7% to 6%.\nFor clarity, let me briefly summarize the tariff assumptions we've incorporated into our FY '25 guidance. Based on the tariff rates that are currently in place, we estimate that the gross incremental tariff exposure in the second half of our fiscal year is $50 million. This is on top of the roughly $10 million we have already absorbed in the first half of our fiscal year, 30% of the exposure is represented by trade between the U.S. and China, about evenly split. Of the remaining 70%, 30 percentage points is from the EU into the U.S. and the remaining 40% is from the rest of the world into the U.S. As Padraig mentioned, we have mobilized our team using the Ignite operating model to quickly move our procurement and supply chains to minimize the tariffs and build inventory. We are using a combination of supply chain moves like moving LC production into the U.S., surcharges and some of the Ignite driven savings that or previously highlighted to offset the incremental costs.\nImportantly, we expect our actions to fully mitigate the cost in fiscal 2026. The tariff landscape continues to be dynamic and hard to predict. However, given the recent news of potentially increasing tariffs on EU sourced products to 50% as early as July 9, we felt it is important to frame that exposure. If implemented on July 9 we estimate that would add another $40 million in gross exposure in the second half of the year. But through additional pricing mitigations and the inventory we've built up, we anticipate the net impact would be minimal for the year. This is the power of our tariff task force. It enables us to address tariffs at the enterprise level and align Agilent's key senior leaders so we can quickly leverage our strong and diverse supply chain footprint and adjust to the market-driven approach of our unified commercial team.\nFinally, for your modeling, we are now projecting an increase in other income and expenses to $15 million in income along with a 12% tax rate for the year and 285 million diluted shares outstanding.\nMoving to the third quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.645 billion to $1.675 billion. This range represents an increase of 1.7% to 3.6% growth on a core basis and an increase of 4.2% to 6.1% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 0.6% tailwind and M&A impact is expected to be a 1.9% benefit in the quarter. Again, while the Q2 stocking the logistics dynamics I mentioned earlier do not affect the total revenue in Q3, we do see it playing out differently by group. For that reason, we thought it's helpful to provide a perspective on group core growth guidance in Q3. Given the Q2 impacts, we see LDG growing mid-single digits and both ACG and AMG growing low single digits. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.35 and $1.37, representing growth of 2.3% to 3.8%.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nThanks, Bob. Before I close, I want to thank our retiring Board member, Heidi Kunz, for many years of service with Agilent, and I want to welcome Pascal Soriot and Judy Gawlik Brown to the Board. Pascal is CEO of AstraZeneca; and Judy is currently Founder and CEO of Downtown Advisory after holding senior leadership positions at Amgen and Perrigo. Both bring decades of global leadership experience from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and health care sectors with a proven track record in strategy, innovation, operations and finance. I look forward to working with you both.\nIt's an exciting time to be part of the Agilent growth story, to be part of building on our foundational strength of being an established leader in $80 billion markets driven by secular growth. Having leading market share and sustainable competitive advantage to our intense customer focus and reaccelerating growth through innovation and market share gains. And we continue to look at the long term. As Bob mentioned, we have strooil and gasbalance sheet and remain focused on augmenting our internal innovation with external growth opportunities. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities of all sizes that are aligned with our strategy we explained in December and will further build this great company.\nIn a highly dynamic macro environment, Agilent is excelling. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year 2025 commitments and in our long-term trajectory towards financial framework we explained at Investor Day, with Ignite scaling and our pace of innovation accelerating, Agilent is well positioned to outperform regardless of the near-term market dynamics. After 1 year as CEO, I'm even more energized by what we're accomplishing at Agilent, and we're only getting started.\nThank you for your attention. I'll now hand it over to Parmeet to kick off our Q&A. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.",

Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings.\nRevenue of $1.578 billion declined 4.4% an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially as the actions we announced last quarter started to deliver. And we remain untracked to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance.\nAs a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS. And we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities by a reference in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus, we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately, in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma, and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment.\nAs you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers, and competitors, are not standing still, neither are we. We're accelerating our pace of innovation and execution so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS, and advanced materials.\nI continue to meet and connect with employees, customers, and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives and how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders.\nWe are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating, our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th.\nNow let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end-markets accept Academia & Government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high single digits, slightly better than our expectations, and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecules. Our leadership and providing workflow solutions for PFAS continue to show strong performance in the environmental market.\nGeographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions perform roughly in line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3, with services plus consumers growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%. While the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental and Forensics.\nConsumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digits. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that has customers reached their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently while using up to 30% less powered than other GCs and has a much smaller footprint.\nMoving on to the Agilent Cross-Lab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter up mid-single digits. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year but showed, meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%. Demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital-equipment environment.\nThe continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach the productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group close to $385 million in revenue representing an 8% decline. The Pathology Group mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in cell analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD's stepdown sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step up sequentially in Q4.\nIn the face of a constrained CAPEX environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent, in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions that speak to our focus, on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers.\nIn late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in our legal nucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities, microbial fermentation, antibody drug conjugates and high potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene-editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year of 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year.\nThe BIOVECTRA Acquisition remains on track to be closed by the end of the year, and we're looking forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announce the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a startup that uses Artificial Intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense, team, who already is part of Agilent.\nDuring the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My Green Lab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue, and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 most Sustainable Companies in the world.\nBob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nThanks, Padraig, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and fourth quarter guidance.\nQ3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double digits, or down mid single digits excluding an NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid single digits, and was led by growth in Europe.\nServices and Pharma continues to perform well, growing high single digits. In Chemical and Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5% with growth in America's offset by softness in China. Our advanced material sub-segment performed better driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia & Government are smallest market can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the America's region. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid single digit growth in Pathology offset by ongoing softness in Genomics.\nIn Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4% another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall beating our expectations while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially driven by growth in Services and Consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity which is encouraging.\nNow, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Growth margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year ago but up 40 basis-points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improves sequentially and was better than expected. Despite the dampened demand we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost savings by the end of the fiscal year.\nBelow the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had 291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset and Q3 of last year.\nNow, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2 we ramped up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends for a total of $653 million return to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4.\nWe ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY '25.\nBecause of our Q3 results we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined or a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline, of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate, and 292 million fully deluded shares outstanding.\nWe have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance, and $0.6 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth, on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis points.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance, and 287 million deluded shares outstanding for the quarter.\nNow I'd like to turn a call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThese are exciting times at Agilent. With a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer-force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market-leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win trough both organic and inorganic growth, and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's greatest workplaces, 2024 list.\nAgain, thank you for joining today's call. I am energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each day the team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress.\nParmeet, over to you for Q&A.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nThanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks, for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just digging in a little bit on the LSAG where you had a pretty solid beat. It looks like that was driven primarily by consumables and services. So, I'm curious if you can give any more color on what instruments did. I know you had a book-to-bill above 1. But just how does that inform your view as we go into '25, on the replacement cycle, specifically large Biopharma demand and how that might impact your view on when that replacement cycle starts kicking in?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, thanks a lot, Matt. Maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct. We saw very, very promising growth in both consumers and services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any cancellations.\nBut what I would say is that deep closure times are still elevated. So, we're not at this point seeing any budget approach toward the end of the year, and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that close. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, thanks, Matt for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we're very pleased. Actually, both our consumables business as well as our instrument business before better, than expected in the quarter. We were down down 7% in total. Our consumables business was actually up mid single digits towards the high end there, and our instrument business was down low double digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side. Again, this quarter, which was very encouraging.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nGot it. Thanks for that, very helpful. And then just on Academic & Government, I know you talked about it, you talked about it for a while, how volatile that can be, but just given sort of the-- two quarters in a row of sort of negative performance there, and you called out Europe and China specifically, are there any kind of durable trends you're seeing either in funding or in demand that you think might be more persistent in that specific end-market as we go through Q4 and then as we look into 2025?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nNo, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. So, it was a really tough compare. And I think quite what we're seeing as funding remains stable in most regions. And except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense. But I would say no major changes in that market.\n\nMatt Sykes\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of a Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nPerfect. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, you guys. I wanted to dig into NASD a little bit. Obviously, we had some positive announcements intra-quarter with the HELIOS-B read out. You mentioned that NASD stepped on sequentially as expected, and then you said you're expecting that to then step up into fiscal 4Q. So, could you unpack all that for us a little bit? How should we think about the magnitude of the step up into 4Q and then given some of the updated data readouts that we got intra-quarter. How does that underpin your assumptions on NASD next year, and then also long-term?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, look, at I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon who's on the call here as well. We've seen with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customer's progress on those patches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4. So, we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. And the long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of open down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon?\n\nSimon May\n\nExecutive VP & President of the Life Science Group, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll just echo what Padraig said. I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between all the booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty, strong bookings activity. So, as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there.\nSo, I'd really just characterized Q3 is in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned HELIO, so I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. But certainly no impacts in the remainder of '24 and unlikely in '25 as well.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, hey Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up. We had talked as Simon and Padraig had get said, we'd done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in house and we're still on track for the long--the full year estimate for NASD. And that's incorporated into our guidance.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nGreat, that's helpful. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to dig a little bit more into 4Q guidance and what that means in terms of exit rate into 2025. So, I appreciate some of your comments earlier. You highlighted in that question, and you're not really assuming a budget flash for your fiscal year ends in October.\nBut I guess how should investors look at this 4Q number on an organic growth basis of that down 2% up 1% on the range. And how do we look at that translating into 2025. If I look at consensus right now, consensus is just shy of 5% organic on 2025, 3 is also nearing that double digit EPS growth. So, I appreciate it is still a little bit early for you guys to formally give us 2025 expectations. But what do you think about exit rate and where sell-side numbers are right now?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY '25. But what I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. But we improved here in Q3 300 basis points, sequentially, we're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY '25.\nSo, and we do expect while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the--or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed. And so, we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY '25.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Donnelly\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nHey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Bob, maybe one for you. Just on China, how you guys are thinking about the region there. It's not like it's down 11% like I'm a little bit better on the revenue side sequentially. It sounds like you got lab activity maybe looking a little bit better. Can you talk about expectations into year-end?\nSome of your peers have suggested you could see a bit of a pause on the capital side into calendar year end as we wait for a little clarity on the stimulus. Just how you guys are thinking about China. Again, not only into your fiscal year, but just into the year-end on the calendar side. And what's your view in terms of you really see a little bit of air pocket here until the stimulus dollars get firmed up?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. Patrick, is a great question. We had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last--just a quarter ago here, really on the bid activity primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the midterm here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY '25 event probably, but what we are seeing is more activity there. I think it's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well. Our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in an activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So, it's still dampened demand, and we did see that impact in Academia and Government. That was the biggest impact in China. But we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery.\n\nAngelica Riemann\n\nYeah, Bob, I'll just add, in China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China.\n\nPatrick Donnelly\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nOkay, that's encouraging. And then maybe another one for you, Bob. As you think about the margin construct as we work our way into year-end into '25, maybe just remind us some of the moving pieces to think about high level as we look ahead to next year. Obviously, the cost out program seems to be progressing well to a point where the margins came in nicely here in 3Q. Yes, maybe just the moving pieces as we go ahead to next year without talking too much about the top-line, obviously, the volume matters there. But just kind of down the P&L how to think about some of the margin outlook for next year would be helpful.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, I think as we talked about--Patrick, is a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items. And I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. And we're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental analyze savings that by the end of '24. So, there will still be a tailwind obviously going into '25 for that benefit offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that.\nIf I think about it at the highest level what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leverage earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing and certainly our ACG business here this last quarter just phenomenal profit contribution. And I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that'll set us up nicely for next year.\nSo, think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in in FY '25, partially offset by merit and some of the activities, and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures. And so, we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So, stay tuned on that as well.\n\nPatrick Donnelly\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nOkay, that's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Wanted to dig into some of these instrument trends a little bit more. I was wondering if you could talk about just what you were seeing across some of the big categories like LC, LC/MS, GC spectroscopy, any color on how those performed?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYes, I mean, in general terms, Jack, I think customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged, with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. So, we see a lot of stability in that. So, it's still very challenged. And I would say that our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So, I think that goes across most of the markets and as you see going forward our results and CST & Services going mid single digits and both both very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So, we're seeing slow, but steady improvement.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, hey, just to follow on to that. I think one of the things, as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instance is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected, overall LSAG instruments were down low double digit.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nYes. Were all the categories kind of right around there?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nI would say if you looked at the LC and LC/MS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nOkay. And then just as one end-market follow-up. I was curious in CAM in the third quarter. So, it was down 5%. It was a little bit below what I was thinking. Is there anything just within the different categories within that end-market that softened a little bit relative to what you were thinking a few months ago?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, so, you're correct. It was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of over production in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in Service and Consumers both combined at 7% increase. But there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments. And I think CAPEX spending remains slightly challenged there.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThat makes sense. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. One, I guess for Bob, if you look at the guidance change or the last three months, NASD China biopharma, those have been the big categories. I think the guide assumes NASD double down double digits in fiscal '24, China down high single double digits in a biopharma down. Which of these is expected to get better next year? What is getting better or worse? And is there a first half versus second half dynamics that we should be aware of?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. And, we raised the midpoint of guidance $15 million on revenue and $0.03 EPS. And we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly. And that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So, while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end-market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving, is still difficult.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC\n\nUnderstood. And maybe on that Q4 commentary for guidance implies, I think up 6% or 7%, which seems generally in line with your historical sequential step up from 3Q. Is the booking trends that we saw, and NASD trends we saw, does it support that historical, I guess, seasonality? Because I think where the Street is debating on is, that historical seasonality doesn't bake in some year-end budget flush or what is baked into that sequential step-up?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYes. So, I think what we're seeing is that it's--we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. We see a budget flush, it's on top, and that would be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC\n\nFantastic. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nHey guys, question on BIOVECTRA and maybe just synergies with the rest of the NASD business. How do you think about--does that change views on capacity and maybe just talk a little bit about how much of their BIOVECTRA business is clinical versus commercial? And any kind of emerging modalities that you're adding here?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll start Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So, we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great fit that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on current NASD modalities around anti-sense, and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so, we're very happy with that. So, there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So, I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business.\n\nSimon May\n\nExecutive VP & President of the Life Science Group, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\nYeah, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. So, Steriles & Fill/Finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of requests from our customers over the past few years for that capability and from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high-potency APIs. There's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing.\nSo, I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So, I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CAPEX and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then a follow-up on China. You had the pull-forward dynamic in the first quarter, $15 million, if that were back in 2Q, I think you were effectively flat, maybe down a little bit. First, is that the right assumption? What are you actually embedding in 4Q for China in guidance? And then how do you think about the return to growth in '25? Could you see that in the first half of the year?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, hey, Tycho, your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so, that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4 basically none, but more into Q5. But the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped up, and then I think the activity that we're seeing in Services and Consumables, we're expecting that to continue.\nIt's probably too early to tell next year for China. But I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is, we're expecting a low double digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that. And it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement.\nCertainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that'll be in our first and second quarters most likely. But we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It'll be over time because this stimulus is over a three-year period.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nI understand. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nYeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Instrumentation growth, obviously an important question. Last quarter you lowered expectations, meaningfully, but again, book-to-bill was strong more than one. Again, this quarter it is more than 1. And I think you said that last quarter was the first time you saw growth in the market after seven quarters. So, that looks like it's continued again into the quarter.\nSo, just maybe help us understand instrument where we sit on instrumentation? And what sort of recovery are you seeing here in August? And what gives you sort of confidence that the instrumentation should continue to bounce back into 2025 as well?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, look, at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts, there's--we're seeing that more positive than negatives in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So, there is drivers within the markets that are positive.\nBut overall, I would say it's slow and steady, and we're treating it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nNo, I think you're spot on. And we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So, if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimates.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nOkay, thanks. And recent drug pricing negotiation with Medicare on the first drugs are out. Obviously, IRA is having an impact. But over the next three years, annually, 15 drugs will be negotiated and that probably leads to another set of impacts. So, what are you hearing from your large pharma customers? And overall, how are they thinking about the R&D spend, and the spend that they currently have on Agilent?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. There's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see over time is it probably even out in terms of impact.\nWhat isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs, we see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, et cetera. So, we need to wait and see. But having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years, the enormous amount of spend that has happened, and we're seeing that normalized now, of course, in the installed base and coming out of that in '25.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners LLC\n\nOkay, sir. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on--maybe this is what Puneet was just getting at, but you called out in your prepare remarks a couple of times that with biopharma, small molecule held up a little bit better, or small molecule did a little bit better than large molecule, I assume. Just wondering if you could delve into that a little bit more. Was that a particular instrument class or modality that drove that? Does that have to do with budget cycles? Just what you're seeing there, and why is such a difference in the molecule side.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right. I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single-digits in the quarter, which was better than expected. Actually, and in Europe it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to--you can only hold on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement, cycle inflection just yet. But every quarter of these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production, and that continues to be long-term positive trend.\nSo, that would be our core LC franchise. And then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits, and you take NASD out, we're at mid-single-digits as well, not as--it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So, both of them are actually, when you take out the kind of the one time unique aspect of NASD, performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nAlso, I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules, so that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nOkay, both of the answers are really helpful. And then from my follow-up, I want to lean a little bit more on BIOVECTRA. I mean, everything to kind of wait out there for the rationale, and the financial deal certainly makes sense. But I'm just curious, you've had a presence in some some CDMO-Type capabilities in the past. Just wondering, how far are you going to lean into this?\nAnd what I'm alluding to is obviously one of your large traditional tools vendors has a CDMO business has been in that business for a number of years now. And there's a lot of talk of the benefits of having both the instruments, the consumables and the services business on tail end. Is this something you're going to continue to grow over time? It's BIOVECTRA like a beachhead acquisition, and we should expect more investment down the road?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll start and maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, it's going to be really centered around where strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets, and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA ticks all of those boxes. And it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So, we see that continuing.\nAnd so, we're really excited about it. But we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course, and it's had a lot of capital investments over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But, Simon?\n\nSimon May\n\nExecutive VP & President of the Life Science Group, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\nNot much to add, really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the R&A, modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely. As we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space. And that's probably all we can say at this point.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just back to China, the down 11% was a bit better than we were looking for. Can you just unpack what specifically got better in the quarter, given the guidance cut that you made last quarter, maybe either by customer type or by product type? And then just to clear up, like, so, your guidance for China, I know it was down double digits, has that changed at all? Have you improved that? So, that's my first question.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full year and guidance, down low double digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma. And it gets back to what we were talking about before the activity, both on the services side, performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so, when we were down, close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3. And I would expect that to continue into Q4.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nAnd then, sorry to go back to NASD, but there just been a lot of questions from investors after the turn of events here today, in terms of that business really slowing a lot. Can you--did you say what it did actually in the quarter? I didn't hear the number, kind of year-over-year, what did NASD do in the quarter?\nAnd then kind of if we take your guidance full year, I know you said step-up, could you just give us some clarity on the quarter? And then any additional color on clinical versus commercial? It sounds like your bookings are improving so that portends well for the outlook. But just trying to unpack like what's going on right now in the quarter. Thank you.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nDan, what I would say is we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So, we had been signaling a step-down in Q3, and we actually did better than we were expecting there. The full year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive. In terms of activity, and we're starting to see some of our costumers, the read outs of some activities, which is more a harbinger of long term opportunity, versus short term, but if anything, it was a little better than we expected.\nSo, I don't want anyone to take away that it wasn't--even though it was down in the quarter we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance. And we're still on track for the full year estimate that we we had coming into the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nCatherine Schulte\n\nHey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just could talk about growth rates by segment for the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe your assumptions for instrumentation versus consumables and services in the fourth quarter?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. Catherine, this is Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups we would expect to do better. And if I went by group, LSAG would be--we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall, and with the instrument side still probably down slightly, or would be down slightly. DGG down mid single digits, and ACG up mid-single digits, towards the high end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So, all three of those actually performing better than we were in Q3.\n\nCatherine Schulte\n\nPerfect. And then maybe going back to small molecule. Nice to see the improvement there. What was just small molecule performance excluding China? I know you said Europe grew, but just curious to get more color on what you're seeing elsewhere.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYes. I think what we're seeing is Europe was a stand out in small molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on it. And what we did see from the small molecule side, we did see pretty good growth and services as well as has had that number. But I think overall, Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. So, we were down mid single digits, and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low single digits everywhere else so.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Waldman",
    "content2": "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. So, a couple for you, Padraig or Bob, maybe first to follow up on your assumption for no budget flushing impact on pharm instrumentation, is that just a function of the timing of your quarter relative to calendar year-end buying from these customers or are there other things you're seeing that are leaving you on the sidelines as a relates to end of your pharma spending?\nAnd then a related question was curious any high level thoughts you had on '25 based on planning conversations you're having with pharma accounts. Are you thinking next year should be a return to normal growth type year and pharma instrument budgets, as budgets are reset or is it more of a gradual recovery or return to normal over a couple of year period? Any feedback that you're getting from accounts on that?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll take the first one and maybe hand off to Bob for the second one. I think, it's a year ago, and we were--people were talking about budget flushes, we didn't expect it, and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same at this time. Of course, our year ends at the end of October, so if we do see any activity will be in Q1 '25.\nWhy do we see this? Is because we're very close to our customers, we know exactly where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So, we're not expecting of anything substantial at the end of the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year slow steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take a second question, Bob?\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. Josh, on '25 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say, but what our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY '25, and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in '25. That's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two-to three-year estimate either, based on our conversations with our customers right now. So, it's probably in between.\n\nJosh Waldman\n\nGot it. Okay. And then just to follow-up on ACG, I was curious if you could provide a bit more context on the dynamics you're seeing there, especially interested in what you're seeing from an RFP and win rate dynamic in the contract of business. And then you mentioned, I think in the slide decks, benefiting from mix. I was wondering if you could flush that out a bit.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, I take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelique. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment and abroad product offerings and key markets that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of the systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow true to our results in spite of the CAPEX challenges all year.\nSo, the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So, I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica?\n\nAngelica Riemann\n\nYes. So, to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double digits. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are the mid teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and their waste reduction. So, we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. And Josh just on the comment on mix is when we have business on contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well.\n\nJosh Waldman\n\nGot it. Okay. Appreciate all the details.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nAnalyst, Cowen and Company, LLC\n\nHey guys, thanks for fitting me in. I know it's late in the call. That being said, I got three lightning round questions, which I'm going to rattle through and then listen to the answers. The first is on MAP. It's recurring revenue growth was up mid single digits in the quarter. It seems like instruments have to be down around 20% maybe more based on the numbers you reported in the 10-Q and Q3 of last year. Bob, I think you said in response to Matt Sykes' question, it was down low double digits. What are we missing? It's just not trying to be too picky here, but it just seems important in the context of assessing trends and what weight to put on your book-to-bill commentary. So, that's the first question.\nThe second is on China stimulus. Any change in dynamics regarding stalling either in terms of conversions or even cancellations. There's some scuttlebutt that there's been some recent changes as the shape of stimulus becomes a bit more clear. And then the third question is on 2025. If you exit 2024 with flattish core growth in Q4, that would obviously be a positive trend relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters.\nThat said, it would seem like if you draw a straight line that you'd be on track to exit 2025 at around call it 5% maybe 6% growth rather than growing mid single digits for the year. So, I think you need a fundamental improvement in overall market conditions and/or a real impact from China stimulus to get to mid singles for the year. I just want to see if any of my logic is flawed there. Thank you, and have a good night.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThat's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYeah, the comment that I had on instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double digits, consumables was up mid single digits for the total being down minus 7. So, that is--we do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So, down 20 is way too negative.\nI'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into the last one.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSVP, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nYeah, look at I think we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing in early days, we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days. As it trickles down to provinces as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that.\n\nRobert McMahon\n\nYes. And I think just the last one, real quick, it's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY '25 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd I'll now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nThanks Regina, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."

My name is Regina, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead. .\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Philip Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, our newly named President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann. President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.\nThis presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with the recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis.\nCore revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our cell analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements.\nDuring this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nThanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I want to begin by saying I'm incredibly honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to lead such a talented team. I truly believe the Agilent team is second to none and I'm energized about the future possibilities that lie ahead of us. I also want to take this time to welcome our new DGG President, Simon May to the Agilent team. Simon's diversified experience, strong technical skills and growth mindset will be a key asset in this role.\nSince starting earlier this month, Simon has hit the ground running, and I am really looking forward to him helping move DGG and Agilent forward. Before I talk about the quarterly results, I'd like to tell you how I spent my time since the announcement in February that I will become Agilent's CEO. I've been meeting and connecting with employees, customers and shareholders around the world to listen to their perspectives and how we should build on our strengths and evolve Agilent.\nWhat they have told me is clear, Agilent must become even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. This has really resonated with our employees and customers. As an energized Agilent team, we will evolve our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We will double down on our customer first culture, deepening our relationship to further enhance our market-leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry.\nNow let's talk about the Q2 results and outlook moving forward. In a challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered on expectations. In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $1.573 billion, a 7.4% decline. This was against a tough compare of 9.5% growth in Q2 of last year. While revenues declined in the quarter, our book-to-bill was greater than 1, and orders grew year-over-year for the first time in 7 quarters. Earnings per share of $1.22 beat our expectations and represented a 4% decline from the second quarter of 2023.\nNow looking forward, the market environment continues to be challenging, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. However, as we announced in our press release, this market recovery is not at the pace we anticipated when we provided guidance earlier in the year. As a result, we are reducing our market growth expectations and revising our full year core revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.5 billion and growth to decline between 4.3% and 5.4%. We now expect earnings per share to be between $5.15 and $5.25 for the year. We have responded quickly to the lower market growth expectations and are taking difficult, but necessary actions to streamline our cost structure.\nThese actions will allow us to invest in our most promising growth opportunities while also delivering incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. We are sharpening our focus on key growth vectors such as biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials, while also investing in our digital ecosystem, and accelerating our innovation to drive even faster execution. And we are leveraging our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our common stock across the third and 4 quarters, over and above our normal anti-dilutive repurchases. Bob will provide more details on our results and latest outlook in his remarks.\nGetting back to Q2 results. As expected, all end markets saw a declining revenue in Q2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe came in slightly ahead of expectations, while China lagged. Despite the challenging market conditions, our Agilent team stay close to our customers and continue to leverage our strong relationships with them to execute remarkably well while maintaining strong cost discipline. When we look at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $754 million in revenue, down 13%. The group saw a decline across all end markets and regions, with consumables being a bright spot. Consumables grew in the low single digits, driven by chemical and Advanced Materials, [indiscernible] and environmental and forensics. Also while relatively small, we continue to see strong growth in our pre-owned instrument business.\nThe LSAG team continues to innovate, introducing 2 new instruments this quarter that extend our applied markets leadership. First, our 7010D-GC triple quad instrument delivers exceptional sensitivity for customers in the environmental PFAS and advanced materials markets. Designed for analysis that demand the lowest limit of detection. And second is our 8850 GC, a distinguished new member of our market-leading GC portfolio. The 8850 is ultrafast in separation and colon speeds with design innovations that enable customers to run tests up to twice as fast as regular benchtop GC. And it's the smallest high-performance benchtop GC on the market. plus it's sustainable, using up to 30% less electricity power compared with a traditional benchtop GC.\nNow moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, which delivered revenue of $402 million for the quarter, up 5%. ACG grew across all end markets in every region except China. The business delivered double-digit growth in services contracts which now represent almost 70% of the total business, offset by declines in new instrument installation revenues. The ongoing strength in our contracted business speaks to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $417 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline.\nPathology was up mid-single digits globally and was more than offset by declines in the mid-20s in cell analysis due to the constrained capital environment for instrumentation. NASD declined low teens as expected, driven by more clinical products being produced this year versus Q2 of last year. Europe was a bright spot for DGG, growing low single digits in the quarter, while Americas and China declined. Despite the subdued market environment, we continue to innovate in our cell analysis business. We recently introduced the Agilent Spectrum flow cytometer, which allows our customers to perform sophisticated experiments that expand the range of the research on the same easy-to-use NovoCyte platform.\nBob will now provide details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and third quarter guidance. Q2 revenue was $1.573 billion. a decline of 7.4% core. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 0.8 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.2%, resulting in a reported decline of 8.4%. As Padraig mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 11%, with both biopharma and small molecule declining roughly the same percentage.\nInstrument demand continues to be constrained, while services delivered mid-single-digit growth. Looking forward, while we have seen sentiment improve, instrument purchases are still constrained and we are expecting that to continue for the rest of the year. In addition, we have reduced our expectations for NASD as several clinical programs have pushed out into next year and some commercial products have not ramped at the pace as expected. As a result, we have reduced our full year growth outlook for the pharma end market from roughly flat to down low double digits, similar to our Q2 performance.\nOur revised expectation for the pharma end market is the largest change in our outlook. The chemical and advanced materials market was better than expected, declining 3% after coming off a very tough comparison of 16% growth last year. The academia and government market declined 12% against a tough compare of 11% growth last year. While soft globally, the decline was driven by China, which was down mid-30s. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 2%. Our pathology business continues to show resilience in this market, growing mid-single digits, while our NGS QC instrumentation business also grew slightly. These were offset by softness in our NGS chemistries business.\nThe environmental and forensics market declined 2%. The business grew mid-single digits ex China, highlighted by continued strength in serving the rapidly expanding PFAS opportunity. The food market declined 13% on a very tough compare of 21% growth last year, heavily impacted by the low 30s decline in China. On a geographic basis, all regions declined. The Americas region was down 5%. Europe was down 3%, while Asia Pacific ex China was down slightly. China was down 21%, missing our expectations of a mid-teens decline. We saw demand weakness expand beyond pharma. As a result, we have revised our full year expectations for China for a mid-single-digit decline to a double-digit decline.\nWe have seen funnel activity increase because of the recently announced stimulus program, but we are not assuming any revenue impact in our fiscal year. Moving down to P&L. Our second quarter gross margin was 55.6%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.1% was down year-over-year as expected. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income and a lower tax rate. Our tax rate was 12.5%, and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding.\nPutting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.22, down 4% from a year ago, less than the decline in revenue and ahead of our expectations. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $333 million in the quarter and we invested $103 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. We returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter. $69 million through dividends and $230 million through repurchase shares, catching up on our anti-dilutive buying year-to-date.\nIn summary, we met our expectations for the quarter our markets are recovering but at a slower pace than we anticipated. We are directing our energy towards high-growth opportunities and are committed to delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. Now on to our revised outlook for the year and our third quarter guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.50 billion. This represents a decline of 6.0% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.4% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points.\nThis is a $300 million reduction at the midpoint and is primarily related to changes in 2 areas: China overall in the pharma end market outside of China. For China, we have reduced our expectations to a double-digit decline from mid-single digits with all end markets being reduced. This represents roughly $70 million of the guidance reduction. The remainder of the change in the pharma end market globally outside of China is due to 2 factors. The first and largest factor is continued caution in budget releases and extended approval times for instrumentation purchases in both small and large molecules. This is roughly $175 million of the change.\nThe second factor is related to NASD due to the reasons I mentioned earlier, and represents the remaining $55 million reduction. While down from our previous guidance, we are expecting growth in the second half of the year to be roughly 400 basis points better than the first half of the year and plan to exit the year roughly flat year-on-year at the midpoint of the new guidance.\nFull year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, representing a decline of 5.3% to 3.5%. This incorporates a roughly $35 million expense reduction due to the actions Padraig mentioned. The majority hit in Q4 in order to help mitigate the bottom line impact of the change to our revenue guidance. It also assumes a 13% tax rate and 292 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nWe will leverage our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the second half of the year in addition to our anti-dilutive repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be weighted towards Q3. All told, we expect to return roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this year between dividends and share repurchases. In addition, the Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will go into effect August 1 and replace the existing authorization.\nNow for our Q3 guidance, we expect revenue will be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents a decline of 8.2% to 5.8% on a reported basis and a decline of 6.9% to 4.5% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined were a headwind of 130 basis points. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a decline of 12.6% to 10.5%.\nLooking forward, we remain disciplined. We're focusing on what we can control and driving strong execution in a challenging market, and we are optimistic about the long-term future. Now back to Padraig.\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nWhen I joined you last quarter as CEO elect, I said Agilent has a compelling story to tell, and I was excited by the possibilities that lie before us as we help our customers bring great [indiscernible] to life. That excitement has only grown. I spent 26 years at Agilent, first starting as a field employee before moving to sales and then leading some of our businesses. I know Agilent's strengths and its opportunities very well. We are in great long-term growth markets. And while the markets are recovering slower than anticipated, they are recovering.\nThis company is a leader across key platforms, making us uniquely qualified to support our customers and their missions to solve some of the world's most important problems. And our customers value their relationships with us because we offer them an unparalleled experience. And as I said earlier, that is a competitive differentiator in the market. The actions we are now taking, while difficult, will enable us to quickly capitalize on growth opportunities as the markets fully recover. I know the future is bright, and we will forge an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and create value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I look forward to continued dialogue with all of you. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. .",

McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to first acknowledge our news last week that I will be retiring at the end of the fiscal year, and that Padraig McDonnell is Agile's new Chief Operating Officer and will become CEO on May 1. It was a difficult decision to retire after almost 40 great years with this special company and in the role that I love, I will miss working with the One Agilent team. However, I must say it's a great feeling and quite gratifying to be handing over the CEO reins to a tremendously capable successor in [ Padraig ]. With Agilent operating from a position of strength and with a very promising long-term outlook. I have known [ Padraig ] for more than 20 years. I've worked closely with him during that time. He has always been completely committed to our customers and Agilent's success. He is a product of our culture, knows our company, team and markets, and those have developed compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. [ Padraig ] has a strong track record result at every position he has held during his 26-year career at Agilent. I know he has the knowledge, leadership skills and customer focus that will be key to Agilent's success moving forward. I look forward to all of you seeing firsthand what a capable result driven leader we have in [ Padraig ]. [ Padraig ] would you like to say a few words?\n\nPadraig McDonnell\n\nSenior VP, Chief Commercial Officer of Agilent & President of Agilent CrossLab Group\n\nThank you, Mike. I'm honored to be able to follow you as Agilent's next CEO, and I'm grateful for your support throughout my career and during this transition. You have made a significant impact on Agilent, our customers and our team. I'd also like to welcome Angelica Riemann to this call. After leading our services division for the last 2.5 years, I can tell you she has the experience and the skill set to continue evolving ACG to align with the growing opportunities that the business has demonstrated in supporting the broad installed base and our enterprise customers. Expect to see continued great things ahead from Angelica and ACG.\nI've had the pleasure of meeting some of you on this call, and I look forward to meeting and working with you all in the future. Agilent has a compelling story to tell, and I'm excited by the possibilities that lie in front of us as we help our customers bring great signs to life.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, [ Padraig ]. For today's call, I will take [ lead ] covering the overview of our financial results, while next quarter, [ Padraig ] will take on these duties as the new CEO.\nNow on to the Q1 results. We are pleased with the start of the year. The Agilent team continues its strong execution in a challenging market environment. The first quarter provided further evidence of our team's capabilities with revenue coming in better than expected at $1.66 billion. This represents a decline of 6.4% against a tough compare of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. The better-than-expected top line results and disciplined cost management drove higher-than-expected earnings per share of $1.29 down 6% from Q1 last year. Given the solid Q1 results and our continued view is slow but steady recovery throughout the year, we are maintaining our full year outlook that we shared with you in November.\nKey to our Q1 performance was the ongoing sequential stabilization we experienced in China and secular growth drivers in applied markets globally. From an end market perspective, our total pharma business is down 12% which was in line with our expectations. This falls 11% increase in the first quarter last year. While declining overall against a very strong Q1 of last year, our applied end markets were more resilient than expected and show sequential growth from the fourth quarter. In these markets, PFAS Solutions and Advanced Materials, including batteries and semiconductors were [ high bits ] for us. Geographically, both China and Europe finished Q1 better than expected, while revenue for the Americas was in line with expectations.\nLooking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $846 million and down 11%. This is against a difficult compare of 10% growth last year. While still too early to call an overall market recovery, results were better than expected. Our diversified portfolio and broad end market coverage helped drive the performance. We continue to experience a conservative environment for capital spending. But are better than expected, Q1 results were driven by consumables, which grew mid-single digits, China and a better-than-expected performance in applied markets.\nDuring the quarter, we also completed the expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing facility as we continue to take steps to ensure our long-term leadership in China. We also made our first customer shipments for Agilent's newly released LC/MS offerings. Our latest highest sensitivity triple quad, the [ 6495d ] enables expanded and enhanced workflows, including for PFAS. This, in addition to Revident, the first of a new generation of LC/Q-TOF systems that combine a new architecture with enhanced instrument intelligence for maximize operation time and productivity.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $405 million. This is up 5% with growth across all regions except China. Our contracts business led the way with double-digit growth overall, led by strength in enterprise service contracts. This performance highlights the continued strength and resiliency of our business. Connect rates for both services and consumables continue to improve. This is a result of our focused strategy to deliver end-to-end customer value while also building a larger recurring revenue business.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $407 million, down 6% core. Our pathology-related businesses and our NGS QC portfolio grew mid-single digits which was more than offset by declines in NGS chemistries and NASD. NASD declined low double digits as expected. This is because a very tough compare of 22% growth driven by significant volume last year from a single commercial program. We continue to be encouraged with our long-term prospects due to the increasing programs across a range of indications many of them target large patient populations. The DGG team continues to innovate and deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. In the quarter, we induced a new [ Proteo ] analyzer system. The new platform simplifies and improves the efficiency of analyzing complex protein mixtures. We [ process ] [indiscernible] to enter the workflows across the pharma, biotech, food analysis and academia sectors.\nFrom an overall Agilent perspective, we recently achieved world economic forum recognition for operations of Vauban, Germany. This site was named a Global Lighthouse for implementing innovation that boost productivity, output and quality. This marks the second Global Lighthouse award for us after seeing the recognition for our Singapore facility two years ago. Agilent is the only life science tools company to be recognized as a global lighthouse. Agilent recently achieved a top 5 ranking in the [indiscernible] list of 100 most sustainable companies. In addition, we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index globally and in North America for the ninth year in a row.\nLooking ahead, we expect the current market environment to persist through the first half, we expect a slow and steady improvement in the second half of the year. We will continue taking actions that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. We will maintain our approach to prioritize investing for growth with a focus on execution and driving productivity. Our better-than-expected Q1 results and my confidence the Agilent team reinforced our view for the full year. Tom will now provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob's comments, I will be joined for some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter. as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our second quarter guidance.\nQ1 revenue was $1.66 billion, a decline of 6.4% core. On a reported basis, currency added 0.9 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.1%, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. And overall, orders were greater than revenue in Q1 as expected. As Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market declined 12%. Within pharma, biopharma declined low single digits but grew low single digits outside China, bolstered by strength in services and consumables. Small molecule was down high teens in the quarter with softness globally.\nThe Chemical and Advanced Materials market was down 4% off a very tough comparison of 14% growth last year. We saw broad resilience in Advanced Materials with a low single-digit increase year-on-year as well as growth sequentially. Given the extremely tough compare of high 20s growth last year, these are impressive results. As expected, the chemical side saw a decline.\nThe Academia and Government market was up 2%. The growth in this market reflects the stability of academic funding and lab activity.\nOur business in the Diagnostics and Clinical market declined 5%, mid-single-digit growth in Pathology was more than offset by continued headwinds in genomics, cell analysis and LC and LC/MS. The environmental and forensics market declined 1% after growing 12% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see new regulations around the world driving PFAS testing. Europe grew mid-single digits, while China and the Americas were down low single digits. Americas faced a difficult compare of low 30s growth last year.\nThe Food market declined 3% but was up low single digits, excluding China. On a geographic basis, as Mike mentioned, both China and Europe exceeded our expectations while the Americas were in line with our expectations. China was down 9% and showed a sequential increase over last quarter, which was much better than expectations. China benefited from continued stabilization and a bigger-than-expected Lunar New Year impact as some customers pulled forward incremental demand from Q2. We estimate the pull-forward impact to be roughly $15 million or 5% of China's revenue in the quarter. Even adjusting for this impact, China outperformed.\nEurope was down 4% year-on-year after growing 10% last year and was up mid-single digits sequentially. This was driven by continued strong demand for our ACG services, offset by muted demand in pharma and expected softness in chemicals. In the Americas, revenue was down 8% due to declines in pharma and the softness in NASD and NGS chemistries.\nMoving down the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.0% down 50 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.8% was down year-over-year as expected. Our ongoing cost savings initiatives are delivering as planned. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income in the quarter, driven by nice work from our treasury team, coupled with very strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.5% and we had 294 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.29, down 6% from a year ago and ahead of our expectations.\nNow let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be very pleased with our cash flow generation. Operating cash flow was $485 million in the quarter, significantly above last year. In Q1, we invested $90 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. And during the quarter, we returned $69 million to shareholders through dividends. Although no shares were repurchased during the quarter, we expect to catch up on our anti-dilutive share repurchasing for the remainder of the year. In Q2, we expect a minimum of $180 million to be repurchased. All in all, we had a good start to the year. And as Mike mentioned, it reinforces our confidence in the full year guide we provided in November.\nNow to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. This represents a decline of 9.1% to 7.4% on a reported basis and a decline of 8.4% to 6.7% on a core basis against 9% growth last year. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 70 basis points. Our Q2 guidance also reflects the $15 million impact of the Q1 pull forward in China I mentioned earlier. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.17 and $1.20.\nBefore turning back over to Mike, I just want to express my thanks to Mike and to congratulate [ Padraig ]. Mike, it has been a real pleasure to work with you. While there have been many ups and downs in the markets these past few years, one thing I knew I could always count on is your steady leadership and strong partnership. And [ Padraig ], congratulations again. I'm really looking forward to working with you. And now I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Today marks my 37th and final earnings call with all of you. Time does truly fly by. I want to first thank you for your support and engagement over the years. I have to say it has been a tremendous honor serving as Agilent's CEO and represent the achievements of the One Agilent team to all of you and the broader investor community. In 2015, we launched the then new Agilent with a goal to transform Agilent into a leading life science and diagnostics company. We had ambitious goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation with significantly stepped up financial results delivered by an unmatched One Agilent team working together in a truly differentiated and compelling company culture. I couldn't be proud of the Agilent team and what we've accomplished together over the last 9 years. While current market conditions remain challenging, the long-term promise of growth remains with end markets power buying investments to improve the human condition.\nOn the Agilent front, we've never been in a stronger position to continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve our customers within the market and deliver differentiated financial results. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. I will miss it. while at the same time, I know that you will enjoy working with [ Padraig ] in the years ahead. Like me, I know you'll be impressed with [ Padraig's ] knowledge of our industry and our business. As I noted earlier, he knows how to develop compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. His track record of success during his Agilent leadership journey speaks for itself and have no doubt, it will continue in his new role. While this is my last earnings call with you, I'm certain that the best is yet to come for Agilent. Thank you, and now over to you, Parmeet for the Q&A.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.",

My name is Bo and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bo, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our fourth quarter financial results investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com.\nToday's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before we get into discussing our results and outlook, I want to mention that we're joined today by Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, and Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. We're also joining this call for the first time by Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group, Phil's name may be new to some of you, but he's well known at Agilent and in the industry. Phil has been with us for more than 13 years, coming over with the Varian acquisition and overseeing our market-leading spectroscopy business. We're extremely pleased to have some of the Phil's knowledge, experience and proven leadership strength heading up our LSAG business. In a short time in the row, we've already seen Phil at tremendous value as a member of our senior leadership team, welcome, Phil.\nNow on to our fourth quarter results. The Agilent team once again continued to perform well under challenging market conditions. Revenue of $1.69 billion declined 9.7% core after increasing 17.5% last year. This is at the high end of our guidance. Our proactive approach to manage our cost structure in this market environment helped us deliver healthy fourth quarter operating margins of 27.8%. Q4 earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance. While this was a decline of 10%, it comes against a tough compare last year when EPS grew 26%. While the market continues to be challenging, we believe we're starting to see signs of stabilization. As an encouraging data point for the quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 1 for the company and greater than 1 for our LSAG instruments. Let's now take a close look at our Q4 performance, starting with our regional results.\nDuring the quarter, while down year-on-year, we delivered sequential growth, except for China as expected. In China, our business declined 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 last year. While China was down sequentially, these results are very much in line with our expectations. And the year-on-year monthly performance improved slightly as the quarter progressed. In addition, orders were slightly higher than revenue for the quarter. While it is too early to call these 2 data points at trend, we see this as occurring a sign of potential stabilization. In late September, I traveled to China the first time since the COVID outbreak to meet with the Agilent team, key customers and government officials. I was reminded of both the sheer size of the Chinese economy and our market there. I saw firsthand the work being done to bolster economic activity in the near term and create an environment that will support continued growth into the future. I remain convinced China will continue to play an important role in life sciences, and I'm confident that the China market will return to growth. In looking at our largest end market, pharma declined 14%, driven by continued caution among customers on capital expenditures for new instruments. Within pharma, biopharma form better than small molecule, Geographically, our biopharma business outside China grew high single digits.\nLooking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group delivered revenue of $928 million, down 18% core versus a tough compare last year above 22%. Customers continue to hold off on capital expenditures, particularly in the Pharma segment of LSAG's business, which declined in the high 20% range. This is against growth in the low 20s last year. On the other hand, we continue to see strong customer demand and growth in our PFAS solutions as well as continued strength in the Advanced Materials segment. These are 2 secular trends [indiscernible] higher than before and we remain optimistic about future growth in these market segments. While the market environment remains challenged, we continue to innovate and provide unique solutions for our customers. The new products we've launched in June at ASMS, in particular, the 6595 LC Triple Quad, which is focused on key applications like PFAS, continue to generate positive customer interest and new orders.\nWe're also bringing innovative new solutions for customers across the biopharma value chain. We [ also ] saw a number of our online UHPLC systems with large biopharma companies. The systems are easy to use, reliable and deliver significant value by providing fully automated analysis of critical quality attributes allowing real-time decision-making outside the lab. The Agilent [indiscernible] side group posted revenue of $404 million, up 4% core and 6% on a reported basis. ACG delivered growth across all end markets and in all regions except China. The Contract Services business was up double digits, offset by the services associated with new instrument placements. Our strategy of increasing connect rate continues to pay off. In the quarter, the contract services business represented 65% of ACG revenue, a number that has grown nicely over the years. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $356 million flat on a core basis and up 1% reported.\nDGG's results led by the pathology NASD businesses, which both delivered low double-digit growth. These strong results were offset by the continued market challenge in genomics both consumables and instruments. Our NASD portfolio and capacity expansion are continue as planned. We're confident in the long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Before I finish covering DGG I want to thank Sam Raha for his contributions over the years have helped us to build a strong foundation for the DGG business. I wish Sam well.\nIn addition to these business group highlights, during the quarter, we will recognize for our commitment to sustainability. Agilent's near long-term targets for reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the highly regarded client-based targets initiative. A year ago, we entered 2023 sharing a view of economic and industry uncertainty as we got it from moderating growth in the second half of 2023. We had not anticipated however, the significance of the market headwinds the industry eventually face particularly in the pharma market and China. Despite the challenging market conditions, we delivered full year revenue of $6.83 billion growing 1.5% core. While our full year growth was lower than initially expected, we met or exceeded every quarterly guidance range we provided, a solid testament to the team's execution ability, including FY '23 results, our 4-year compound annual growth rate is 7%. This is at the high end of our long-term growth guidance. In FY '23, we delivered operating margins of 27.4%. This is up 30 basis points this year and up more than 400 basis points in the last 4 years. Earnings per share of $5.44 were up 4%, delivering leverage earnings growth for the year. Our 4-year compound annual growth rate for EPS is 15%.\nLooking back, 2023 was a challenging year. What I'm particularly proud of is the Agilent team's ability to quickly pivot and take action to adjust these challenges while staying relentlessly focused on our customers. While we work to significantly reduce expenses, Agilent's customer satisfaction ratings remain at all-time highs. At the same time, our employee engagement continues to be excellent, as we achieved a number of best employer awards over the last year. All this helped us deliver another year of leverage earnings in an extremely difficult market environment.\nBefore turning it over to Bob for more detail, I want to provide some high-level perspective on FY '24 and beyond. For 2024, we anticipate a slow but steady recovery throughout the year. In our initial outlook at the high of our guidance, we expect revenue to return to growth. At the same time, our range for EPS in the year ahead has us again delivering leveraged EPS growth. As we look ahead, we remain convinced that market challenges being faced by the industry today are transient. Our end markets are powered by investments in improving the human condition. The pace of science, innovation and discovery continues to increase, which will fuel further growth. We remain focused on winning in the marketplace, our differentiated products, services and most importantly, our One Agilent team are all essential to the success of our customers. We are well positioned for long-term growth.\nBob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year. along with more specifics on our initial view for fiscal 2024 and Q1. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter with core growth at the top end of guidance and EPS exceeding our expectations as we executed well against challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nQ4 revenue was $1.69 billion, down 9.7% core and 8.7% on a reported basis. This is after growing 17.5% in Q4 of last year when we benefited from the recovery from the Shanghai shutdown in Q2 of last year. This created an estimated 1 point of headwind in the year-on-year results this quarter. As expected, we saw weakness in capital purchases in LSAG with the biggest impact in our China business.\nNow I'd like to share additional detail on our end markets for the quarter. Revenue in our largest market, pharma declined 14% versus 20% growth in Q4 of last year. Biopharma declined 2%, while small molecule was down 23%. However, Biopharma ex China was up 7% in the quarter and grew solidly for the year. And while small molecule was down, the decline was most pronounced in China. On outside China, small molecule was up sequentially in the quarter. Chemicals and Advanced Materials declined 11% versus growth of 27% last year, while flat sequentially. Our Chemicals and Energy subsegments were down 15%, while Advanced Materials were down roughly 2% globally and up 4% in the Americas and Europe combined. The food market was down low double digits against a tough 20% growth comparison last year. High single-digit growth in the Americas was offset by declines in all other regions.\nIn the Americas, PFAS testing is emerging as an important growth area in food testing, helping drive the high single-digit growth. We expect testing for PFAS chemicals will continue to be a growth driver across multiple end markets over time. The environmental and forensics market declined 3% versus 18% growth last year. Similar to the food market, the Americas region continues to experience strong growth, up double digits driven by PFAS. This strong performance was primarily offset by softness in China, which was down year-on-year but up slightly on a sequential basis. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 4%. While we delivered low double-digit growth at our pathology-related businesses, it was more than offset by continued weakness in genomics.\nThe academia and government market was down low single digits with strength in the Americas, driven by government funding, offset by weakness in China and Europe. Results were pressured across all geographies in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, China was down 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 of last year, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The rest of Asia was down mid-single digits in both Americas and Europe declined low single digits in the quarter. Before turning to the rest of the P&L, I'd like to quickly summarize some\nfull year highlights by end market and geography. From an end market perspective, all markets grew low to mid-single digits for the year, except for pharma, which was down 2% globally. And in addition, all geographies grew except China, which was down 5%. Now back to the P&L for the quarter. Despite the revenue declines, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.8% and our operating margin was a healthy 27.8% in Q4, which was slightly better than our internal expectations. Below the line, we benefited from stronger-than-expected cash flow generating incremental interest income in the quarter. Our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected.\nPutting it all together, earnings per share were $1.38 for the quarter, exceeding our expectations, albeit down 10% from a year ago when EPS grew 26%. As Mike mentioned, our Q4 results capped a year where we grew 1.5% or on the top line, increased operating margins by 30 basis points and grew EPS by 4% while overcoming a couple of points of currency headwinds. This is a real statement on the team's ability to quickly adapt to market changes while still delivering leveraged earnings growth.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet. I'm incredibly proud of the Agilent team as Q4 continued the strength of very strong quarterly cash flow results. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $516 million, well over 100% of adjusted net income and invested $84 million in capital expenditures. CapEx spending is driven by our ongoing NASD capacity expansion, which remains on track. For the year, we delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 44% over last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.6x.\nWith the current challenges in the market, it is great to be a company with a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow. In the quarter, we paid out $66 million in dividends and spent $80 million to repurchase shares. And for the year, we returned $840 million to shareholders through $265 million in dividends and $575 million in share repurchases. Looking forward, you may have also seen that we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, providing another source of value to our shareholders. It's worth noting that we've increased our dividend every year since we first began issuing them in 2012.\nNow let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. As Mike stated, we expect to see a slow but steady recovery throughout fiscal 2024. However, we also acknowledge the continued market uncertainty, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and depressed capital spending. Like several of our peers, we expect the markets to be down slightly for the year, while we expect to perform better. Given the expected slower market conditions, we've taken additional steps to adjust our cost structure. Incorporated into our guidance is roughly $175 million of cost savings. Given the significance, I want to provide a little more detail on these actions.\nRoughly 30% of the savings or related to portfolio optimization decisions we've taken in DGG, the [ loss ] of which was the exit of the Resolution Biosciences business. Another 25% is related to material and logistics cost savings as well as optimizing our real estate footprint with the remaining savings tied to continued reductions in discretionary spend and optimizing our workforce. Along with these actions, we've taken a $46 million charge for restructuring and other related costs in our Q4 GAAP results. These reductions, while difficult, are necessary to ensure we continue to fund our most critical investments as well as fund the variable compensation resets from this year. These actions help ensure the company delivers leveraged earnings growth in FY '24 and will enable us to emerge even stronger when our markets inevitably return to their long-term growth rates.\nAs Mike noted earlier, we exited Q4 with some potential signs of stabilization with a book-to-bill ratio of 1 for the company and greater than 1 for LSAG instruments. While this is positive, we're going to be prudent in our initial guidance. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.71 billion to $6.81 billion. This represents a core growth range from a slight decline of 0.5% at the low end to 1 point of growth at the high end. Currency is a headwind of 1.2 points, while M&A is also a slight headwind of 10 basis points related to Resolution Bioscience. On a reported basis, we are expecting a decline in the range of 1.8% to 0.3% year-on-year. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. And while we expect to see recovery during the year in China, our initial view is it will still decline for the full year.\nFrom a business group perspective, we expect growth in both DGG and ACG while LSAG instruments will still be pressured. And in terms of phasing, we expect the first half of FY '24 to look similar to the second half of FY '23 with growth in the second half of next year. We are projecting modest operating margin expansion for the year. And below the line, we expect interest income and expense to offset each other, a tax rate of 13.5% and 293 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.44 to $5.55. This range represents flat to 2% growth versus FY '23. From a cash flow perspective, we expect another robust year. We are expecting roughly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow at $400 million in CapEx as spending increases on NASD's trained C&D expansions.\nLooking to Q1 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.605 billion. This represents a core decline of 11.3% to 8.5%, with currency and M&A having a minimal impact. At the midpoint, we are expecting growth that resembles what we just delivered in Q4 and assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This is against another difficult comp of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.23 as the cost savings fully ramped through the quarter. As Mike indicated, while we are expecting low growth in 2024, we remain optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term growth prospects. Our business remains very profitable and healthy and I know we will come out stronger as a company when market growth returns.\nAnd now I will turn the floor back over to Parmet for your questions. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Bob. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

My name is Bo and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja. Parmeet, please go ahead.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bo, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraik McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.\nThis presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com.\nToday's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis.\nCore revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates.\nDuring this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In today's call, I'll walk you through our Q3 results, share what we're now seeing in the market and provide context for our revised full year outlook. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments.\nThe Agilent team continues to execute well as we navigate our way through ongoing challenges of the current market environment. Our Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion at the top end of our expectations. This is a decline of 2% on a core basis against a tough compare of 13% in Q3 of last year. We continue to be proactive and are taking steps to help us deliver on our leveraged earnings model.\nOperating margins are 29.3%, up 180 basis points. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.43 are up 7% and above our expectations. The major drive behind our Q3 year-on-year decline in revenue is our China business. Excluding China, the rest of Agilent grew 2%, which was better than expected.\nWe knew we're up against a difficult compare in China and had previously guided for lower China revenues in Q3. However, the economy in China continued to weaken during the quarter, translated into a more challenging market environment than we had anticipated. With the softer market conditions in China and continued global macroeconomic challenges, we have lower growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe now expect core growth for the full year to be around 1%, down from our previous guide. Based on what we're seeing at this time, we're not assuming any improvement in the China market for the remainder of the year. We, however, view the near-term challenges we're experiencing as transitory and remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of our end markets.\nWe're turning now to our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on our 2 largest end markets. Our total pharma business is down 8%, driven by the pharma market in China being down 30%. Within pharma, our biopharma business grew 5%, while small molecule was down 16%.\nThe Chemical Advanced Materials market declined 3% versus a 22% increase last year. While we did see the chemical energy space being weighed down by macro concerns, slowing growth in Advanced Materials was more a function of a difficult compare as the volumes have remained steady and robust.\nLooking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets have delivered revenues of $927 million. This was a decline of 9% of a very tough compare of 18% growth. Last year's growth was helped by the benefit of recovery from the Q2 2022 Shanghai shutdown.\nLSAG's performance continues to be affected by the market environment in China across all end markets and pharma globally. Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases. We expect this market environment for new instrument purchases to continue for the rest of the year.\nAt this time, we are not assuming any benefit from a year-end budget flush or incremental stimulus in China. As we said before, we are continuing to prioritize invest in innovation. As an example, in June, Agilent's investment innovation were on full display at the Annual ASMS Conference.\nThe LSAG team introduced new products and comprehensive workflows to enhance data quality and productivity for our customers. These include 2 new LC/MS systems, a new PFAS workflow solution and an AI software for data analysis, among others.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $396 million. This is up an impressive 11% core with growth in all regions and end markets, as customers continue to embrace our value proposition. We continue to see strong demand for our services as we help customers drive productivity in the lab.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $349 million, up 3% core. Pathology grew high single digits as demand for our diagnostic test continues to grow. Our NASD business grew high teens. This growth was partially offset as we are continuing to see market weakness for our Genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses.\nRegarding resolution Bioscience, the market for kidded NGS-based companion diagnostics has not developed as we expected. Furthermore, we don't see a realistic path to profitability. As a result, we've made a difficult decision to shut down the business. However, our investments in future growth continue. For example, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter when our NASD business generated the first revenues from our Train B investment in Frederick, Colorado.\nNow looking forward for the company, as we navigate this challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in the Agilent team and our ability to continue driving leverage earnings growth, use our agile Agilent framework. We faced challenges before, and we're taking actions now that will make us stronger and position us well for the future.\nAs we stated last quarter, we are doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity. The goal is to generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth.\nWe are on track to achieve the cost savings we've targeted for the second half of this year. We are in attractive markets that will produce long-term growth. Our innovation engine remains strong and the battle test at One Agilent team is driving outstanding execution.\nBob and I will provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the full year and our fourth quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nQ3 revenue was $1.67 billion, a decline of 2.3% core and down 2.7% on a reported basis. This compares with 13.2% core growth last year. Currency was a 0.5 point headwind while M&A contribution was minimal. As you may recall, Q3 of last year benefited from roughly $35 million in revenue deferred from the second quarter as we ramp back up from the Shanghai shutdown in China. Accounting for this, our Q3 core growth would be roughly flat versus a year ago.\nAs Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 8%. This is in line with our reduced expectations coming out of Q2 with underperformance in China, offset by better performance in the rest of the world. The Chemicals and Advanced Materials market was down 3% off a very tough 22% compare, but dollar-wise was flat sequentially.\nThe academia and government market was up 5% and with all regions showing growth except the Americas, which was flat. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in pathology, partially offset by genomics weakness.\nThe environmental and forensics business grew 2%, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. The growth was generated by the build-out of water infrastructure projects and an expansion of funding for PFAS-related activities.\nThe food market grew 1% based on strength in Asia outside of China and mid-single-digit growth in Europe, driven by new food testing regulations.\nOn a geographic basis, while China underperformed, the Americas and the rest of Asia were better than expected, while Europe was in line with our expectations.\nMoving down the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.3%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Like last quarter, this was largely due to the product and services mix, and pricing was slightly better than our expectations. Below gross margin, the expense reduction actions we initiated in the second quarter helped strengthen operating margins. We also benefited from a reduction in variable pay expenses.\nAs Mike mentioned, margins were 29.3%, up 180 basis points from last year. Below the line, our interest income was higher than planned, while our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 295 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.43, up 7% from a year ago, a very good result given declining revenue.\nNow let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be pleased with our cash flow generation this year. Cash flow from operations was $562 million in the quarter, and is $1.3 billion year-to-date. In Q3, we invested $81 million in capital expenditures, totaling $214 million year-to-date, effectively flat year-on-year as we continue to optimize our CapEx spending.\nGiven the strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our free cash flow forecast for the year to $1.2 billion, comprised of operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $300 million. This is an increase of $250 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance.\nDespite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, our balanced capital allocation strategy is intact. During the quarter, we returned $401 million to shareholders. $66 million through dividends and repurchase shares worth $335 million. This ongoing balanced approach to capital deployment is another example of the confidence we have in our team and our belief in the long-term strength of our markets.\nBefore getting into the revised full year outlook, I want to mention we have taken a $291 million pretax charge in Q3 associated with the decision to shut down the Resolution Bioscience business. This charge, which is excluded from non-GAAP results, includes an impairment write-down along with charges associated with the wind-down and exit of the business. We expect the wind down to continue through Q4 and into early FY '24.\nNow to the revised outlook for the year in Q4. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment we are seeing, particularly in China, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.80 billion to $6.85 billion. This represents a decline of 0.7% to flat on a reported basis and core growth of 0.8% to 1.5%. This is a core growth reduction of 260 basis points from the midpoint of our last guide.\nRoughly 85% of the change is related to reduced expectations in China while the remainder is due to some incremental cautiousness from our customers on CapEx spend as well as softness in genomics and the shutdown of Resolution Bioscience. As Mike said earlier, we are not assuming any incremental stimulus in China or any material year-end budget flush in these revised projections.\nGiven the large change in China, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on how we are forecasting the rest of the year, recognizing that the market continues to be very dynamic. To provide some context, in Q3 through June, our business in China was tracking to a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, which was in line with our expectations. However, in July, we saw a further deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter.\nAnd while the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in the other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4. In addition, we are facing our most difficult quarterly compare in China, where we grew 44% in Q4 of last year. We are now expecting Q4 to decline in the mid-30s year-on-year.\nFor the full year, we are expecting China to decline mid-single digits versus growing mid-single digits. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.43, representing leveraged earnings growth of 3% to 4% and roughly 6% to 7% growth net of currency.\nThe change in full year guide results in Q4 revenue being in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion. This represents a decline of 8% to 10.5% on a reported basis and a decline of 9.5% to 12% on a core basis. The recovery last year in Q4 of the remaining revenue deferred from the Shanghai Q2 shutdown negatively impacts the year-on-year results by roughly 1 point.\nIn fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36.\nThanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Mike for some closing comments before taking your questions. Mike?\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. While today's macro environment is challenged for new instrument purchases, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our end markets, the diversification of our business and in our proven ability to grow faster than the market. I'd like to share a few examples why my confidence remains intact despite near-term challenges.\nIn Pharma, our largest end market, innovation and advance of medicines continue with new therapeutics flowing into the market. The demographic drivers of this market are on our side, a growing global population that expects access to health care and extending life expectancy to be key priorities from their governments. Our market-leading solutions are critical to innovation behind new therapeutics and ensuring the safety and quality of on-market drugs.\nIn the applied markets, growing PFAS testing and the electrical vehicle transition are here to stay, action in new opportunities for growth. Everyone wants to have a safer water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe and the search for and production of more sustainable materials and energy sources remains a global priority. Agilent is a diversified leader in a unique position to help our customers drive their solutions. We remain a trusted partner, our customers though they can rely on in both good and challenging times. Our combination of leading instrumentation and world-class customer support is a long-term competitive advantage.\nAt the heart of this long-term competitive advantage is the Agilent team and the One Agilent culture. You see this reflected in a recent recognition on Glassdoor and in being named A Great Place to Work in all 27 countries and territories around the world where we qualify for certification.\nWe have a company mission focused on advancing the quality of life. To learn more about this, I would encourage you to review the latest addition of the ESG report that we issued last month. We have proactively managed the company through the short term, always with an eye towards our customers and in the long term.\nWe have been proactive in managing our business to drive leveraged earnings but not at the expense of customer satisfaction and future growth. Yes, these are challenging times, but we have the team, the strategy and the right culture that would deliver long-term success.\nThank you for joining us today. And now over to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Bill, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

My name is Sarah, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sarah, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with the recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com.\nToday's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Our guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates.\nDuring this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In our call, I'd like to first cover our second quarter results. I'll then provide some insight into the recent market dynamics that we are seeing and how this has translated into lower expectations for the second half of this year. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. An increasingly challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered very solid results in the second quarter. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 9.5% core above our expectations with growth across all end markets and regions. Our results are driven by an innovative and broad portfolio, a differentiated customer experience and outstanding execution by the Agilent team.\nOperating margin equated at 25.6%, up 30 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.27 are up 12%. Highlights from an end market perspective include our 2 largest markets, Pharma and Chemicals and Advanced Materials performing very well in the quarter. Our pharma business grew 6% on top of 13% growth last year. Pharma was led by biopharma, which grew 16% driven by lab services, consumables and our NASD business, while small molecule declined 1%. In previous calls, we talked about the small molecule replacement cycle and that the exceptional double-digit growth rates we've seen in the past 2 years would eventually moderate, which is what we started to see this quarter.\nOur Chemicals and Advanced Materials business delivered strong results once again growing 16%. The Advanced Materials side grew more than 20% and the Chemical & Energy segment grew double digits. On a geographic basis, 32% growth in China exceeded our high expectations. While the compare was an easier one, even adjusting for the COVID lockdowns in Shanghai a year ago, we still achieved double-digit growth in China. In addition, Europe delivered 5% core growth, while Americas grew 3%, albeit against a tough compare of 13% a year ago.\nLooking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences applied markets group delivered revenues of $968 million, up 10% core. Our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. Our LC and LC/MS products continue to lead the way with 16% growth in the quarter with strength across all end markets. Continued demand for lab consumables led to 13% growth in that business as well. During the quarter, we added additional strength to our LCMS product line by acquiring e-MSion and their innovative electronic capture technology. e-MSion technology allows researchers to develop biotherapy products more quickly for treating disease. Agilent's LSAG team continue to bring several innovative new products to market, including enhancements to our Bravo NGS automation, Karube Viz and the cell analysis NovoCyte systems. Many of these enhancements are specifically focused on serving our customers in the biopharma market.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $387 million. This is up 13% core driven by strong revenues from service contracts. ACG's growth was broad-based, represent ongoing resilient demand for our services. We continue to see many opportunities for future growth given our services portfolio. In particular, the benefits of our service offerings has to help customers drive productivity and lab are even more relevant in today's challenging environment. Our strong and trusted customer support has also helped us to drive share gains and acquire new enterprise customers.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics we've delivered revenues of $362 million, up 3% core. Strength in our pathology and NASD businesses drove growth, partially offset by general industry-wide weakness in genomics. NASD posted another strong quarter growing in the high 20s. Our train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online later this quarter, while construction has already started on the next phase of expansion.\nOverall, we wrapped up Agilent's first half of fiscal 2023 with double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. However, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with stresses in the banking system have accelerated a more conservative approach from our customers across the globe. This has primarily affected CapEx-related instrument spending across most end markets but are centered mainly in the pharma markets in the U.S. and China. Early-stage biotech customers, while a small part of our revenues, dramatically scaled back purchases as funding and liquidity challenges drove cash conservation.\nOutside of these early-stage biotechs, the work funnel continues to be healthy, but it has taken a longer time for order to be approved, slowing deal velocity and generate some new orders. We expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year. Because of these factors, we are taking a more cautious approach to the second half and have revised our forecast downward. As a result, we now expect core revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%, with EPS growing faster than revenue at 7% to 8%. Our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we're doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leverage earnings growth in the second half.\nAs we've done in the past, we will generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We have an unstoppable Agilent team that is battle-tested. They consistently execute at extremely high level and are well prepared to deal with any challenges they may face. Bob will provide the details on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. But overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus, customer service and unmatched execution of the Agilent team remain the key to our continued success. After Bob delivers his comments, I'll be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the year and our third quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q2 revenue was $1.72 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 9.5% core and up 6.8% on a reported basis. Currency was a 2.8 point headwind, while the M&A contribution was minor as affected. In Q2, we continued to leverage our backlog and exited the quarter with our backlog at a normalized level. As Mike mentioned, our 2 largest end markets performed well in the quarter. Pharma, our largest end market, posted 6% growth led by biopharma, while small molecule declined slightly. Chemicals and Advanced Materials continued to drive strong secular growth of 16% during the quarter on top of 9% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well, with the advanced materials market continuing to lead the way.\nAs in past quarters, semiconductors and batteries are driving demand in this space. And looking at the rest of the end markets, the food market grew an impressive 21% during the quarter driven by very strong growth in China. We also saw strong results in the Americas and in Europe. The academia and government market was up 11%, led by China and Europe, as the funding environment continues to be constructive. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% on top of 5% growth last year. Pathology again led the way for us here, partially offset by genomics. And the environmental and forensics business grew 2%, led by China and the Americas, while Europe declined. The Americas slowed after a very strong Q1, but still delivered mid-single-digit growth.\nOn a geographic basis, the China team exceeded our expectations, delivering 32% growth following last year's COVID lockdowns in Shanghai. As we mentioned last year, the COVID-related lockdowns deferred roughly $55 million in Q2 from last year into third and fourth quarters. So while Q2 is an easier compare, we have much tougher compares in China going forward. Taking out the effects of the lockdown this quarter, we estimate China still grew double digits, so very solid results by our China team. And the rest of Asia grew high single digits, better than expected.\nThe Americas grew 3% with growth across all end markets. From a group perspective, both ACG and DGG grew, while LSAG unexpectedly declined low single digits as we started to see the accelerated effects of the slowing CapEx environment. Europe grew 5%, in line with expectations led by pharma and CAM.\nNow moving down the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, largely due to an unfavorable product mix. The benefit of pricing was as expected. Below gross margin, we had good cost discipline in SG&A, which drove our operating margin to 25.6%, up 30 basis points from last year. Below the line, we benefited from higher-than-planned interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected.\nNow putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.27, up 12% from a year ago, a very good result, combined with our 9.5% core top line growth. During the quarter, operating cash flow was very strong, generating $398 million. This result was helped in part by deferring estimated U.S. tax payments of roughly $60 million to our fiscal fourth quarter. This is due to the payment deferral relief made available by the IRS to taxpayers in designated counties affected by the winter storms in California. We returned $151 million to shareholders, $66 million through dividends and repurchased shares worth $85 million, while also investing $57 million in CapEx, continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment.\nOur strong balance sheet is even more of an asset in this market environment and remains very healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. And earlier this month, Moody's upgraded Agilent's investment-grade rating on our corporate long-term debt to Baa1. This action is an important recognition of Agilent's financial strength.\nNow on to the revised outlook for the year and guidance for Q3. For the year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion. This represents reported growth of 1.2% to 2.7% and core growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 1.9 points while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth. In addition to revising our guidance, we've increased the guidance range for the second half of the year to reflect a wider range of possible outcomes.\nFor modeling purposes, I would encourage you to use the midpoint of our guide. Our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. The outlook for our recurring revenue businesses remains largely unchanged. From an end market perspective, the market most impacted is pharma where we are now expecting full year growth of low single digits, down from high single digits. And from a geographic perspective, we see impacts focused in the U.S. and China. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.65, representing growth of 7% to 8%. And as with revenue, I encourage you to model at the midpoint of our guidance.\nNow turning to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents a decline of 4.5% to a decline of 2.5% for both reported and core revenue. This is on top of a tough compare of 13% growth last year. Adjusting for the China deferral in Q3 of last year would add roughly 200 basis points to both reported and core growth in the quarter. Currency and M&A impact in Q3 are minimal, and are expected to offset each other. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 and $1.38, representing growth of 1.5% to 3% versus the prior year. We are pleased with the first half performance. And while we are facing a more difficult market environment than we were estimating a quarter ago, I am confident that our team will continue to deliver for our customers. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Mike for some closing comments before we take your questions. Mike?\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. During our Q4 '22 call in November, I shared with you that I believe Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong above-market results. My belief remains unchanged. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick to react to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. While the near-term outlook points to continuing challenges in the market, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in our end markets and our ability to continue to grow faster than the market.\nAs a trusted partner that our customers know they can rely on. Despite the current market environment, I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our shareholder value creation model. Our core values and approach haven't changed. Our focus on investing for growth, providing the industry's best customer support, our innovation prowess and being a great place for our team to work with a differentiated company culture are here to stay. They remain Agilent's formula for long-term success. Thank you. And now to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Sarah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

The Agilent's team delivered an excellent start to 2023, exceeding both top and bottom line expectations. Q1 revenues of $1.76 billion or up 10% core. Agilent's broad-based portfolio and resilient growth model are on a full display during the quarter with growth across all end markets and geographic regions. Operating margin in the quarter are 27.1%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.37 were up 13%.\nLet's now take a closer look at our first quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. Chemicals and Advanced materials led the way for us with another outstanding quarter, delivering 14% core growth with strength across all geographies. The strength in our pharma business continues and is up 11%, with both large and small molecule growing nicely. This is on top of 17% growth last year. Our environmental and forensics business grew 12%, while the academia and government and the food markets both grew 8%.\nOn a geographic basis, China once again led the way. Our China team continued their record of strong execution overcoming any disruption associated with COVID and delivered 13% growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations. In Europe, we also delivered stronger-than-expected results, growing 10%. The Americas shows a solid results with 8% growth.\nLooking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $1.03 billion, up 11% core. LSAG delivered growth across all end markets and regions. Our LC and LCMS platforms continued their strong performance during the quarter, growing fast in the market at 16%. Demand in the chemicals and advanced materials end market continues to be strong particularly for materials used in manufacturing semiconductors and batteries. Our Spectroscopy business grew more than 20% in the quarter, and we continue to strengthen our position in spectroscopy across multiple end markets.\nIn Q1, we announced the deployment of the Insight200M. This system is used at checkpoints throughout the London Heathrow Airport to officially provide enhanced security and ensure passenger safety.\nThe Agilent's CrossLab Group posted revenue of $381 million in Q1. This is up 13% core as the team continues to take advantage of record instrument placements over the past 2 years along with continued growth in attach rates. Across our team's deep knowledge of customer lab operations continues to drive consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. The breadth and diversity of our product offerings is driving record renewals for support contracts. At the same time, our Enterprise Services business continued its strong momentum, driving growth and converting competitive accounts.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $342 million, up 5% core. Our pathology-related business performed well with double-digit growth led by the Americas and Europe. NASD posted another strong quarter, growing 22%. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online mid-calendar year. In January, we announced an additional $725 million expansion of our NASD facility that will double our oligo manufacturing capacity. And 2 weeks ago, we were pleased to have the Governor of Colorado join us at our groundbreaking ceremony at the Frederick site. In addition to organic investments, we continue to invest externally in new technologies and partnerships. In the quarter, we welcomed the Avida Biomed team into Agilent, further enhancing our genomics capabilities. Avida is early-stage life sciences company designed to assist clinical researchers using NGS approach in the study of cancer.\nWe also continue to partner with new technology platform companies to drive our solutions in the marketplace. This quarter, we announced a partnership with the Akoya Biosciences to combine our companion diagnostic and IHC workload expertise with their solution to drive multiplex tissue assay development for biopharma.\nIn addition to these business group highlights, Agilent was again recognized among the top 100 Most JUST companies in the U.S. by JUST Capital and CNBC. As part of this announcement, we are very proud to be the leader in the medical equipment and services industry for our treatment of employees and focus on customer relations.\nThe Agilent team navigated challenging market uncertainties in Q1 and yet once again produced excellent results. It was a great start to the year. Q1 was another outstanding example of the work we've done to build a resilient company with multiple growth drivers. Those growth drivers create through targeted investments that aim to expand and enhance our business in high-growth areas are the heart of our Build and Buy growth strategy.\nAs we look ahead to Q2, we remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that continues to execute at an extremely high level and is well prepared to deal with any challenges they face. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our full year core revenue and EPS guidance while also keeping a close eye on macroeconomic conditions. I will provide the detail on our overall outlook, but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus and unmatched execution capabilities will continue to drive strong results.\nThank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated full year guidance and initial guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nWe are extremely pleased with our Q1 performance. It was a very solid start to the year. Q1 revenue was $1.76 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 10% core and 5% on a reported basis. Currency was a 5-point headwind, which was an improvement from the beginning of the quarter, while the M&A contribution was as we expected. Pricing for the quarter was higher than the full year forecast also as we expected. Now I'd like to share some additional detail on our end markets.\nResults in our largest market, pharma, were again very strong. Pharma grew 11% following 17% growth of last year. Performance was solid across both small and large molecules. Small molecule grew 12%, while large molecule grew 9%. And as Mike mentioned, Chemicals and Advanced Materials also continued to be very strong, growing 14% during the quarter on top of 15% growth last year.\nThe chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well while the advanced materials market continues to deliver outsized growth. Semiconductors and batteries are driving demand, helped by government investment in this area. The food market grew 8% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in China. The environmental and forensics business grew 12%, led by the Americas as increased testing for PFAS chemicals drives customer investment in this area and recently approved U.S. legislation leads to broad spending in the environmental market.\nOur business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 4% versus 11% growth last year. Pathology led the way for us here, partially offset by industry-wide challenges in the genomics market. And the academia and government market was up 8%, led by LCs and services. Regionally, Europe and Asia showed strong results.\nOn a geographic basis, the China team delivered 13% growth, and Europe grew 10%, both exceeding expectations. The Americas had another solid quarter coming in at 8%, in line with our expectations.\nNow let's turn to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.5%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gross margin performance, coupled with good cost discipline and SG&A helped drive our operating margin to 27.1%, up 80 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter, and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. And putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% from a year ago. In summary, Q1 ended with 10% core top line growth and 13% earnings per share growth, a very good start to the year. Now some metrics on cash flow and our balance sheet.\nIn Q1, we generated $296 million in operating cash flow, up 16% versus last year, while investing $76 million in CapEx. CapEx spending continues to be driven by our scale-up of our Train B manufacturing line and other capacity expansion projects. In the quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders through $67 million in dividends and by repurchasing shares worth $75 million. We also announced we're increasing our dividend by 7%, along with a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8.\nNow let's move to our revised outlook for the year and the upcoming quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and interest rates and currencies continue to be volatile. However, given the good start to the year, we are increasing our full year revenue to a range of $7.03 billion to $7.10 billion. This increase updates our full year core revenue guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, increasing the midpoint of our guidance to 6%. We've also seen the dollar weaken against major currencies in the first quarter although it has rebounded somewhat in February. And as a result, the full year guide reflects $100 million of favorable currency movements since our initial guide in November.\nAnd for the full year, we still expect currency to be an almost 300 basis point headwind to reported growth. In addition, we're also raising our full year EPS guidance to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 per share. And lastly, given the recently announced NASD expansion to double our oligo manufacturing capacity, we are updating our forecasted capital spending for the year to $500 million, up $200 million from our guidance at the beginning of the year.\nNow turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.680 billion. This represents core growth of 6% to 7.5% and reported growth of 3% to 4.5%.\nCurrency is expected to be a headwind of 3.1 points, while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth in Q2, which is consistent with Q1. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.24 and $1.27, representing growth of 10% to 12% versus the prior year.\nI'm pleased with how the team has delivered in the first quarter. We are focused on the things we can control. Our team is driving strong execution in the marketplace and coupled with our broad portfolio of products and services, we expect to continue to grow faster than the market as we go through the year. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThanks, Bob. Bill, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet. And thanks everyone for joining our call today.\nIn the fourth quarter the Agilent team continued its strong performance. We delivered an excellent quarter - significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations.\nRevenue of 1.85 billion dollars is up more than 17 percent core.\nOur strong top-line performance helped deliver fourth quarter operating margins of 29.1 percent. Operating margins continue to expand despite the inflationary environment and the strengthening dollar and are up 260 basis points from last year.\nEarnings per share of $1.53 are up 26 percent.\nThese Q4 results mark an outstanding finish to another strong year for Agilent in fiscal 2022. With full-year revenue of 6.85 billion dollars we delivered core revenue growth of 12 percent. This is on top of core revenue growth of 15 percent in 2021.\nOur operating margins continue to increase and are 27.1 percent for the year, up 160 basis points. Earnings per share of $5.22 are up 20 percent for the year.\nOur excellent results this year highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business and shine a light on the multiple growth drivers we've put in place over the years. They also continue to demonstrate the outstanding execution capabilities of the Agilent team. Throughout the year, we navigated market uncertainties, inflation, COVID-related shutdowns, and supply chain and logistics constraints.\nOur strength is broad-based, with all three business groups growing double digits for the year. All major geographies and regions grew double digits in FY22 after adjusting for our exit from Russia. This was highlighted by China leading the way, growing 18 percent. From an end market perspective, all markets expanded, led by excellent growth in our two largest markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials.\nAll in all, it was an extremely good year for Agilent.\nLet's now take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. During Q4, our performance was led by 20 percent plus growth in three of our six end-markets. Pharma, our largest market, posted 20 percent growth on top of 21 percent in Q4 last year.\nThe chemicals and advanced materials business grew 27 percent. We saw robust demand in chemicals along with secular growth in semiconductors, batteries, and other advanced materials.\nThe food market also grew 20 percent on strong end-of-year demand in China that had been previously delayed by COVID-related shutdowns.\nOn a regional basis, China led the way for us with stellar 44 percent growth as demand remained strong. Business activity continued to recover, and the Agilent team worked quickly and effectively to start working down the backlog including delivering remaining shipments deferred due to the Shanghai COVID-related shutdown in Q2.\nEurope also exceeded expectations by delivering double-digit growth in the quarter, coming in 14 percent higher than a year ago with broad strength across our markets, highlighted by low twenties growth in Pharma.\nLooking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group continued its outstanding performance and posted revenue of 1.12 billion dollars. This represents growth of 22 percent with the instruments business growing 24 percent, and our consumables and supplies business growing 15 percent.\nWe also saw excellent low thirties growth in our LC and LCMS instruments businesses as our solutions continue to resonate with customers.\nLSAG was also able to build on our leadership in applied markets with spectroscopy growing in the low twenties and the GC and GCMS business growing in the low thirties.\nIn addition, Agilent is doing its part to help customers monitor and manage microplastics in the environment as we released the latest version of the 8700 LDIR Chemical Imaging System. This unique system has been optimized specifically for the analysis of microplastics in environmental samples.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of 381 million dollars in Q4. This is up 14 percent core with broad-based strength across our entire portfolio of offerings. Pharma and chemicals and advanced materials both grew mid-teens for ACG.\nOn a regional basis, China led the way with high twenties growth as business continued to recover. ACG also delivered double-digit growth in the Americas.\nACG has delivered double digit growth for us every quarter this year, and our engagement with large enterprise customers continues to accelerate. Through its deep understanding and insights into lab operations, the ACG team continues to build strategic partnerships and long-term relationships that maximize customer value and provide ongoing demand for services and support.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of 352 million dollars, up 8 percent core.\nDGG's results were led by strong growth in the low twenties for NASD. As expected, our NASD business delivered higher quarterly revenue on a sequential basis given the planned shutdown last quarter.\nOur Genomics portfolio also posted solid results, growing low teens and, pathology grew mid-single digits.\nOn a regional basis, DGG also delivered mid-twenties growth in China.\nIn addition to these business group highlights, during Q4 Agilent was recognized by the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network as a world leader in advanced manufacturing. Agilent's manufacturing facility in Singapore received this recognition for deploying innovative technologies at scale in the manufacture of scientific instruments driving productivity while advancing sustainability.\nAlso, we were extremely pleased to announce a new multi-million-dollar partnership with Delaware State University, a leading historically Black university. The work we will do together with DSU is geared toward increasing the number of underrepresented students entering STEM fields.\nIn addition, Agilent was certified as a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute in more than 20 countries and regions around the world during the quarter. This recognition distinguishes Agilent as a top employer based on an independent survey of its global workforce.\nRecapping 2022, we had another very successful year not only delivering excellent financial results but building for the future. We continue to drive innovation, focus on supporting our customers, and executing our build and buy strategy to outgrow the market. The Agilent team continues to deliver.\nWe have built a resilient company with multiple drivers for growth and targeted investments focused on high growth areas. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that can take on any challenge and execute at an extremely high level.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we believe these qualities are a winning formula for continuing to deliver in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year, along with our initial view on expectations for fiscal year 2023. After his remarks I will rejoin to add some final comments and perspective.\nThank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nWe are extremely pleased with our Q4 performance and finished the year on a very strong note, exceeding our expectations on both revenue and earnings per share.\nQ4 revenue was 1.85 billion dollars, up 17.5 percent core and 11.4 percent on a reported basis. During the quarter, we saw the dollar continue to strengthen. Currency exchange rates were a 6.2-point headwind to growth or 103 million dollars. The contribution from M&A was as expected, adding one tenth of a point to reported growth.\nOur performance was again broad-based, as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. Orders also grew again during the quarter, while outstanding execution from our order fulfillment and supply chain teams enabled us to start working down our record backlog. As we enter FY23, our backlog is still elevated and helps provide good visibility and confidence in our outlook going forward.\nNow, I'd like to share additional detail on our end markets.\nResults in our largest market pharma, were very strong. This market represents 37 percent of Agilent's revenue and grew 20 percent in the quarter. Biopharma grew 18 percent and small molecule was up 21 percent. Looking forward, we expect the Pharma end market to grow high single digits in FY23.\nChemicals and advanced materials led growth for us during the quarter at 27 percent. This compares with 11 percent growth in Q4 last year. All three sub-markets -- chemicals, advanced materials, and energy -- had strong growth in the quarter. All regions grew as well, led by China.\nDemand continues to be driven by investments in advanced materials, driving secular growth opportunities in batteries, alternative energy, and semiconductors. While not immune to macro uncertainties, we believe these secular drivers in advanced materials will continue, helping to drive mid-single digit growth for this market next year.\nWe delivered growth of 20 percent in the food market, led by China as our results continued to benefit from the recovery of revenue delays due to COVID related shutdowns in Q2. During FY23, we expect the food market to normalize and grow in the low single digits after two years of very strong growth.\nThe environmental and forensics market posted 18 percent growth with particular strength in the Americas. This result was driven by increased governmental spending helping to drive technology refresh for newer applications like PFAS testing. Europe and China also posted impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. We see PFAS-related funding and demand continuing to be a driver for this end-market and expect mid-single digit growth next year.\nOur business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6 percent against an 11 percent compare last year. Growth was led by Europe and China, while the Americas grew low single digits. We also expect to see mid-single digit growth in this market in FY23.\nThe academia and government market grew 3 percent led by continued strength in our service business. This market grew 3 percent overall for the year as well, and looking forward, we expect similar growth in 2023.\nOn a geographic basis, China led the way with phenomenal 44 percent growth in Q4, driven by underlying demand across multiple end markets and our continued ability to quickly recover deferred revenue from Q2.\nAs we have discussed the last two quarters, the COVID-related lockdowns in China earlier this year deferred an estimated 50 million to 55 million dollars in revenue from Q2 into future quarters. This recovery started last quarter and our team in China continued their outstanding work to ramp production and shipments quickly in Q4.\nWe have now fully worked through this deferred revenue a full quarter earlier than originally anticipated back in Q2, a true testament to the entire team.\nWe estimate this recovery had a mid-single digit positive impact to China's Q4 growth. So even excluding this, our business performance in Q4 was very strong. Now looking ahead to next year, we expect China will continue to be a key growth driver for us.\nAnd as Mike mentioned, Europe grew a very solid 14 percent, which exceeded our expectations. We also posted 8 percent growth in the Americas, driven by pharma, chemicals and advanced materials, and strong growth in the environmental and forensics market, partially offset by academia and government. And lastly, the rest of Asia grew 12 percent.\nNow turning to the rest of the P&L, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 56.3 percent, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, along with pricing, helped overcome continued inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs. Our operating margin was 29.1 percent in Q4, up 260 basis points from last year.\nBelow the line, our tax rate was 14 percent for the quarter, as expected, and we had 298 million diluted shares outstanding.\nPutting it all together, earnings per share were $1.53 for the quarter, up 26 percent from a year ago, as Mike mentioned.\nSo, in summary, Q4 ended with 17 percent core topline growth and 26 percent EPS growth - a very strong finish to the year where we had revenue growth of 12 percent and EPS growth of 20 percent!\nNow, some metrics on our cash flow and balance sheet. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of 448 million dollars while investing 70 million dollars in capital expenditures. The capex spending is driven by our continued scale up of Train B for our NASD expansion.\nIn the quarter, we also paid out 62 million dollars in dividends and repurchased shares valued at 135 million dollars.\nFor the year, we returned almost 1.4 billion dollars to shareholders through 250 million dollars in dividends and a bit more than 1.1 billion dollars in share repurchases. And as we've indicated before, given the on-going strength of the business, we believe these share repurchases represent a very good long-term investment.\nOur balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.8.\nNow, let's move to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter.\nLooking forward to 2023, we enter the year with business momentum and a very healthy backlog. We also acknowledge the increasingly uncertain macro environment, rising interest rates, and currency headwinds and have reflected that in our thinking based on what we know today.\nFor fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of 6.9 billion to 7 billion dollars as we have significantly greater currency headwinds since last we spoke. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 5 to 6 and-a-half percent, in line with our long-range goals. Currency will negatively affect reported growth by 430 basis points or roughly 295 million dollars during the year based on fiscal year end rates.\nTo help with your modelling, at a business group level, this revenue guidance assumes mid-single digit core growth for LSAG, mid-to-high single digit growth for DGG, and high single digit growth for ACG.\nDespite ongoing currency headwinds and a continued inflationary environment, we are expecting operating margin expansion for FY23.\nBelow the line, we expect 40 million to 50 million dollars of net expense, a tax rate of 13.75 percent, which is slightly below this year, and 297 million shares outstanding.\nFiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.69. This range represents a growth rate of 7.5 to 9 percent versus the prior year and incorporates an estimated 4 percentage point headwind due to currency, net of our hedging activities.\nWe are also expecting 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion dollars in operating cash next year and CapEx of roughly 300 million dollars based on currently approved expansion projects, primarily Train B for NASD.\nWe have also announced raising our dividend 7 percent, providing our shareholders with another source of value.\nAnd finally, for Q1 2023, we expect revenue in the range of 1.68 to 1.70 billion dollars. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 6.8 percent to 8 percent while currency will be a 6.6-point headwind to reported growth. This outlook for the quarter incorporates the impact of the timing of Lunar New Year this year.\nFirst quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.29 and $1.31.\nMike will speak to this further in just a minute, but our diversified business model and the strength of our team are key assets for Agilent. These two elements produced an outstanding Q4 and full year 2022 and they have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in the coming year.\nAnd now, I will turn the floor back over to Mike for some closing comments. Mike?\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks Bob. Today's results are a strong indication that Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong results. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient, and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust.\nLooking ahead, we are all seeing increasing economic uncertainty. However, this company and team are built to successfully navigate any economic challenges we may encounter.\nThroughout the pandemic, we have stated that Agilent will emerge as a stronger company. Today's results are yet another proof point that we are well on our way in this journey. And, we're not done yet.\nWe continue to prioritize investments in growth. We are a resilient company with multiple growth drivers and unmatched execution capabilities. I'm quite confident we will continue to react quickly to changing conditions and deliver at a high level.\nThanks for being on the call. And now, I will turn things back over to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThanks, Mike. Beau, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable One Agilent team. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 13% core, this is on top of 21% core growth in Q3 of 2021.\nThird quarter operating margin of 27.5%. Operating margins continue to expand and are up 150 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%.\nOur strong results in Q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business. The momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. Let's take a closer look at our Q3 results.\nFrom an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our 2 largest markets, pharma and chemical and energy. Our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago. Within pharma, both the biopharma and small-molecule segments grew double digits.\nThe momentum in our C&E market segment continues, with Q3 growth of 22%. This is on top of 23% growth a year ago. The C&E market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space.\nWe're also very pleased to achieve double-digit growth in the food and environmental and forensic markets, with both markets growing 11%.\nIn our last call, I shared our belief that the business impact of the Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown would be transitory. I also expressed that we remain confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China.\nIn Q3, the China team delivered 29% growth. These stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the Shanghai area lockdown. We are also very pleased with this result, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the Agilent China team.\nStrength in Americas continued as we posted another quarter of double-digit growth on top of 32% growth last year. Our European business grew 6% against the 23% last year despite a 2-point headwind for the curtailment of our operations in Russia.\nIn terms of business unit performance, the [Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated] revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. Growth was broad-based, with continued strong demand for our LC and LC/MS offerings, where we posted high-20s growth.\nOur spectroscopy business grew low 30s driven by the strength in the advanced materials market. Chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our GC business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.\nLSAG's end-market growth is broad-based, with particular strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. Our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%.\nWe had an excellent showing at the recent ASMS conference, introducing several important LC/MS and GC/MS instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. These innovative and intelligent LC/MS and GC/MS systems have been designed to make the lives of our customers easier. To build an instrument intelligence and a higher-level instrument diagnostics helped maximize system uptime and improved lab productivity by allowing operators to focus on their analysis rather than their instruments.\nIn addition, we introduced an industry-first HydroInert source for GC single-quad and GC triple quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas, to lower-cost hydrogen.\nAnd rounding out the list of new products announced at ASMS, we introduced the MassHunter BioConfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow targeted at the fast-growing oligo-based therapy development market. These new products have already been well received by customers and represent the latest addition to Agilent's history of leadership in mass spectrometry.\nOur LSAG business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560C Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF system, winning the Scientists' Choice Award for Best New Spectroscopy Product.\nEarlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of PSS, Polymer Standard Service, a leader in polymer characterization. We're extremely pleased to welcome the PSS team and their technology to the Agilent family.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core. We grew 10% core even as lab activity continues to ramp in China. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Strong instrument placements and increased connect rates continued to be a driver for our service business as customers continue to see value in our ACG offerings.\nAnother critical important factor on our results is the scale and execution capability of Agilent's world-class global service delivery organization in service of customers to meet their needs as we're seen as the trusted company to work with among our global customers.\nThe Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. This is versus that compare of 37% growth last year. The solid results in our clinical cancer testing and NGS businesses were partially offset by COVID testing headwinds in the qPCR portfolio. In addition, the DGG business in China continues to ramp from the COVID-related shutdowns there.\nNASD revenues were up modestly in line with expectations. As we noted last quarter, Q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown in our oligo manufacturing line in Frederick, Colorado. The shutdown of Frederick was for both routine maintenance and development of key elements of our Train B., our new manufacturing line to increase our capacity, $150 million-plus, when fully ramped.\nWhile we continue to make good progress in the construction of Train B, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeting a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. We see continued strong demand for oligo-based therapies as the number of approved drugs continues to increase and the pipeline of drugs in development are targeting disease states with larger patient populations. We are more confident than ever in the long-term trajectory of the market and our business.\nIn addition to these highlights, I would like to also point to the recent release of Agilent's 2021 ESG report. While we've always published our progress and sustainability in addressing societal needs, this year, we've taken our approach to the next level. We addressed these issues in a new format, that for the first time, that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues.\nWe hope you have a chance to review our progress in ESG by checking out the report on the Agilent website, learning more about how we're executing our mission to advance the quality of life.\nAgilent's Q3 results again point to the strength of our diversified business and the outstanding execution ability of the Agilent team. We continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. Acceleration in digital orders growth continues as well as new customer acquisition.\nIn addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create One Agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. The strength of our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our One Agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination. And you see it in the results we're delivering.\nCustomer satisfaction hit another all-time high this quarter. We continue to outgrow the market. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and continued momentum, we're once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Bob will share more of the specifics.\nIt's an exciting time at Agilent, with the best yet to come. Thank you for being on the call today. And now, I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nWe are extremely pleased with our Q3 performance. Results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. FX was a 4.8 -- [4-point headwind to growth] or $76 million. Pricing for the quarter contributed over 3 points of growth year-on-year and improved sequentially. The performance was broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, the COVID-related lockdowns in China deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. Our team in China did a fantastic job ramping production and shipments faster than expected following the shutdowns. We estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in Q3, exceeding our expectations.\nGiven the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in Q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. The acceleration of the COVID-related shutdown recovery in China contributed to an already strong Q3 for the company. For perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery.\nAs Mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. This performance is against our most difficult comparison of the year as EPS grew 41% in Q3 of last year.\nNow let me dive a little deeper into the end markets. Our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations. Biopharma grew 18% and small-molecule was up 14%. Biopharma is a focus area for us and now represents 38% of our overall pharma business. We expect that ratio to continue to climb over time. In addition, all 3 business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment. And our LC portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us.\nChemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. We saw strength in plastics and packaging for chemicals and ongoing demand in advanced materials coming from the markets for semiconductors and batteries. In the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago. Strength in the food market was led by the Americas and China.\nOur environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter driven by the Americas and China. In the Americas, we saw increased funding to support PFAS testing, while China experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the Shanghai shutdowns for GC and GC/MS. The academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations.\nAnd rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. While not material at the Agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with COVID-related revenues being lower than last year. Excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter.\nOn a geographic basis, China led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns. And looking forward, demand in China continues to be very strong. The Americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and Europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations.\nNow turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. Our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year.\nBelow the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding.\nLooking at cash flow and our balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during Q3 driven by our NASD expansion. During the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. We paid out $62 million in dividends in Q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. Given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment.\nOur balance sheet continues to remain healthy, with a net leverage ratio of 1.\nNow let's move to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues for the full year to be in the range of $6.75 billion to $6.775 billion. This takes into account our Q3 results and an improved outlook in Q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. This represents core revenue growth of between 9.9% and 10.3%.\nWe are also raising our EPS guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year-on-year. This translates to Q4 revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and M&A will contribute 0.1 points.\nIn closing out our Q4 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 299 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. Our diversified business, and most importantly, our team, have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in Q4.\nAnd now, back to Parmeet, as we take your questions. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThanks, Bob. Hannah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Selena, and I will be your moderator. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThank you, Selena, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.\nThis presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com.\nToday's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30.\nAs previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements.\nWe will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. In Q2, the Agilent team again demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model. We delivered core revenue growth in line with our forecast, expanded operating margins and exceeded our EPS expectations. We did this while navigating a dynamic macro environment, including the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China.\nOur Q2 revenues are $1.61 billion. This is up 7% core and is on top of growing 19% in Q2 a year ago. Order performance was even stronger, growing double digits on a core basis. Second quarter operating margins at 25.3% continue to expand, up 140 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.13 are up 16%. We achieved these results despite the COVID-related lockdowns that closed our operations in Shanghai, starting in late March and continuing through the entire month of April. We estimate that this is roughly a 350 basis point headwind to our core revenue growth for the quarter.\nAs Bob will indicate when he takes you through the details, this business is not lost and is expected to be recovered through the rest of the calendar year. Most importantly, our team in China is safe, and we restarted limited operations in May at our GC factory and logistics center in Shanghai.\nFrom an end-market perspective, the pharma and chemical and energy markets again led the way for us. Our pharma business, Agilent's largest market, grew 13%, led by biopharma growing high 20s. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the pharma market. It also builds on top of the stellar 29% growth rate last year. The momentum in our chemical and energy business also continued this quarter, delivering 9% growth, in line with expectations and overcoming the shutdown of our primary GC production facility in Shanghai and the conflict in Ukraine. Growth was driven by advanced materials and chemicals.\nOn a geographic basis, the Americas again led the way with 13% growth built on top of 27% growth a year ago. Europe also performed well with growth coming in at 7%, following a 16% growth last year. China revenues were on track with our expectations through March, but we exited the quarter down 3% given the COVID-related lockdowns. While revenues were affected by the temporary shutdowns in the quarter, overall demand in China remains very robust. In fact, China was the fastest-growing region in Q2 from an order perspective, up about 20%. We remain very confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China.\nLooking at performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $896 million, an increase of 4% on a core basis. Given our manufacturing footprint and relative strength in China, LSAG was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns there.\nTo provide some additional perspective, all major product lines excluding GC-related products grew solidly in the quarter, led by strong performance in our cell analysis business growing in the mid-teens. Orders for LC and LC/MS continue to be strong. Orders grew mid-20s globally with particularly high adoption of our 2 new Bio LC products. On the LC/MS front, we look forward to announcing several exciting new offerings at the upcoming ASMS conference that will expand our portfolio. Our value proposition continues to resonate with our customers, and LSAG exited the quarter with record backlog.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenues of $353 million. This is up 10% core. Growth in services again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. The scale of our ACG business and breadth of portfolio continued to drive growth and margin expansion even in the face of inflationary pressures. Q2 marked the sixth straight quarter we delivered growth across all markets and regions.\nThe Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $358 million, up 15% core versus 16% last year. Our excellent growth was led by NASD and genomics. The NASD team could get another strong quarter, generating record revenue and profitability.\nDuring the quarter, I had a chance to visit our team in Colorado and see firsthand the excellent progress was being made meeting current customer needs and also the work underway in continuing to build for future growth with our Train B expansion. We remain extremely bullish about NASD's future. And with Train B come online in 2023, we're adding yet another $150 million plus in capacity.\nLooking across the company, our One Agilent approach and focus on our customers has never been stronger. During the quarter, we were ranked #1 in our industry and #2 overall in customer satisfaction in the Management 250 ranking developed by the Drucker Institute. In addition, new Agilent commercial organization is already resonating well and delivering successfully for our customers.\nAgilent's Q2 results are yet another proof point for how we build a resilient company that can quickly adjust with a change in environment and still post strong results. Given our results to date, along with our backlog and continuing order strength, we are again raising our full year core revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we are now expecting 8% to 9% core revenue growth and EPS of $4.86 to $4.93. Bob will provide more detail on our Q3 outlook along with more information on what we expect for the rest of the year. After Bob's comments and before we take your questions, I will be re-joining the call for some concluding remarks.\nThank you for being on the call today. And now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for the third quarter and the fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nAs Mike described, we posted solid top line results in Q2 while overcoming some difficult macro challenges in the business environment. Revenue was $1.61 billion, up a reported 5.4%. In the current quarter, currency was a headwind of 2.1 points, while M&A added 20 basis points of growth. Core growth was up 7.3%, in line with expectations despite the COVID-related lockdowns in China, which primarily affected us in April. We estimate the lockdowns deferred $50 million to $55 million of revenue into future quarters, impacting growth in Q2 by roughly 350 basis points. In addition, COVID testing-related revenues were roughly a 1-point headwind in the quarter.\nOur largest market, pharma, grew 13% during the quarter on top of 29% growth last year. Biopharma continued to be the main driver of results, growing 27% year-on-year, led by NASD. Investments in R&D programs and demand for instrumentation, consumables and critical components remained strong.\nPharma represented 37% of our overall revenues this quarter. To put that in perspective, in Q2 2019, effectively 1 year before the pandemic started, pharma represented just 30% of our business. This not only highlights the strength and resilience of this market, but it also demonstrates how our innovation and investments in higher-growth markets continues to pay off.\nChemical and energy continued its strong trend of positive results, growing 9% during the quarter despite the impact of the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine. Results were led by strong double-digit growth in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. We expect strong demand to continue in these areas, particularly in semiconductors and battery and clean energy technologies as industry-wide capacity expands.\nDiagnostics and clinical grew 5% on top of 13% growth last year as year-on-year declines in COVID-related revenues and the temporary shutdowns in China muted our results. The academia and government market was a nice surprise for us, growing 5% in Q2 on top of 21% growth last year. We saw an increase in spending in this market as more university labs opened up and students returned to on-campus learning. In addition, sales activity and the funding environment continues to be healthy.\nIn the food segment, we saw growth across all regions except for China due to the shutdowns. The higher concentration of food business in China drove the food segment to decline low single digits against a very strong comparison of 22% growth last year. In rounding out our end markets, environmental and forensics grew 1% versus an 8% growth last year.\nOn a geographic basis, the Americas grew 13%; Europe grew 7%; Asia, excluding China, grew 8%; while China declined 3% in the quarter as the lockdowns affected our manufacturing and logistics operations for over a month. Regarding China, I'd like to provide some additional detail on how the quarter evolved and how we expect to see the recovery progress.\nFirst, as Mike said, demand remained strong with the order growth of about 20% despite the temporary COVID lockdowns. Second, our business in China was tracking very well with our expectations through late March, when production and our main logistics hub in Shanghai were shut down and remain closed throughout April. We were able to partially reduce the impact of the lockdown by shifting production to other factories where possible and adjusting the shipping routes into and out of China. We expect the $50 million to $55 million in revenue to be recovered throughout the rest of the calendar year. So it is deferred, not lost.\nIn terms of phasing, we expect to continue to ramp our operations and anticipate modest recovery of the Q2 impact in Q3. We expect the majority of the recovery to occur in fiscal Q4 with some spillover into November and December, which is our first fiscal quarter of 2023. This phasing is baked into our updated guidance.\nNow turning to the P&L. The team continues to execute at a very high level. Second quarter gross margin was 55.7%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions and productivity helped offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain constraints and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage and strong cost management helped drive very healthy incremental improvements as we delivered an operating margin of 25.\n[0.3%], up 140 basis points from last year and exceeding our expectations.\nLooking at cash flow on our balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $283 million in the quarter while investing in $64 million in capital expenditures during Q2 with the year-on-year increase primarily related to the NASD expansion. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the transitory impact of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as increased inventory to fulfill strong demand in a challenging supply chain and logistics environment, as expected. We're still on track to deliver our cash flow forecast for the year.\nDuring the quarter, we again took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $234 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $297 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet continues to be healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. And earlier this month, we refinanced $600 million in senior notes opportunistically and now have no long-term debt maturing until 2025.\nAs we stated last quarter, our approach given current market conditions is to continue to be aggressive in deploying our capital. Given our strong balance sheet and confidence in the future, we intend to deploy another $250 million in opportunistic share repurchases in Q3 while continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities.\nNow let's move to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. Given the strong business performance in the first half of the year and our order backlog, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 8% to 9%, up a full point from our previous guide. This core revenue takes into account the recovery phasing in China as well as a $35 million or 55 basis point headwind due to the conflict in Ukraine.\nWhile we've increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has again strengthened considerably since our last guide, resulting in an estimated currency headwinds of $170 million for the year, up $60 million since our last guide, and the impact of M&A remains unchanged. This results in us maintaining our full year reported revenue guidance range of $6.67 billion to $6.73 billion for the full year.\nWe have also increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.86 to $4.93 per share. This is up from the previous range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share and now represents 12% to 14% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q3, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.625 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9%. We expect operations in China to ramp and be fully operational before the end of the quarter and continue to accelerate into Q4. Given the strengthening of the dollar, exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 4.7 points on the reported growth in the quarter.\nClosing out our guidance in Q3. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 300 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q2 under some very challenging circumstances. At the same time, our business remains strong, and I'm confident we will continue to deliver strong results in Q3 and through the rest of the year.\nWith that, Mike, I will turn it over to you for some concluding comments.\n\nMichael R. McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you on the current environment. As you know, we're living in very dynamic times. However, our end markets remain strong. Our Build and Buy growth strategy is working. What is also very clear is the ability of the Agilent team to continue to deliver in a challenging external environment. We have built a resourceful, quick-moving team and a resilient business model that has shown again and again, time after time, that we can successfully address any challenges or obstacles that come our way.\nWe delivered in-line growth, increased margin by 140 basis points and exceeded our EPS expectations during a time of rapidly growing inflation, continued supply chain challenges and the effects of a COVID-related lockdown in a key market. In times like this, our customers want to work with people and companies they can rely on. This works to our advantage, and I remain confident in our growth strategy continuing to deliver and in the power of the unstoppable One Agilent team. Our growth drivers remain intact, and our business prospects remain strong now and into the future. Thank you. And now back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThanks, Mike. Selena, please provide instructions for Q&A now.",

McMullen\n\nCEO, President & Director, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Our momentum continues. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2022 in Q1, exceeding the expectation of both the top and bottom line. Our Q1 revenues are $1.67 billion, this is up 9% core and up 8% reported. This is on top of growing 11% core in Q1 a year ago.\nExcluding COVID-19-related revenues, our core growth is even better at 10% this quarter. We continue to see strength in our order book with robust order intake throughout the quarter. In fact, Q1 orders grew roughly twice as fast as revenues. Q1 operating margins are a healthy 26.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.21 are up 14%. The EPS increases versus a tough comparison of 31% growth in the first quarter of 2021. These strong results have been achieved in a very dynamic environment. I could not be more proud of the Agilent team's ability to execute and deliver.\nLet's take a closer look at some of what's driving our strong results. Bob will go into more details later in the call, but our 2 largest markets continued strong double-digit growth. Our pharma business, Agilent's largest market, continues to lead the way for us, growing 17%. Global end market demand for our products and services remains very strong. Biopharma grew 32% while small molecule growth came in about at a robust 9%.\nThe momentum in our chemical and energy business also continues, delivering 15% growth in the quarter. This was driven by mid-teens revenue increases in Chemicals and Advanced Materials. PMIs remain positive, along with our overall outlook in the chemicals, energy and advanced materials markets.\nOn a geographic basis, our results led by 13% growth in the Americas. This is on top of 13% growth in Q1 a year ago. China grew 3% on top of 25% growth in Q1 of last year, and was impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year as noted in our November call. Demand in China remained strong as orders grew high teens in the first quarter.\nWe continue to invest in China for China to further strengthen our ability to serve our customers. We recently announced a $20 million expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing center to meet growing demand for our locally made liquor chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spec systems.\nLooking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $976 million, an increase of 7% on a core basis. This is versus a 10% core growth in Q1 of 2021. LSAG's growth was led by strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. From a platform perspective, customer interest and purchases of our chromatography systems and mass spec offerings are very robust. Our chemistries and supplies business, which moved over from ACG this year, continue to do very well, delivering double-digit growth.\nWe also continue to invest and strategically partner for future growth. Late last week, we announced the acquisition of very exciting artificial intelligence technology that will be integrated into our industry-leading chromatography businesses. This technology has the potential to significantly improve lab growth productivity and accuracy by automating manual interpretational chromatography data. We believe that this capability will be very well received by the high-throughput labs Agilent serves around the world. This acquisition is an example of our build and buy growth strategy as a complement to work, our internal R&D teams are going to develop these types of capabilities for other Agilent platforms.\nDuring the quarter, we also announced a partnership with Lonza to integrate Agilent's Anavex technologies and techniques into Lonza's Cocoon platform cell therapy manufacturing workflow. The collaboration has the potential to transform the way personalized cell therapies are manufactured. In addition, to ensure we can meet the strong and growing demand for our cell analysis offerings, we also recently announced plans to invest more than $30 million for the construction of a new manufacturing site in Chicopee, Massachusetts.\nThe Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenues of $359 million. This is up 10% core against 11% Q1 2021 core growth compare. This growth is broad-based with strength in service contracts preventative maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Our focus on providing a differentiated customer experience that leverages our large scale and talented customer support team continues to pay off. Our connect rate continues to improve, and our installed base continues to expand, both boding well for continued strength in our services business.\nThe Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $339 million, up 14% core versus Q1 '20 core growth of 15%. Our excellent growth is broad-based across pathology, genomics and NASD. Our Pathology business grew roughly 10% with strength across all regions. Our core genomics business grew low teens with strength in Target Enrichment and our genomics quality control product lines.\nThe NASD team continued to deliver, driving 45% plus growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, the additional capacity expansion at our Frederic GMP oligo manufacturing facility continues to proceed as planned. We continue to expect this capacity to come online by the end of calendar year 2022.\nOur resolution Bioscience team achieved a major milestone in the first quarter by completing the premarket approval submission for the resolution CTD expert liquid biopsy as an assay as a companion diagnostic. This was done in conjunction with the rate Therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer and is currently under review by the FDA. It is the first of what we hope will be several indications for liquid biopsy assays.\nI am pleased with how we have started the year. Building our Q1 results, continued order strength and execution prowess, we are increasing our full year financial guidance. We have raised our core growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8% and up 125 basis points at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance has increased to a range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, growing 11% to 13% over last year. Bob will provide the Q2 outlook along with more detail on our improved full year guidance.\nWe're very pleased with our Q1 results and are looking forward to another strong quarter and year ahead. I'm also very confident in our team and our ability to execute and deliver for our customers and shareholders no matter what the challenge.\nThank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to taking your questions later. However, for right now, I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert W. McMahon\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Agilent Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue, take you through the income statement, and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our improved outlook for the full year and our guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.\nAs Mike described, we posted very strong results in Q1 and exceeded expectations. Revenue was $1.6 billion -- $1.67 billion, up a reported 8.1%. Core growth was even better at 8.9% as we overcame a greater-than-expected negative exchange rate impact of 1.3 points, while M&A added 0.5 point to growth.\nQ1 core growth was 170 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. In addition, after adjusting for the 1 point headwind due to COVID-19 revenues, our core growth outside of COVID was roughly 10%. And as Mike said, order growth was even better. Again, a very strong start to the year.\nNow moving to our end market performance. Our results were driven by a continuation of strong growth in pharma, led by biopharma, while momentum in Chemical and Energy and our strong results in Diagnostics and clinical also led the way for us in Q1. Our largest market, pharma grew 17% during the quarter, on top of 20% growth last year.\nThe small molecule subsegment delivered high single-digit growth, while large molecule continued its strong performance, growing 32%. We are seeing our ongoing investments in biopharma paying off as demand was strong throughout the quarter. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the pharma market and that our business will drive above-market growth. Chemical and Energy continued to show strength, growing 15% during the quarter. Growth in Chemicals and Advanced Materials led the way, and we expect continued growth in this business.\nDiagnostics and clinical grew 11% on top of 9% growth last year, with all 3 business groups, again, expanding revenues nicely during the quarter. Our expansion of LC/MS equipment into the clinical space continues to do well. And our growth in China was particularly strong, increasing more than 30% as we continue to penetrate this market.\nThe academia and government market was flat in Q1. The business remained resilient despite Omicron impacts in the U.S. as some universities delayed in-person learning in the period following the holiday break in December and reduced lab activity in January. We have seen lab activity improve into February and believe the funding environment remains positive.\nThe Food segment declined low single digits against a very strong 22% growth comparison from last year. The Americas were a bright spot for us growing in the mid-teens, while Europe was flat and China was down due to difficult comparisons and Lunar New Year timing.\nClosing out the performance of the markets, environmental and forensics, our smallest market, was down 11%. For Agilent, overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q1, led by Americas at 13% and Europe at 6%. China grew 3% on top of 25% in Q1 last year in addition to the effect of Lunar New Year timing, which should benefit us in Q2.\nNow turning to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.1%, up 30 basis points from a year ago. Our team has done a good job increasing productivity and pricing has helped offset higher input and logistics costs. Operating margins of 26.3%, increased 80 basis points even as we have increased our R&D investments. Our investments in digital technology for our internal operations also continue to pay off as we leverage our infrastructure across the company using our One Agilent approach. Our tax rate of 14.25% came in as expected, and we had 303 million diluted shares outstanding, slightly lower than projected.\nPutting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 14% versus last year after growing 31% in Q1 of fiscal 2021. We continue to produce strong operational cash flow, generating $255 million in the quarter, beating our forecast while we also invested $75 million in capital expenditures during Q1. And during the quarter, we took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $447 million worth of shares. And we also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $510 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. And given current market conditions, we expect to continue to be aggressive in deploying capital.\nNow let's move on to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the second quarter. As Mike indicated, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 7% to 8%, up from our initial guide in November of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding the COVID-related 0.5 point headwind this year, our new full year core revenue growth results in 7.5% to 8.5%. This new guidance takes into account our strong Q1 results and an improved outlook for the rest of the year on a core basis.\nWhile we've increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has strengthened considerably, doubling the estimated exchange rate headwinds from our initial guide to $110 million for the year, while M&A impact remains relatively unchanged.\nPutting it all together, we're expecting full year revenues to be between $6.67 billion and $6.73 billion. In addition, we've increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.80 to $4.90 per share, up from the previous range of $4.76 to $4.86, and representing 11% to 13% growth versus fiscal year 2021.\nFor Q2, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.595 billion to $1.625 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9% after adjusting for an expected 0.5 point impact related to COVID year-on-year, and we expect reported growth in the range of 4.6% to 6.6%. Exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 2.3% in the quarter, while M&A is expected to contribute 0.3 points to growth.\nIn closing out our Q2 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.12, up 13% to 15% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14.25% tax rate and 303 million diluted shares outstanding.\nAgain, the Agilent team performed extremely well in Q1. And with the solid growth we're seeing in orders and the team's willingness and ability to take on every challenge that comes their way, I'm confident that Q2 and our full year results will also be strong.\nWith that, Parmeet, back to you for the Q&A.\n\nParmeet Ahuja\n\nVP of IR, Agilent Technologies India Private Limited\n\nThanks, Bob. Emily, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.",

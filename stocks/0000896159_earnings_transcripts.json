Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you, and welcome to our September 30, 2025 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter. In fact, a record earnings quarter. Core operating income of $3 billion was up 29% leading to EPS of $7.49 per share, up 31% from a year ago, both supported by record underwriting and investment results as well as solid premium revenue growth.\nThe results put a point on the broad-based and diversified nature of our company, geographically, by customer segment and by product area. Most of our businesses and regions of the world contributed. Geographically, that means North America, Asia, Latin America and U.K., Europe, when I say customer segments that contributed strong growth this quarter, that means globally, both consumer, homeowners and auto, specialty personal lines life and international A&H.\nWhen I say commercial P&C, particularly middle market and small commercial our E&S business, crop insurance and a broad range of large account casualty and financial lines and growth was generated by numerous distribution sources. Brokerage agency, phone-based direct marketing and digital. In short, a wide variety of diverse businesses and geographies that are contributing to growth globally.\nOur balance of business and presence about half U.S. and half outside provides a wide range of opportunities which supports long-term profitable growth. Importantly, it also supports our ability to manage the commercial P&C cycle with discipline. Something we are well known for doing. We expect to continue generating superior margin and earnings growth and, in fact, an increase to our return on shareholder equity.\nIn the quarter, record underwriting income on both a published and current accident year ex-cat basis was supported, of course, by a quiet cap quarter. But more importantly, by current underwriting year margin improvement and strong prior period development. Published underwriting income of $2.3 billion was up 55% from a year ago, with a record combined ratio of 81.8%, about 6 percentage points better than a year earlier.\nThough cat losses were light in the quarter, rest assured, catastrophe risk is alive, well and obviously, by definition volatile. Remember, the California wildfires first quarter and convective storm activity through much of the year. Cat volatility aside, our underlying underwriting results were simply excellent in the quarter.\nCurrent accident year underwriting income, excluding cats, was a record $2.2 billion, up 10%, supported by a combined ratio of 82.5%. The nearly a full point improvement from prior year, with most all of it coming from loss ratio improvement. On the invested asset side, for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was a record $1.8 billion, up 8.3%.\nOur fixed income portfolio yield is 5.1% and our current new money rate is averaging 5.2%. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was quite strong at $4.5 billion, which is contributing to strong growth in our invested assets, which is up nearly 10% over the last 12 months.\nCurrent fiscal financial and economic conditions favor attractive fixed income and alternative asset portfolio returns for our growing invested asset, federal budget deficits, inflation and rotation from the dollar support what we believe will be a steeper yield curve as we look to the future, which in turn should support our reinvestment rates and future investment income growth.\nTangible book value growth, our primary measure of wealth creation with 17% per share from a year ago and 6.6% from the previous quarter. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 24.5%, simply an outstanding result. Peter is going to have more to say about financial items in a couple of minutes.\nTurning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Total company premiums grew 7.5%, with consumer of almost 16% and commercial up 3.3%. The Commercial P&C growth this quarter was impacted by 2 items that benefited North America last year. Our underlying renewable commercial P&C business grew about 5.5%, which is more representative of our run rate.\nPremiums in our life insurance division grew over 24.5%. In terms of the commercial P&C underwriting environment, I would characterize the market globally is in transition. Competition continues to grow. Especially large account-related short tail business, both admitted and E&S.\nA lot more capital is chasing the property business and prices are softening while terms and conditions remain steady. On the other hand, middle market and small commercial property is more disciplined and orderly though greater competition is beginning to show as expected, particularly in upper middle market.\nIn mid-market, property rates continue to rise, but naturally at a slower pace. Casualty pricing overall large account, E&S and middle market is also slowing, though it continues to firm in the areas that require rate. It's quite rational. Financial lines remain soft but we're seeing signs of firming in discrete classes. I'll give you some more color by division. For a change, let's begin this quarter with our international business.\nPremiums in our Overseas General division were up 9.7% or nearly 7.5% in constant dollars. Consumer was up 15.5% and commercial lines grew nearly 6%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia grew over 14%. Europe grew almost 5%, and Latin America grew over 10.5%. Consumer lines grew more than 25% in Asia and more than 12.5% in Latin America.\nPremiums in our London wholesale business were over 8.5%. Our international retail and E&S business, again, illustrates the power of Chubb diversification. In our international retail commercial business P&C rates were down 1.3%, and financial lines rates were down over 8%. Turning to North America. Total P&C premiums were up 4.4% and including over 8% in Personal Lines and 3.5% growth in commercial.\nAdjusting for the 2 nonrecurring items, we wrote last year that did not repeat this year, renewable premiums in our North America commercial business grew 6.2%, with P&C lines up 5.8% and financial lines up almost 8.5%. Drilling down our North America high net worth personal lines business generated more than $1.8 billion in net written premium for the quarter.\nThis business is now almost as large as our North American middle market and major accounts commercial businesses. each with premiums in the quarter of $2.1 billion, again, illustrating our company's diversification. Premium growth for our true high net worth segments was about 11.5%. On the commercial P&C side in North America, premiums in our middle market business, we're the second largest writer in the U.S., grew 4.1% to $2.1 billion.\nMiddle market workers' comp growth was impacted by one of the 24-year items I mentioned, namely an annual retrospective premium exposure adjustment. We make it -- which we make every year in the third quarter. That benefited us much less this year than last. Adjusting for that, we grew middle market almost 7% with P&C lines up 8.6% and financial lines flat.\nPremiums in major accounts and specialty grew 2.5%, and with major up 3.2% and E&S, up 6.6%. The major accounts division was up 5.6%, adjusting for the impact of a large one-off LPT written last year. In North America Commercial, we had a very good quarter for new business. was up 24% versus prior year, with double-digit growth in major specialty, middle market and small commercial.\nOur renewal retention rate on a policy count basis was over 86%. Commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding financial lines and comp was up 4.3% with rates up 2.4%, an exposure change of 1.9%. Property pricing was flat with rates down 3.3%, an exposure change of $3.5 million. And going a step further, property pricing was down 13.5% in large account business in E&S and up 6.2% in middle market and small commercial.\nCasualty pricing in North America was up 8% with rates up 7.5% and exposure up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down almost 2%, and the workers' comp primary comp pricing was flat, while large account risk management pricing was up almost 5%. In North America, commercial there was no change to our selected loss cost trends.\nIn our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 26.5% we had a large onetime premium in New Zealand, and adjusting for that, growth was up just over 16.5 million in North America, combined insurance company premiums were up 18%. Our Life division produced $324 million of pretax income in the quarter, up over 14%.\nChubb's fundamentals and our positioning are excellent. We're performing at a high level, almost anywhere you look in the company. We have broad global diversification and a disciplined energized and talented team of professionals whom I couldn't be more proud of to call my colleagues. We are reaping results and planting seeds for the future.\nOur digital and AI efforts, years in the making are contributing to growth and beginning to transform the company in how we do business. Our balance sheet, starting with loss reserves has never been stronger. We estimate that 70% to 80% of our businesses present attractive growth opportunities. And looking forward from all we can see our performance is enduring.\nWe will maintain superior earnings growth, including double-digit growth in EPS, book intangible book value and core operating ROE increasing to 14-plus percent over the medium term. In the quarter, we stepped up share buybacks and because we are an excellent investment with our stock trading well below intrinsic value.\nIncreased buyback activity will continue while at the same time, we will continue to build additional capital and our invested assets. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter now, and then we're going to come back and take questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you have just heard, we had another strong quarter that produced 9-month records in our 3 primary sources of earnings. Our results were supported by $4.5 billion of adjusted operating cash flows and exceptional balance sheet strength, including all-time highs in both book value of nearly $72 billion and cash and invested assets that exceeded $168 billion.\nThere are a few capital related matters I'd like to touch on. First, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter. including $385 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases. And Secondly, we issued approximately $2.2 billion of debt at a weighted average cost of 4% and an average term of about 12 years.\nBook and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively, for the quarter and 10.4% and 14.8% from the prior year. Our core operating return on tangible equity and core operating ROE were 24.5% and 16.3%, respectively, for the quarter. Pretax catastrophe losses were $285 million for the quarter, principally from weather-related events split 86% U.S. and 14% international, and $2.6 billion through 9 months versus $1.8 billion over the same period last year.\nPretax prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was favorable $422 million, comprising $460 million of favorable development in short tail lines and $38 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $61 million, mostly environmental related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 83% and 87% year-to-date.\nTurning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio, which had an average book yield of 5.1% for the quarter increased over $7.5 billion from the prior quarter. The increase reflects strong operating cash flow as well as positive mark-to-market and favorable FX, partially offset by shareholder distributions.\nAdjusted net investment income was $1.78 billion, which was above our previously guided range by approximately $40 million due to higher-than-projected private equity income as well as higher call premium and strong cash flows into the portfolio.\nTo give you a bit more color this quarter, approximately 87% of investment income was generated by our fixed income portfolio, which is relatively predictable and growing steadily. The balance of our investment income is from private investments and other sources which while growing more quickly are more variable from quarter-to-quarter.\nWe now expect adjusted net investment income in the fourth quarter to be between $1.775 billion and $1.1 billion next International Life premiums written growth in the quarter of 26.5% included a favorable onetime large transaction of $126 million, without which growth would have been 16.6%.\nThe contribution from this transaction to life insurance segment income was de minimis. Our core operating effective tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, which is above our previously guided range due to shifts in mix of income by tax jurisdiction in particular related to prior period development [indiscernible] as a result, we expect our core operating effective tax rate for this full year to be in the range of 19.2%.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

My name is Greg, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to today's Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, you have the floor.\n\nKaren L.

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.

Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter. Core operating EPS was a record $6.14, up 14% from a year ago, supported by record underwriting, strong investment results and good premium revenue growth. All of our businesses and regions of the world contributed to the quarter's growth, particularly in North America, our middle market and Small Commercial, Personal Lines and E&S businesses. and in international, both commercial and consumer P&C in all regions and life insurance in Asia and the U.S. Core operating income of $2.5 billion was a record result, up 13%.\nThe results demonstrate the broad-based diversified nature of our company geographically by customer segment and product area. Our balance of business and presence provides us a wide range of opportunities, which supports long-term sustainable and profitable growth. In the quarter, we produced record underwriting income on both the published and current accident year ex cat basis, supported by premium growth and underwriting margin improvement.\nPublished underwriting income of $1.6 billion was up 15% from a year ago, leading to a combined ratio of 85.6%, more than 1 percentage point better than a year earlier. Current accident year underwriting income, excluding cats, was up almost 11.5%, supported by a combined ratio of 82.3%, again, nearly a full point improvement from prior year. On the invested asset side, for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was nearly $1.7 billion, up 8%.\nOur fixed income portfolio yield is 5.1%, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.4%. Our operating cash flow in the quarter, which supports investments was quite strong, $3.2 billion. Given federal deficits, a weakening dollar and our country's trade policies, I expect the trend is towards higher inflation and a steeper yield curve, which is an issue for our country but will support our company's continued growth in investment income.\nTangible book value growth, our primary measure of wealth creation was up 23.7% per share from a year ago and 8% from the previous quarter. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 21%, very strong result. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment.\nGlobal P&C premiums, which exclude agriculture, grew 5.8% and 6.4% in constant dollars, with commercial up 4.2% and consumer up 11.9%. Premiums in our Life Insurance division grew almost 17.5%. In terms of the U.S. commercial P&C underwriting environment, large account-related short-tail business, both admitted and E&S has grown quite competitive. A lot more capital is chasing the property business and prices are softening, while terms and conditions remain steady. We are, of course, disciplined and we're not going to write business below an adequate price. While others are leaning in, we've begun walking away where necessary.\nOn the other hand, middle market and small commercial property remain much more disciplined and orderly. Rates continue to rise, and we're growing property in this area. Casualty continues to firm in all areas that require rate, retail and E&S, both large account and middle market. And again, we are growing. While financial lines remain soft, we're seeing signs of firming in discrete classes. That is backdrop, I'll give you some more color by division. Beginning with North America, P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 5.3%, including growth of 9.1% in Personal Insurance and 4.1% in commercial. P&C lines up 4.2% and financial lines actually up 3.6%.\nIn Commercial, we had a good quarter for new business, up 7% versus prior year, driven by middle market across the board and in large account and E&S casualty lines. Our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 86%. Premiums in our leading middle market division grew 8.4%, another excellent result with P&C up 10% and financial lines up 2%.\nOur Small Commercial business grew about 10% Premiums in our Major Accounts and Specialty division grew 1.5% with our large account business essentially flat and our E&S business up 5.6%. Both were heavily impacted by premium reductions in property. Overall commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding financial lines and comp was up 4.5%, with rates up 1.6% and exposure change of 2.9%. Property pricing was down 2.5% with rates down about 7%, offset by exposure change of 4.9%. Importantly, going a step further, property pricing was down more than 12% in large account business, both admitted and E&S and it was up over 8% in middle market and Small Commercial.\nCasualty pricing in North America was up 11.6%, with rates up 10.6% and exposure up 0.9%. Financial lines pricing was down 1.2% and in workers' comp, primary comp pricing was essentially flat, while large account risk management pricing was up over 7.5%. In North America Commercial, our selected loss cost trends remained steady across the board. No change from what I gave you last quarter.\nOn the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had a simply outstanding quarter, with premium growth exceeding 9%. New business growth was more than 17%. Homeowners pricing was up 10.2% in the quarter and ahead of loss costs, which remained steady at 8.9%. I expect the kinds of results we're showing in personal lines to endure and continue.\nTurning to our international general insurance operations. Premiums were up 8.5% or over 10% in constant dollar. Commercial lines grew about 7% and consumer was up more than 15%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia grew over 12.5% in constant dollar. Europe grew over 8% and Latin America grew over 17%. Premiums in our London wholesale business were up over 7%.\nIn our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up just 0.5% and Financial lines pricing was down over 6.5%. The loss cost trend in our international retail business remains steady. Like in North America, large account commercial property shared and layered has become much more competitive, particularly in London. While in the rest of the world, property is growing more competitive, conditions remain reasonably orderly, though they vary by market.\nIn our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 18% in constant dollar. And in North America, combined insurance companies premiums grew over 17%. Our Life division produced $305 million of pretax income in the quarter, up about 10.5%. As you know, the economic and geopolitical environment is dynamic and evolving. We're in a period of greater uncertainty. The U.S. recently passed tax legislation and efforts towards deregulation should support economic growth.\nOn the other hand, budget deficits, trade and immigration policies and a weaker dollar are potential headwinds that can impact both economic growth and inflation. The picture is complex. With that as context, Chubb's fundamentals and our positioning are simply excellent.\nOrganizationally, we're performing at a high level, coupled with our broad-based global diversification and a disciplined, energized and talented culture of professionals. As I observed at the beginning of the year, roughly 80% of our businesses have good growth and continued growth prospects. There is a lot of opportunity, and I have confidence in our ability to continue to grow both top and bottom line at a superior rate, tax and FX notwithstanding. To reinforce from all I can see overall, I expect the company's pattern of growth, revenue and earnings to continue. Now I'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and we're going to take some of your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you've heard from Evan, we had another strong quarter that contributed to quarterly and 6-month records. Our results were supported by exceptional balance sheet strength, including all-time high in book value of $69 billion and cash and invested assets of $160 billion. Additionally, the quarter produced adjusted operating cash flow of $3.2 billion. There are a few capital-related matters I'd like to touch on.\nIn May, our Board authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program that took effect on July 1 with no expiration date. In the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $388 million in dividends and $676 million in share repurchases. Book and tangible book value per share grew 6.1% and 8%, respectively.\n[Audio Gap]\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nAnd at this point, we're happy to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2025 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings and financial supplement which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial tests. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Good morning.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nLet me begin with a few words around the external environment. There is currently a great deal of uncertainty and confusion surrounding our government's approach to trade. It's impacting business and consumer confidence as well as our image broad. The odds of recession have risen substantially and higher inflation is all but certain to what degree is an open question.\nWe have competing priorities between our stated trade, economic and fiscal objectives and coherence of policy has yet to emerge. I hope we can reach agreements on trade, reduce or eliminate tariffs and reconcile our priorities quickly. Certainty and predictability are [ jacks ] to open for confidence. Growth in the image of our country as a leader, a liable partner in a place to do business.\nAs you saw from the numbers, we had a good first quarter. Considering the significant catastrophe losses we incurred in the California wildfires. In terms of revenue growth, the headline number was impacted by foreign exchange due to a strong dollar since weakened substantially and onetime premium related items in our Northern Market business.\nWe produced $1.5 billion in core operating income, and it was down 31%. It was supported by excellent underlying underwriting results, double-digit growth in investment income and strong life insurance Total company premiums grew 5.7% in constant dollars. Our published combined ratio was 95% with underwriting income of $441 million, a notable result given $1.6 billion of cat losses.\nCalendar year underwriting income was supported by a current accident year combined ratio of 82.3%, a nearly 1.5 point improvement from prior year. Excluding cats, current accident year underwriting income was up 12%. Additionally, we had favorable prior year reserve development $255 million.\nOn the asset side for the quarter, adjusted net investment income was $1.7 billion, and it was up 12%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5%, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.5%. Tariffs and the federal budget deposit impact interest rates yield curve, spreads, asset values and the dollar in ways that are not good for our country.\nAs a company, we are predominantly buy and hold fixed income investors and benefit from higher yields and as a multinational, our revenue and income benefit from a weaker dollar. In the quarter, our alternative investments produced modestly lower than usual private equity distribution-related income. It's a combination of simply normal volatility on financial market conditions.\nOur annualized core operating return on tangible equity in the quarter was 13%. Peter is going to have more insight about the financial items. As you saw in the first quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Liberty Mutual's business in Highland and Vietnam. 2 companies offer a range of consumer and commercial P&C products with distribution through 56 branches and 2,600 brokers and agents, both fit well with our own business.\nThe combined operations produced about $275 million in premiums in 2024, over 90% of which is in Thailand. For perspective, Thailand is now over $1 billion in premium revenue for Chubb, non-life and life, and we're among the leading P&C companies in the country once the entities are emerged. In fact, we'll be #4. We closed Thailand April 1 and expect to close Vietnam by early '26. Now turning to growth. pricing and the rate environment.\nP&C revenue grew 3.2% in the quarter, 5% in constant dollars, with commercial up 4.6%, consumer up Adjusting for the onetime items in North America, P&C premium revenue grew over 6.5 in constant dollar. All regions of the world contributed favorably Premiums in our Life Insurance division grew over 10%. In terms of the commercial P&C underwriting environment, large account-related short tail business, both admitted in E&S is growing quite competitive.\nA lot more capital is chasing the business, prices are softening. We are, of course, disciplined and we're not going to write business a little bit technically adequate price. On the other hand, middle market and small commercial property, both admitted retail and non-admitted wholesale E&S remain much more disciplined and orderly.\nRates, in fact, continue to rise, and we are growing in this area. Casualty continues to firm in all areas that require rate, retail and DS with large count middle market. And again, we're growing. Financial lines remain soft. That as backdrop, I want to give you some more color by division and we'll start with North America, where premiums were up 3.4% and Growth again was impacted by the 2 onetime items I mentioned, reinstatement premiums related to the California wildfires in Personal Insurance, a larger-than-usual one-off structured transactions, I think loss portfolio transfers written last year in our major accounts commercial division.\nAdjusting for both North America was up 6.4%, including growth of 10.1% in personal insurance, 5.3% in commercial. Commercial P&C lines were up 6.4% on and financial lines were down 1.3%. Looking through those onetime items, it's a more representative view of our run rate growth for North America commercial P&C.\nPremiums in our very large middle market division increased almost 8%, an excellent result. P&C up over 10% and financial lines down about 2%. Premiums, are our major account and specialty division declined 1.7%. And adjusting for the onetime transactions, they were up 3.1%. 3.6% in P&C and Financial lines down. Major and Specialty is comprised of E&S business, which was up 10.7% on and our major accounts retail business, which was down 1.3%.\nOverall commercial pricing for property and casualty, excluding fin lines and comp, was up 8.3%, with rates up 6.4%, an exposure change of 1.8%. Going to step further, property pricing was up [indiscernible] with rates down 0.7, offset by exposure change of 3.8%. For property, pricing was down 9.6% in large account business, both admitted and E&S and up 10.2% in middle and small, again, both admitted and in-house.\nCasualty pricing in North America was up 13.4%, with rates up 12.6% and exposure up 0.7. Financial lines pricing was down 3.2%, and that's all rate. In comp, primary comp pricing was flat, while large account risk management was up 7.5%. In North America Commercial, our selected loss cost trend is [indiscernible] to $6.5 million casualty running 8.9% and property 4.5%.\nWe are mindful of a full impact tariffs could have on short tail lines of business and are watching closely. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another very strong quarter with premium growth of [ $10.1 million. ] Adjusted for the reinstatement premiums. New business growth was almost 20%. Premiums in our upper high net worth segments grew over 16%.\nHomeowners pricing was up 12.5% in the quarter and ahead of loss costs, which are running 8.7%. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Premiums were up 1.8% and or 6.5% in constant dollar. The dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter versus a year ago, but a substantially declined in value versus major currencies in recent weeks. In the quarter, International Commercial lines grew about 7.5%. Consumer was up 5%.\nFrom a region of the world perspective, Asia and Latin America both grew 6.1%, while Europe grew 5.5%, including growth of 6% on the content. While premiums in our London wholesale business were up nearly 8%. In our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up $2.6 and financial lines pricing down 5.5%. Loss cost trends in international retail are, in fact, down at 80 basis points from 24.8% to 5%. Our Global Reinsurance business had a strong quarter with premium growth of 14%.\nIn our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, Premiums and deposits were up 15.5% in constant dollar. And in combined insurance company, our U.S. worksite business grew 18.6%. Our life division produced over $290 million of pretax income in the quarter, up 15.7% in constant dollar. In summary, we are in the risk business. Volatility is a feature. While we are impacted by the wildfires, our underlying fundamentals are excellent.\nWe had a good quarter. And as I observed at the beginning of the year, about 80% of our global P&C business, commercial and consumer and our life business with very good growth prospects. In fact, when you listen as I read to you and describe going across divisions, the growth rate of the various businesses, FX aside, I think that speaks to the broad nature and the 80% I'm talking about.\nThere is a lot of opportunity, and I'm mindful that the external environment has become more uncertain. I have confidence in what we can control in that regard, in our ability to continue growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate, tax and FX notwithstanding. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. Our strong first quarter results were supported by exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity. Book value now stands at $65.7 billion and reached an all-time high of $164 on a per share basis, and total invested assets were $152.3 billion. The quarter produced adjusted operating cash flow of $2 billion, including approximately $600 million of net loss payments for California wildfires.\nIn the quarter, we returned $751 million of capital to shareholders, including $385 million in share repurchases and $366 million in dividends. The average share price on our repurchases for the quarter was $286.18. Book value for the quarter was favorably impacted by unrealized mark-to-market gains on our high-quality fixed income portfolio due to declining interest rates. Book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively, for the quarter.\nAs you know, rates have since backed up. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter was 13%, while our core operating ROE for the quarter was 8.6%. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $1.64 billion. Excluding the California wildfires, the approximately $170 million balance was principally weather-related split 74% U.S. and 26% internationally.\nPrior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a favorable $268 million pretax with favorable development of $313 million in short-tail lines, a mix of commercial and consumer and unfavorable development of $45 million in long-tail commercial lines. Turning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.67 billion which was at the lower end of our 6-month guidance and was negatively impacted by approximately $25 million of lower than usual private equity distributions and realizations and $10 million of unfavorable FX movements.\nThe income generated from our public fixed income, private credit and strategic holdings portfolio has performed in line with expectations. While the direction of financial markets remain uncertain and volatile, we expect second quarter adjusted net investment income to be at the midpoint of our previously guided 6-month guidance. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 87% or 86% excluding cats, PPD and agriculture.\nOur core effective tax rate was within our previously guided range of at 19.1%. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. And at this point, we're happy to take the."

[Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our December 31, 2024 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call.\nOur report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website site at investors.chubb for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team.\nIt's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to speak about the terrible tragedy surrounding the California wildfires, the lives lost and tremendous loss of property, a major disaster still unfolding. Our job and the role we play in society is to support our policy holders. Our colleagues have been on the ground, supported by Chubb colleagues throughout the U.S., [ covering ] to assist those clients who have lost property, been displaced from their homes and businesses, had their lives severely disrupted. While it doesn't erase the enormous difficulty they have and will continue to experience, we're doing all we can in small and big ways to ease their burden. Our thoughts are with those who have suffered, and our gratitude goes to those firefighters and emergency workers who served tirelessly.\nFrom a financial perspective, our current estimate of the cost of supporting our customers and helping them recover and rebuild from their catastrophe is $1.5 billion net pretax and is a first quarter 2025 event.\nNow turning to our results for the fourth quarter '24, which you have all seen, we had a great quarter, which contributed to an outstanding year, in fact, the best in our company's history. For the quarter, record P&C underwriting income with a world-class combined ratio of 85.7%, together with another quarter of record investment income, led to core operating income of $2.5 billion. Operating earnings were up 9.4% on a pretax basis, were 10.5% per share, though after tax they were distorted by the onetime tax benefit we received last year. Looking through that, operating income was up over 7.5% after tax.\nGlobal P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 6.7% in the quarter, with good contributions from our P&C businesses globally, both North America and overseas general. Premiums in our Life Insurance division grew 8.5% constant dollar.\nFor the year, we generated operating income of $9.1 billion, up 11.5% adjusted for the onetime tax benefit, and 13% on a per share basis. Looking more broadly, over the past 3 years, core operating income has grown over 65% and is nearly double the amount from pre-COVID 2019.\nAll 3 major sources of income for our company produced record results last year. P&C underwriting income of $5.9 billion was up over 7% with a published combined ratio of 86.6%. Adjusted net investment income grew 19.3% to $6.4 billion. And Life Insurance income topped $1 billion.\nFor the year, we grew global P&C premiums 9.9% and life premiums 18.5% in constant dollar. Shareholder returns were strong. Our core operating ROE was about 14%. And our return on tangible equity was 21.6%.\nPer share book and tangible book value grew 8.8% and 14.1%, respectively.\nOur results, top and bottom line continue to demonstrate the broad and diversified nature of the company and the consistency of contributions from our businesses around the world, North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, both commercial and consumer. As we look forward to 2025, we have good momentum and are optimistic about the year ahead, both top and bottom line, CAT losses and FX notwithstanding.\nReturning to the quarter. Our underwriting performance was outstanding, while absorbing a more normal level of CAT losses. P&C underwriting income was $1.6 billion. And the current accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, was 82.2%, more than 2 points better than prior year and also a record result.\nOur prior year's reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $213 million and $856 million, respectively, and speaks to the strength of reserves, the conservative nature of our loss reserving practices.\nOn the asset side, we're investment managers, our other business, and we added another excellent quarter in terms of performance. Our invested asset now stands at $151 billion, and it will continue to grow. For the quarter, adjusted net investment income was a record $1.7 billion, up 13.7%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5% versus 4.8% a year ago, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.6%. Peter will have more to say about financial items.\nTurning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Again, Global P&C premiums increased 6.7% in the quarter, with commercial up 6.4% and consumer up 7.5%. All regions of the world contributed favorably. Life premiums grew 8.5%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market trends or themes were consistent with those in the previous quarter. Property has grown more competitive in large accounts, shared and layered and E&S, while pricing is favorable. Casualty is stable or firming depending on the class, and overall pricing is ahead of loss cost track. And financial lines, particularly D&O and employment practices liability is where more competition is reaching for market share at the expense of current accident year underwriting margins.\nOverall market conditions are favorable, and we see good growth opportunity for over 80% of our Global P&C business, commercial and consumer, as well as for our life business. North American overseas general, Asia, Europe and Latin America, each with many areas of favorable growth opportunity. Our middle market and small commercial businesses globally, our U.S. E&S business, our U.S. high net worth business, global A&H and life, international personal lines, our digital business, and specialty businesses such as our growing Climate Plus business.\nNow turning to the quarter. Let me give you some more color by division. Beginning with North America, premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 6.3% and consisted of 10% growth in personal insurance and 5.1% growth in commercial, with P&C lines up 7.2% and financial lines down 2.9%. We had another strong quarter for new business, up over 22% versus prior year. And our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90.4%. These again speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance.\nPremiums in our major account and specialty division increased 4.6%, with P&C up 5.8% and financial lines down 1.7%. Within Major and Specialty, our Westchester E&S business grew 8%. Premiums in our middle market division increased 6.2%, with P&C up 10% and financial lines down 5%. Pricing for property and casualty, excluding financial lines and comp, was up 9.9%, with rates up 8.2% and exposure change of 1.6%.\nFinancial lines pricing was down 3.3%, with rates down 3.6%. And workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.7%, with rates up 2.5% and exposure up 2.1%.\nBreaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 6.9%, with rates up 3.5% and exposure change of 3.3%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.7%, with rates up 11.8% and exposure up 0.8%. Loss costs in North America remains stable, no change and in line with what we contemplate in our loss picks.\nOur North America commercial lines business ramped an amazing 83.9% published combined ratio for the year, again, an amazing result. In agriculture, where we are the market leader, our crop underwriting result this quarter were excellent, and we finished the year with $354 million in underwriting profit. Premiums were down from prior year due to lower commodity prices and the formulas for risk sharing with the government.\nOn the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter, with premium growth of 10%, including new business growth of 34%. Premiums in our true high net worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known for, grew 17.6%. Our homeowners pricing was up over 12% in the quarter and ahead of loss cost trend, which remains steady. For the year, we ran an outstanding 83.6% combined ratio in our high net worth personal lines business.\nTurning to our international general insurance operations. Premiums in the quarter for our retail business were up 7.7%, with commercial lines up 10.3% and consumer up 4.7%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia Pac led the way with premiums up 12.2%. Europe grew 8.2%, including growth of 12% on the continent. Latin America grew just 2.5% and was impacted by foreign exchange. If you adjust for that, Latin America was up 11.5% in constant dollars.\nIn our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up 3.7% and financial lines pricing was down more than 6%. Premiums in our London wholesale business were essentially flat. They were up 1.1%, with prices down 4% as the London market continued to grow more competitive. For the year, our overseas general business ran an excellent 86.4% combined ratio.\nOur Global Reinsurance business had a strong quarter with premium growth of about 20% and finished the year with premiums up 32% on a combined ratio of 85.9%, reflecting a more disciplined reinsurance market both property and pockets of casualty.\nIn our international life business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up over 26% in constant dollar. In combined insurance company, our U.S. worksite business grew 17.8%. Our life division finished the year with pretax income of $1.1 billion, which was ahead of what we originally projected for the year. We have good momentum in our life business which continues to build.\nIn summary, we had a great quarter and a great year. While we're in the risk business and there's plenty of uncertainty in the world, we're confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate, tax and FX notwithstanding. Our earnings growth will come from 3 sources: P&C underwriting, investment income and life income.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan, and good morning. As you just heard, we concluded the year with another strong quarter, contributing to record full year results across our 3 primary sources of earnings. Our balance sheet finished the year in an exceptionally strong position, with book value of $64 billion and total invested assets of $151 billion.\nThe quarter and full year produced adjusted operating cash flow of $4.2 billion and a record $15.9 billion, respectively. It's also worth noting that during the quarter, A.M. Best affirmed our company's rating and stable outlook. And in January, S&P affirmed our rating and stable outlook.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $725 million in share repurchases and $367 million in dividends. We returned $3.5 billion in total for the year, including $2 billion in share repurchases and $1.5 billion in dividends, which represented approximately 38% of our full year core operating earnings. The average share price on repurchases for the year was $269.23.\nBook value for the quarter and the year was adversely impacted by unrealized mark-to-market losses on our high-quality fixed income portfolio due to interest rate changes, which we expect to amortize back to par over time, as well as foreign exchange losses. Book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2.9% and 4.3%, respectively, for the quarter, and 10.8% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year.\nOur core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 22% and 21.6%, respectively, while our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 14.3% and 13.9%.\nTurning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio, which now has an average book yield of 5%, produced adjusted net investment income of $1.69 billion, which included approximately $25 million of higher-than-normal income from private equity. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate between $1.67 billion and $1.75 billion over the next 6 months.\nRegarding underwriting results, the quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $607 million, of which $309 million was from Hurricane Milton and $140 million from Hurricane Helene. The remaining balance was principally from weather-related events, split 31% in the U.S. and 69% internationally.\nPrior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a favorable $352 million pretax, with favorable developments split 17% in long tail lines, primarily from general casualty, and 83% from short-tail lines, primarily from property and agriculture.\nOur corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $139 million, primarily asbestos-related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 83%.\nOur core effective tax rate was 18.2% for the quarter and 17.5% for the year. which are below our previously guided range due to the shifts in mix of income. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for 2025 to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, including the transition cash tax benefit provided on the adoption of the new Bermuda income tax.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L.

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another great quarter. We produced core operating EPS of $5.38, up 9.3%. Premium revenue growth reflects strong results in our businesses around the world, North America P&C, International P&C and Life Insurance demonstrates the broad-based diversified strength of our company. Our underwriting results were simply excellent. We published a combined ratio of 86.8%. We grew investment income within 25%, and Life segment income was up 8.7%, with international life up double digit.\nCore operating income for the quarter was $2.2 billion, bringing year-to-date operating earnings to $4.4 billion, up 13.5% and a record 6-month result. P&C underwriting income in the quarter of $1.4 billion was essentially flat as a result of higher cat losses globally. As you know, it was an active quarter for the industry. Our losses of $580 million compared with $400 million prior year, and they were in line with our modeled expectations, while last year's second quarter losses were light.\nOn our next cat current accident year basis, underwriting income of $1.8 billion was up over 11%, with a combined ratio of 83.2%, both were record underwriting results. Investment income topped $1.5 billion, up nearly 26% and a record as well. At June 30, our reinvestment rate is averaging 5.9% and our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9% versus 4.5% a year ago. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates. Our invested asset now stands at $141 billion, and we expect it to continue growing.\nLife segment income of $276 million was right in line with our plan. Our annualized core operating ROE for the quarter was 13.3%, with a return on tangible equity of over 21%. Peter will have more to say about financial items.\nTurning to other matters, growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased 11.8% in the quarter or 12.3% in constant dollars. We are a large, diversified global insurer, and our growth this quarter is again a reflection of who we are. Growth was broad-based geographically by product and customer segment, both commercial and consumer, from North America commercial to North America consumer, international commercial, Asia, Europe and Latin America to international consumer, particularly Asia and Latin America.\nIn terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions remain favorable in both property, which is naturally more competitive and casualty, which is firming in those classes that require rate. Loss cost inflation remains steady within what we have contemplated in our pricing and our reserving. Property has become more competitive as more capital is entered. Our book is well priced and terms and conditions remain steady. Casualty is firming in the areas that need rate, and we see this trend in casualty enduring. And I'm going to give you some more color by division.\nSo let's start with North America. Premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 8% and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal lines and 6.7% growth in commercial with all P&C lines, including comp up 8.7% and financial lines down about 3%. We wrote over $1.3 billion of new business, which is a record, and our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90%, both speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance.\nPremiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 6.5%, with P&C up about 8% and financial lines down 2.5%. Our E&S business grew about 8.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7.5%, with P&C lines up almost 11% and financial lines down 4.5%. Again, the underwriting environment in North America is generally favorable and rational, financial lines aside. P&C pricing, excluding financial lines and comp, was up 8.3%, with rates up 5.5 and exposure change of [ 2 7 ]. Financial lines pricing was down 3.2, with rates down about 3.5 and exposure up 0.3.\nAnd workers' comp, which includes both primary and large account risk management comp, pricing was up 4.2%, with rates up 1.6% and exposure up 2.6%. And breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 5.3, with rates up about 1.1, an exposure change of 4.2. Large accounts shared and layered in E&S property pricing was flat to down. While in the middle market, rates continue to rise about 7%.\nWe are big in all 3. And again, all 3 are priced adequately. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.7%, with rates up 9.9% and exposure up 1.6%. Loss costs in North America remains stable in line and in line with what we contemplate in our loss picks, loss cost for P&C, excluding financial lines and comp, are trending at 7.3%, with short-tail classes up 5.3 in casualty, excluding comp, at 8.6. We are trending our first dollar work comp book at 4.6%.\nAs I said, when it comes to financial lines, the underwriting environment and a number of classes is simply not smart. We are trading growth for a reasonable underwriting margin. We are trending financial lines loss costs at just over 5%.\nOn the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter, with premium growth of over 12%, including new business growth of 30%. Premium growth for our true high net worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known for grew 17%. These numbers are really impressive when you consider our high net worth personal lines division is almost a $7 billion business.\nOur homeowners pricing was up 14.6 in the quarter, while the loss cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Net premiums were up over 16.5% in constant dollar. Our international commercial business grew nearly 14%, while consumer was up almost 21. Asia Pacific led the way with premiums up 36%. And excluding China's contribution, premiums were up over 9%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 12%, and Europe retail grew over 9% with the continent of 11. 41% of our overseas general divisions premium is consumer, both A&H and personal lines, and it's growing at a good clip.\nIn the quarter, premiums in our International A&H business were up over 10.5%, led by Asia Pacific and Europe. Our international personal lines business had another excellent quarter with growth of 32%, led by Asia Pac and Latin America. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio with retail, property and casualty lines pricing up 6.1 and financial lines pricing down 4.1.\nLoss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8, with P&C lines trending 6. 1 and financial lines trending 4.8. In our international life insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 31.7% in constant dollar. Excluding China, like premiums were up almost 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency, brokerage, bank assurance and direct marketing distribution channels. International Life earnings grew over 15% in the quarter in constant dollars.\nLastly, Global Re had a strong quarter, with premium growth exceeding 40% and a combined ratio of 72.7%. Growth was property driven, both risk and cap. And in the quarter, we wrote more one-off structured transactions, which contributed to our growth.\nIn summary, as you could see, we had a great quarter. And again, our results reflect the strength, the breadth and the depth globally of the company. We are confident in our ability to continue growing our operating earnings at a superior rate through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and life income.\nI'm going to turn the call over to Peter, then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you know, our balance sheet and overall financial position are very strong and just got stronger, benefiting from our first half results. Our underwriting and investment results continue to generate substantial capital and significant positive cash flow. Our book value reached over [ $61 million ] or $151 per share and adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter and through 6 months were 3.6 and a record $7.2 million, respectively.\nWe returned $939 million of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $570 million in share repurchases and $369 million in dividends, and $1.6 billion in total through 6 months. While containing [indiscernible] book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.6% and 3.1%, respectively, for the quarter and 4.9% and 6.1%, respectively, year-to-date, benefiting from core operating income, partially offset by capital return to shareholders noted earlier.\nIn addition, we closed on 2 small acquisitions this quarter, healthy pause of [ PEG ] insurance business and Catalyst Aviation, which together diluted tangible book value by about $300 million. Core operating ROE and return on tangible equity were 13.3% and 21.1%, respectively, for the quarter, and 13.6% and a record 21.6%, respectively, year-to-date.\nTurning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.56 billion, which included approximately $30 million of higher-than-normal income from private equity and other areas. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to average approximately $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion for the remainder of the year.\nRegarding underwriting results. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $580 million, which were principally from weather-related events let 75% in the U.S. and 25% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $285 million pretax with $144 million in North America Commercial, $64 million in North America Personal, $61 million in overseas general and [ $15 million ] in Global Re. The $285 million was split 35% long tail lines, predominantly in North America commercial and [ 65% ] in short tail lines.\nOur corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $93 million mostly coming from molestation-related claims development. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 71% and 77% year-to-date. Our core effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which is within our guided range. We continue to expect our core effective tax rate to be within 18.75% to 19.25% for the remainder of this year.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. We'll be happy to take your questions."

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our March 31 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. I'd like to introduce our speakers this morning.\nFirst, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. We had an excellent start to the year. Core operating income was up double digit, driven by all 3 sources of income. P&C underwriting income was up over 15% with a published combined ratio of 86%. Investment income was up more than 23% and life insurance income was up almost 10%.\nWe produced double-digit premium revenue growth from across the globe with strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C and international life businesses. Core operating income was up over 20% to $2.2 billion and operating EPS was up nearly 23% and $5.41. As you saw, our earnings and EPS benefited modestly from 2 onetime items that partially offset each other.\nAdjusting for these, they were up 18.6% and nearly 21% $5.33. Again, our P&C underwriting income was up over 15% to $1.4 billion, driven by strong earned premium growth and great underwriting margins. The ex-cat current accident year combined ratio was 83.7%. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income of nearly $1.5 billion was up 23.5%.\nWe now have more than $140 billion in invested assets, up over 19% in the last 2 years. And our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9%, versus 4.4% a year ago. Our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.1%. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow well as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates.\nLife segment income of $268 million was up 9.8%. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.7%, with a return on tangible equity of nearly 22%. Peter will have some more to say about financial items.\nTurning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 14%. For Global P&C, which excludes agriculture, net premiums increased 13.3% in the quarter, with commercial up over 11% and consumer up over 19%.\nP&C premium growth in the quarter again was balanced broad-based globally between areas of the globe and commercial versus consumer, reflecting favorable underwriting and market conditions overall. Life insurance premiums and deposits were up over 39%, driven by our business in Asia and came from a number of countries and distribution channels.\nHuatai contributed 2.9% and 20.6 percentage points, respectively, to the global P&C and life growth results. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions were quite favorable in both property and casualty, and price increases exceeded loss cost while REIT decreases in financial lines slowed.\nSo starting with North America, premiums, excluding agriculture, were up over 10%, and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal insurance and about 9.5% growth in commercial, P&C lines up 13% and financial lines down about $7.5 million. If we adjust the P&C growth to the net impact from 2 items in the major accounts division, P&C lines normalized growth was a very strong 11.6%.\nThe 2 items were an unusually large structured transaction we wrote partially offset by the previously discussed corrective underwriting actions in primary and excess casualty that are continuing to wind down over the next few quarters. By the way, that large structured transaction negatively impacted North America Commercial's combined ratio by over 0.5 point, with the loss ratio impacted by over 1 point.\nExcluding this impact, unmask the current accident year combined ratio run rate. Supporting North America P&C growth was record new business of over $1.2 billion at a very strong renewal retention on a policy count basis of 84.7%. Both speak to the tone of the market and our excellent operating performance.\nPremiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 12% with our large account retail business up 12% and our E&S business up about 10.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7% with P&C lines up 10.6% and financial lines down 6.5%. Again, the P&C market environment in North America overall is quite favorable and rational financial lines aside.\nPricing increased 12.8% including rate of 9.4%, an exposure change that acts like rate of 3.1%. From our very large middle market business to small commercial to personal lines, and driven by both property and casualty, we saw the best rates in pricing overall that we've seen in the last 4 to 5 quarters.\nIt was one of the best quarters for large casualty pricing. In our North America business, rate increases for property and casualty exceeded loss cost trends, let alone pricing, which was even stronger. So let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Property pricing was up 13%, with rates up 7.8% and exposure change of 4.8%.\nCasualty pricing in North America was up 13.1% with rates up 10.9% and exposure up 2%. And in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.8% with rates up 0.2% and exposure up 4.6%. Loss costs in North America are relatively stable and in line with what we contemplate in our loss specs.\nWe are trending loss costs at 6.8%, short-tail classes at 5.3% and long tail, excluding comp, at 7.6%, trending our first dollar workers' comp book at 4.6%. For financial lines, the underwriting environment and a number of classes in a word is simply dumb. Rates continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. We are, of course, trading growth for underwriting margin and income where we need to.\nIn the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines in aggregate were down 3% and 2.7%, respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at just over 5%. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter.\nThis is a powerhouse business over $5.5 billion in premium last year, and it grew over 12% in the quarter with new business growth of nearly 35%. It speaks to a franchise and a class of its own in terms of service and capability. Premium growth for our true high net worth Premier and signature segments, the group that demands the most underwriting and servicing grew 16.5%.\nIn our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. While a small quarter, our agriculture business had a very good underwriting result as the '23 crop year turned out a bit better than we projected.\nTurning to our international general insurance operations, net premiums were up 17.5% or [ 16 sub ] at constant dollars. Our international commercial business grew 11.4%, while our consumer was up over 26%. Growth this quarter was geographically diverse with all major regions contributing, which again illustrates the true global nature of the company.\nAsia led the way with premiums up 40%. Excluding Huatai's contribution, premiums were up 7.7%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 13%, while the continent of Europe grew 10.3%. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio, retail property and casualty lines pricing up 5.5% and financial lines pricing down 2.3% million.\nLoss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8%, with P&C lines trending 6.1% and financial lines trending 4.8%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our Personal Lines division had an exceptional quarter, with constant dollar growth of 47%, led by Asia and Latin America. By the way, the modest increase in overseas General's ex-cat current accident year combined ratio this quarter was primarily due to the consolidation of our China business.\nIn our international life insurance business, which is overwhelmingly Asia, premium and deposits were up over 50% in constant dollar, with strong contributions from Taiwan Hong Kong, China and Korea. Excluding Huatai HighLife, premiums and deposits were up over 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency brokerage and direct marketing distribution channels.\nLastly, Global Re had a strong quarter with premium growth of almost 30% and a combined ratio of 76.9%. We allocate incrementally more cat capacity to our reinsurance business and grew both our cat access and risk property portfolios, in particular, this quarter. In summary, we had an excellent quarter and start to the year. We remain well positioned to continue producing outstanding results through the balance of the year and beyond.\nWe remain confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a rapid pace through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and lifing. Now I'm going to turn it over to Peter and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan. As you all just heard, we continue to build on the momentum of our record 2023 year with strong growth in top line and earnings per share this quarter. We continue to effectively manage our balance sheet and ended the quarter in a strong financial position, including book value that exceeded $60 billion and cash and invested assets of $143 billion, each topping last quarter's all-time highs. Adjusted operating cash flow was $3.6 billion.\nThere were 2 onetime earnings items this quarter that I would like to touch on. First, we recognized an incremental $55 million deferred tax benefit related to the new 2023 Bermuda corporate income tax law. This resulted from finalizing our review of 2 smaller subsidiaries since last quarter. We don't expect additional deferred tax gains related to this law going forward.\nSecond, there was a contribution made to the Chubb Foundation, charitable foundation of $30 million pretax or $24 million after tax. These items provided a net benefit of $0.08 per share.\nAdditionally, there were 2 other noteworthy items in the quarter. In March, we issued $1 billion of 10-year debt to retire existing debt due to retire -- mature in May 2024. Lastly, we closed on an additional 9% of shares of Huatai that brought our ownership interest of 85.5%. This leaves the last tranche of less than 1% of outstanding Huatai shares remaining to close.\nDuring the quarter, book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, from December 31, driven by strong operating results partially offset by $350 million in dividends and $316 million in share repurchases in the quarter.\nTurning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.48 billion, slightly beating our guidance of $1.45 billion. We expect our adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion next quarter and to go up from there.\nTurning to underwriting results. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $435 million, which is modestly lower relative to prior year and is principally from winter storms and other weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $216 million pretax with favorable development of $311 million in short tail lines, primarily from property and credit-related lines, and $95 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines, which was primarily from excess casualty and was within our range of expectations.\nOur corporate runoff portfolio had unfavorable development of $9 million pretax. Our paid to inferred ratio for the quarter was 84%. Our reported core effective tax rate was 15.2% or 17.3% for the quarter, excluding the update to our Bermuda tax benefit.\nAs I've said before, our first quarter tax rate also tends to be the lowest of the year, due to certain tax benefits associated with equity award vesting and stock option exercises. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take the questions."

Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. We had an outstanding quarter and finish to the year. In fact, a record year. Our quarter's results included double-digit premium growth. Record P&C underwriting and investment income and strong life operating income, all leading to exceptional operating earnings on both a per share and dollar basis. Our results, both earnings and book value related were also positively impacted in a significant way by a onetime deferred tax benefit related to Bermuda's new income tax law.\nWhile the quarter's results are impressive and important, it's the full year result that really matters most. All things being equal, one quarter hardly tells a story. Our full year results were simply stunning. Core operating income topped $9.3 billion, up 45% or $8.2 billion, excluding the tax benefit, up 28%. P&C underwriting income was a record $5.5 billion, with a combined ratio of 86.5% and investment income was up 33%, and top $5.3 billion.\nAs you can see, the balance between underwriting income and investment income was about 50-50, a very healthy balance. Life income was over $1 billion, while consolidated [ premium ] revenue growth was 13.5% for the year. For the year, our core operating ROE was 15.4% and our return on tangible was 24.2%, tax benefit contributed. So excluding that, our core operating ROE was 13.6% and our tangible ROE was 21.6%, excellent numbers.\nFinally, for the year, per share book and tangible book value each grew by over 20%. All divisions of the company in major geographies contributed to these outstanding results last year, and I want to congratulate and thank my colleagues around the globe. Our results speak to the global nature of this organization, which is one of the things that distinguishes Chubb.\nOur fundamentals are very strong, and the quarter itself was simply a continuation of the year. For the quarter, core operating income was $2.3 billion, excluding the tax benefit, were $5.54 per share, up 36% and 39%, respectively. The onetime tax benefit then added $1.1 billion or $22.76 a share. Our underwriting in the performance in the quarter was a result of strong earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins with a published combined ratio of 85.5% at a current [indiscernible] year of 84.3%.\nWe had strong prior period reserve development in both North America and overseas general and relatively light CAT losses. P&C underwriting income for the quarter was $1.5 billion. Our prior year reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $177 million and $773 million, respectively, which speaks to the consistent strength of our loss reserves. At year-end, our loss reserves we're in an exceptionally strong position, as strong as they have ever been.\nOn the invested asset side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.5 billion was up $369 million or 33% over prior year. Our portfolio yield at the end of the year was 4.3% versus 3.6% a year ago, and our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 5.3%. We have very strong liquidity, and our investment income run rate continues to grow as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. Peter will have more to say about financial items.\nNow turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 13% in the quarter, with P&C up 12.5% and Life up 20%. Of the P&C 12.5%, consumer lines were up 20% and commercial P&C was up 10%, which is, in fact, stronger than the full year average of 8.6%. Our premium revenue growth in the quarter was well spread globally. And from a broader perspective, for the full year, growth was 13.5%, with P&C up 10% and Life up 52%.\nAgain, Chubb is a globally diversified company, and our growth last year demonstrates the broad-based nature of our operations. North America commercial P&C, a very large and important business, representing 40% of the company, grew 7.5%. The balance of the company, the other 60% grew 18%. U.S. high net worth personal lines grew 11%. International Consumer P&C grew 18%. International Commercial P&C grew over 11% and Life grew 52%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, the pattern was the same as we have experienced all year. Price increases in the quarter and property and casualty lines, exceeded loss costs in both North America and our international division, while globally, rates and prices continued to decrease in financial lines, led by D&O.\nGetting to the details of the quarter and beginning with North America. Premiums were up 9.4% or 6.2% excluding agriculture. Consisted of growth of 12.1% in personal insurance and 4.4% in commercial insurance. Within the 4.4%, P&C lines were up 6.3% and financial lines were down 2.1%. Unpacking the 4.4%, which was obviously slower than previous quarters, First, our middle market division had another strong quarter with P&C premiums up 9.8%, while financial lines were essentially flat. Our E&S business had a strong quarter with growth of 16% in our wholesale brokerage lines. On the other hand, our division, which serves large corporates, major accounts grew only 1.4%.\nGrowth in major was adversely impacted by about 7.5 points or $125 million of premium from underwriting actions we planned for and took in a segment of our primary and excess casualty business. 1/2 of the reduction in premium was the result of increased client retentions with the balance due to lost business. For clarity, these actions, in fact, contribute to future growth in underwriting income.\nRegarding future North America commercial growth, as we said in the press release, given current market conditions and our capabilities across all segments of commercial P&C, including large accounts, E&S and middle market, we fully expect to return to more robust growth beginning with the first quarter. Overall pricing for total North America commercial increased 7.3%, including rate of 5.1%, and exposure change that acts like rate of 2.1%.\nLet me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Pricing for commercial property and casualty was strong, up 12.4%. Property pricing was up [ 17.3 ] with rates up 12.9% and exposure change of 3.9. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.4%, with rates up [ 10.8 ] and exposure up 1.4. In workers curve, which includes both primary and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.6%, with rates up 1.1, and exposure of 3.5%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.6%, with short-tail classes at 5.5% and long tail, excluding comp, at 7.3%. We are trending our first dollar workers' comp book at 4.6%.\nFor financial lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&A and rates continue to decline. We owe this business extremely well and our trading growth for underwriting margin and income where we need to. In the quarter, rates and pricing from North America financial lines in aggregate were down 6.1% and 5.5%, respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at 5.1%.\nFor our agriculture business, late-season drought-related developments in crop insurance resulted in an elevated combined ratio for the quarter and the year. For context, we published the 95.4% combined ratio for the year and earned an underwriting profit of $146 million, similar to the previous year's result. Crop insurance is a CAT light business by its nature, vulnerable to weather volatility, but with very good risk/reward dynamics, if managed well. Crop insurance has been a great business for Chubb. [indiscernible] is an amazing company. And since acquiring them in 2010 for about $1.1 billion, we burned almost $2 billion in operating profit with an IRR of 26%.\nOn the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had a simply outstanding quarter and year. In the quarter, premiums were up over 12%, and new business growth was up 34%. There was a continued flight to our product, service and capability.\n[Audio Gap]\ncombined ratio of 89.7 or 80.1% on a current [indiscernible] year ex-CAT basis. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss cost trend remained steady, 10.5%.\nTurning to our international general insurance operations, which had an outstanding quarter. Net premiums were up 19.3% and the combined ratio was 85.9%. Our international commercial business grew 13.2%, while consumer was up 29.5%. For the year, overseas general grew 14%. And our international business growth this quarter was broad-based with all major regions producing double-digit growth.\nAgain, illustrating the global nature of the company, Asia led way with premiums up 37%, made up of commercial lines growth of 21% and Consumer up 56%. Europe and Latin America had very strong quarters as well, with growth of 15.5% about for both. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio with pricing in our retail business up over 7%.\nProperty and Casualty line pricing was up over 10%, while Financial lines pricing was down about 2%. Loss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8. P&C lines trending 6% and financial lines trending 4.9%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our A&H and Personal Lines divisions both had strong quarters and for the year, their growth was 14.4% and 21.4%, respectively.\nGrowth at [indiscernible] was led by Asia. In our international life insurance business, which is basically Asia, premiums were up 26%. For the year, we reported Life income of just over $1 billion or about $950 million adjusting for some nonrecurring items.\nSo in summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to another record-setting year and we are well positioned to continue producing outstanding results going forward. Underwriting conditions overall are favorable, although they vary by business and geography. It's an underwriter's market, and that's what we are.\nWe have hit the ground running in '24 and while we are in the risk business and volatility is a feature of that we are confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a double-digit pace through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income, life income. Now turning the call over to Peter, then will come back, take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you've just heard from Evan, our strong performance continued into the fourth quarter and we ended the year with a record results in all 3 sources of earnings. P&C underwriting income, Investment income and Life income. Additionally, our book value of nearly $60 million and book value per share of $146.83 were both all-time highs.\nBefore I go into further detail on our results, I want to touch on the $1.14 billion onetime deferred tax benefit [indiscernible] in the quarter. This tax benefit is a result of the Bermuda corporate income tax law enacted in December, which requires a onetime step-up of the tax basis for assets in Bermuda to fair value. This onetime benefit represents a permanent increase to book value and tangible book value and will be realized over a 10-year period starting in 2025. Please refer to Page 1b in the financial supplement for the impact of this benefit on our key metrics.\nDuring the quarter, per share book and tangible book value increased 12.2% and 20.2%, excluding the tax benefit. This increase reflects strong operating results and net realized and unrealized gains of $4.9 billion in our investment portfolio due to declining interest rates partially offset by $1.1 billion of dividends and share repurchases. For the full year, book and tangible book value per share increased 18.2% and 17.5%, excluding the tax benefit. The increase also included the diluted impact on the tangible equity related to [ Wan Tai ] consolidation on July 1, which has since been fully recovered.\nTurning to investments. Our portfolio grew over 20% since last year, reaching $137 billion at year-end and benefiting from record full year adjusted operating cash flows of $12.2 billion and the addition of the [ Wan Tai ] portfolio of approximately $7 million net to Chubb. In addition, we experienced unrealized gains on our portfolio during the year of $3.1 million which again highlights the transient nature of these mark-to-market movements for a high-quality fixed income portfolio.\nThis year, we continue to take advantage of an attractive interest rate environment, raising our portfolio yield to 4.3%, our highest since the third quarter of 2011. Our adjusted net investment income of $1.49 billion in the quarter included approximately $55 million of higher-than-normal dividend income and private equity distributions. Looking at it, we expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.45 billion and to go up from there.\nTurning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pretax catastrophe losses of $300 million, principally from weather-related events, split 54% in the U.S. and 46% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $323 million pretax, with 81% in short tail lines predominantly from property and 19% in long tail lines. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $146 million pretax, including $99 million asbestos related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 87%.\nOur reported effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the Bermuda review of deferred tax benefit mentioned earlier. Excluding the [indiscernible] benefit, our core operating effective tax rate would have been 17% for the quarter and 18.2% for the year, slightly below our guided range, reflecting higher income in some low tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of certain employee-related benefits due to rising equity markets. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for calendar 2024 to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions."

Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our September 30 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.com investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial statement supplement. And now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another outstanding quarter. Our performance was marked by double-digit global P&C premium growth, world-class P&C underwriting results including an [ 88:4 ] combined ratio, record net investment income and strong life operating income, all leading to record operating earnings per share. Once again, our premium revenue growth was well spread and broad-based with excellent results in our Commercial and Consumer businesses in both our North American and International operations.\nOur annualized core operating ROE was 13.5%, with a return on tangible equity of $21.2 million. Core operating income of $4.95 per share was up 58% over prior year. And for the first 9 months, we have produced record operating income of $5.9 billion or $14.27 per share, up 27.5%. In the quarter, our underwriting performance was driven by a combination of strong earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins, which included an ex-cat current accident year combined ratio of [ 84.3% or 83% ], excluding agriculture, favorable prior period reserve development in both North America and overseas general and relatively average cat losses compared to our expected P&C underwriting income of $1.3 billion was up almost 84%.\nOur positive reserve development speaks to the strength of our reserves and are reasonably cautious or conservative approach to reserving. As I've said for years, we generally strive to recognize bad news early that are slow to recognize good news. We're in a balance sheet business. Our loss reserves are the most important part of the liability side of our balance sheet. On the asset side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.4 billion was up $361 million or 34% over prior year. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% at the end of the third quarter versus 3.4% a year ago.\nWhile our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.2%. We have very strong liquidity, and our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. We are growing income without a change to our invested asset risk profile. In the quarter, we increased our ownership in Huatai Group to 69.6%, and now we're consolidating results, which were accretive to EPS and ROE. Earlier this month, we closed on additional shares, and our ownership stands now at over 72%. I expect this to increase further and reach between 83% and 86%. A summary of the financial impact of Huatai has provided for you in the earnings release and the financial supplement.\nPeter will have more to say about financial items, including cat, prior period, reserve development, investment income, book value, ROE and Huatai. Now turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 9% in the quarter. Made up of 8.4% growth in our P&C business globally and about 15% in our Life division. Global P&C premium growth, which excludes agriculture, was 12.3%, with Commercial Lines up almost [indiscernible] and Consumer Lines up about [ 17.5 ] a day. In agriculture, Crop premiums were lower than last year due to the timing of when we recognize them. Year-to-date premiums are, in fact, up modestly. As to the higher combined ratio in agriculture this quarter, we simply recognized a quarter earlier than last year, what we think is the likely development for the year based on what we know today about crop conditions and pricing.\nIn terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines in aggregate remains strong in the quarter in both North America and our International divisions, while decreases in financial lines in North America continued. We remain vigilant and diligent about staying on top of loss cost inflation. Beginning with North America. Commercial premiums, excluding Agriculture, were up 8.7%. P&C growth was 10.5%, excluding financial lines, which were up 1%. Our very large middle market division had its best quarter of the year with premium growth of 16.3% and middle market financial lines up 1.5%.\nOur major accounts and specialty division grew 7.2% with P&C up 84% and Financial Lines flat. Overall pricing for total North America Commercial increased 9.3%, including rate of 5.9% and exposure change that acts like rate of 3.2%. Let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing.\nPricing for Commercial Property & Casualty was up 13.9%. Property pricing was up 23% with rates up 16.6%, an exposure change of $5.5 million. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11%, with rates up 8.7% and exposure up 2%. Workers comp which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 5.5%, with rates essentially flat and exposure up 6%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.7%, same as last quarter. And again, that compares to pricing of 9.3%.\nIn general, we're trending loss costs in short-tail classes at 5.8%. And long tail, excluding workers' comp, loss costs are trending at 7.1%, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending at 4.7%. For Financial Lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O, rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America Financial Lines in aggregate were down 4.8% and 3.8%, respectively. We are trending Financial Lines loss costs at 4.7%. Renewal retention for our commercial businesses in North America was 92.7%, and our new business grew 14%.\nOn the consumer side, our high net worth personal lines business had another excellent quarter, with premiums up over 9.5% with rock strong retention and new business growth. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 15%, while our selected loss cost trend was similar to last quarter at 10.5%.\nTurning to our International General Insurance operations. Net premiums were up about 21.5%, and this includes a 7.5% contribution to growth from the Huatai consolidation. Our International Commercial business grew 17.5%, while Consumer was up 84%. In our International Retail business, growth was broad-based with all major regions reducing double-digit growth. Latin America led the way this quarter with premiums up 23%, made up of Commercial Lines growth of 16% and consumer up more than 28%.%\nEurope and Asia Pac had strong quarters with growth of 14.2% and 10.2%, respectively. We continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our International Commercial portfolio with pricing up 9.3%, rates up 5.7%, and exposure change of 3.4%. Property & Casualty lines, pricing was up 11.7%, with rates up 7.1% and exposure up 4.3%. While Financial Lines pricing was up 2.3%. Loss cost inflation across our International Commercial portfolio remained steady from last quarter. Trending at 6.6%.\nWithin our International Consumer, our A&H and Personal Lines divisions both had strong orders with premiums up 16.5% and over 40%, respectively. Personal Lines growth in Latin America rebounded sharply, with premiums up 43% on the back of growth, in our Mexican [indiscernible] portfolio, where we're taking significant rate actions to reflect the loss cost environment. In our International Life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums were up nearly 20%, including the impact of the Huatai consolidation. Life segment income was up nearly 15% to $288 million.\nIn summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to standing year-to-date results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way. Mindful of risk environment, and underwriting conditions, which are favorable in many areas of our business. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings globally. Which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C underwriting income, investment income, life income.\nI'm going to turn this call over to Peter, and then I'm going to come back and take the questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan, and good morning. First, I want to note that we completed our first quarter with Huatai Group as a consolidated subsidiary. The results of Huatai are reported at 100% within our financials, with only certain key metrics reported at the company's 69.6% ownership interest, including consolidated core operating and net income, book and tangible book value and ROE measures. Turning to our results.\nChubb reached 2 milestones this quarter. Invested assets reached $130 billion and adjusted net investment income topped $1.4 billion. Operating cash flow was a record $4.7 billion, reflecting our record investment income and strong premium collections. During the quarter, Moody's affirmed and moved our outlook from stable to positive, and as you know, S&P affirmed our group's rating with stable outlook earlier this year.\nCore operating ROE on a deployed capital basis is approximately 15.5% and the related operating return on tangible equity is approximately 27%. The book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.6% and 7% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, reflecting outstanding results for both periods. Tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, decreased 4.2% for the quarter with 7.5 percentage points coming from the dilutive impact of consolidating Huatai. With the consolidation on July 1, Chubb had additional goodwill and intangibles of $3.5 billion pretax.\nIn Q3, we've already earned back almost 2/3 of that amount and expect to earn back the rest within this current fourth quarter. Huatai had a modest impact on results this quarter, in line with expectations, adding $0.12 or 2.5% to core operating income per share, third of which related to the favorable impact of purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which will decline over the next year. As previously noted, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was a record $1.415 billion or $140 million above the top end of our guidance. Of which $100 million is related to Huatai, which was not included in our prior guidance.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to be approximately $1.435 billion to $1.45 billion on a recurring basis, including Huatai and to continue to grow from there. We remain consistent and conservative with our investments with 83% of our fixed income portfolio rated investment grade an overall average credit rating of. This quarter, we recognized an unrealized loss on our portfolio of $2.2 billion after tax, reflecting rising interest rates. We also recognized a modest favorable $18 million recovery of expected credit losses net of an immaterial impairment charge in the quarter, which attest to the overall quality of our portfolio.\nHuatai's investment assets added $12.7 billion gross or $6.4 billion attributable to Chubb to our investment portfolio. With over 2 decades as a strategic partner with Huatai, we have deep insight into Huatai's portfolio, and it fits well with our overall conservative approach to investing. 87% of Huatai's investment portfolio is fixed income related and is very high quality with an average credit rating of A, and with 98.5% rated investment grade.\nTurning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pretax catastrophe losses of $670 million, principally from weather-related events and wildfires in North America. Total catastrophe losses were split, 82% U.S. and 18% Internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $261 million pretax. The PPD in our active businesses this quarter consisted of $316 million favorable development in short tail lines and $55 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $61 million, principally related to environmental exposures. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 73% and was 84% through 9 months.\nThis quarter reflects the impact of strong premium growth on reserves, and the timing of our crop insurance payments. Our core operating effective income tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter which is within our guided range of 18.5% to 19% for this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.\n\nUnknown Analyst\n\nCongratulations on the quarter. My first question is actually on reserving. You obviously talked about recognizing bad news first and good news later. Curious about your thoughts on the recent developments. European reinsurers have talked more about the cautionary view on the U.S. casualty reserves. Social inflation has been around for years, but this is clearly something that European reinsurers are talking more about now.\nJust given their recent renewed caution, so to speak, on the U.S. casualty side. Are there any adverse trend that you're seeing across the industry that would justify this view? Any specific factors that you would like to call out? Curious about your view on this."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at Investors chubb.com. for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. As I mentioned on our last call, I'm coming to you this quarter from Singapore, our regional headquarters for Asia Pacific. The outlook in Asia for growth across our businesses, commercial P&C as well as consumer non-life and life, both short and long term is significant. The region is simply energizing. We have a large organization of talented executives and a strong diverse capability focused on the execution of a broad set of strategies throughout the region.\nAs you saw in our press release, we had a simply outstanding quarter. In fact, another record quarter performance with double-digit premium revenue and earnings growth as a result of world-class P&C underwriting results that produced an 85.4% combined ratio, record net investment income and a doubling of our life earnings. Our premium revenue growth was so well spread and broad-based, driven by outstanding double-digit growth in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses in both North America and internationally and over 100% growth in our Life business.\nOur annualized core operating ROE was 13.8%, with a return on tangible equity of 21%. Core operating income topped $2 billion, up 14% or 16.5% on a per share basis. Both were record results. For the first 6 months, we produced operating earnings of $3.9 billion or $9.32 per share, up 13 and 15.8%, respectively. Our underwriting performance resulted from a combination of strong premium growth, excellent current accident year margins with a combined ratio of 83.3% and favorable prior period reserve development, particularly in North America. On the investment side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up $290 million or 31% over prior year. Our portfolio yield is now 4% versus 3.2% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.8%.\nOur investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates and compound income without changing our risk profile. And then Life earnings doubled to $254 million, driven by our business in Asia, which is overwhelmingly supplemental A&H. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and ROE. Now turning to more color around growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased 16.1% in the quarter, on a published basis or 16.8% in constant dollars, made up of 10.5% growth in our P&C business globally and almost 130% in life premiums. Global P&C premium growth in the quarter was very well balanced and broad-based. In fact, our strongest quarter for growth since the third quarter of '21. North America, Asia Pac and Europe all produced double-digit growth. It's worth noting since 2019, we've grown our commercial P&C business by 50%.\nIn terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines were strong in the quarter in both North America and internationally, while financial lines globally continued to soften. We have been diligent about staying on top of loss cost, and our positive prior year reserve development reflects a steady conservative approach to reserving. Beginning with North America. Commercial premiums, excluding ag, were up 10.5%. P&C growth was 14%, excluding financial lines, while financial lines premiums decreased, reflecting a disciplined response to the underwriting environment.\nTotal premium in our E&S business, the Westchester grew 12% while our major accounts division grew 14% or 11% excluding loss portfolio transfers. In our middle market division, premiums were up 5% with P&C growth of 9 our middle-market workers' comp book was flat and Financial Lines premiums in middle market declined about 1.5%. Overall pricing for total North America commercial lines increased 12.8%, including rate of 8.7% and exposure change of 3.8%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty excluding financial lines, was up 17.7%.\nWe are trending loss costs in North America at 6.7%, and it varies by line. In general, we are trending loss costs in short-tail classes at 5.8 in long tail, excluding comp, loss costs are trending at 7.3%, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending at 4.7%. Let me provide a bit more color around rate and growth. Property pricing was up 31.5%, with rates up 22%, an exposure change of 7.8%. Major accounts and E&S property together grew premiums over 40% in the quarter, while middle-market property grew 11.4%.\nCasualty pricing in North America was up 11.3%, with rates up almost 9% and exposure up 2.2%. We grew casualty in the quarter, 8%. In workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up just over 5%, with rates up 5% and exposure up 4% primary workers' comp premiums declined 2.9% in the quarter. For financial lines, the competitive environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O and rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines in aggregate were down about 4.5%. Our fin lines book shrank $3.7 million Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was very strong at 98.5%.\nOn the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another strong quarter, with premiums up almost 11%. Our growth was balanced across a broad range of geographies and our retention was very strong at 104% on a premium basis and over 90% on an account basis. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 14.7%, while the homeowners' loss cost trend remained steady at 10.5% there is a lot of attention placed on consumer auto experience. So I thought I would comment briefly on it. For us, auto was a small part of our high net worth business. And you may have noticed that we had a modest reserve release in our prior year's reserves for our North America Personal Lines segment in the quarter.\nThis release was primarily in auto, and we are comfortable with our reserves and loss picks for auto. Turning to our international general insurance operations, net premiums were up 11% in constant dollar or 9.3% after FX. Our international commercial business grew 12%. Consumer was up 9.5%. Our international retail business grew over 10.5%, while our London wholesale business grew about 14%. In our international retail business growth was led by Asia Pacific with premiums up 17.5%, made up of commercial lines growth of over 12% and consumer P&C up more than 23%.\nEurope produced overall growth of 10.5% with the continent up more than 12%. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across international commercial portfolios. Our retail business pricing was up 8.9%, with rates up 5% and exposure change of 3.7% while loss costs across our international commercial portfolio are trending at 6.6%. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter with premiums up over 16%. In Asia, our A&H business grew 31%, driven by our direct marketing and travel insurance business and the consolidation of Cigna Thailand.\nIn the U.K. and Europe, A&H premiums were up 11.5%. And in our International Life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums tripled to over $1 billion. Since I'm here, I want to conclude with a bit more about operations in Asia, which have very strong growth and momentum across our businesses, both consumer non-life and life and commercial P&C. We have significant opportunity for growth, both short and long term in a broad variety of markets across a broad range of customers and distribution channels. Our total premium in the region is about $9 billion and well balanced with half non-life split 50-50, consumer and commercial and the other half life.\nOur overall presence and capabilities in North, Southeast Asia and Australia are spread across 11 markets with distinct and significant areas of growth opportunity in each. Across the region, we have a broad range of product capabilities focused on different customer segments with varied and meaningful distribution strength, including a diverse and growing list of partnerships with financial institutions and e-commerce leaders that give us access to hundreds of millions of consumers. We have strong digital capabilities and a fast-growing digital insurance business, encompassing more of our products.\nWe are the largest direct marketers of insurance, mostly A&H products to consumers in Asia through both non-life and life companies that are unifying to offer more products to more customers. From a macro perspective, the region is so dynamic and vast with the diversity of cultures and large economies some with large young populations, some with large aging populations that have a different set of needs. Broadly speaking in Asia, there is an innovation-oriented mindset, a strong work ethic and a deep dynamism. Supply chains and capital flows are growing deeper across the region. There is a growing infrastructure investment. As a result, regional commerce and trade is growing and becoming more connected between Southeast Asia, North Asia, India and Australia.\nThere is a lot to be optimistic about. In summary, we are having an outstanding year with record quarterly and first half financial results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way and underwriting conditions are favorable in a lot of areas of our business. We have a lot of momentum heading into the second half. And as I look ahead, we again are confident in our ability to continue this pattern of growth in revenue and earnings and in turn, drive double-digit EPS growth.\nI'm going to turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan. And good morning. As you've just heard, Chubb delivered another quarter of strong underwriting and investment performance, leading to record results, which generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow this quarter and $4.8 billion through the first half of the year. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $724 million in share repurchases at an average price of $197.04 per share and $354 million in dividends.\nBook value and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively, for the quarter and 4.3% and 6.5%, respectively, through the first half of the year, reflecting record core operating income net of the capital returned to shareholders noted earlier. In addition to the quarterly ROEs Evan just gave you, our year-to-date core operating ROE and return on tangible equity of 3.2% and 20.2%, respectively, exceed the target range Evan has laid out in the past. Adjusted net investment income from the quarter was $1.24 billion or $20 million above the top end of our guidance, primarily from higher private equity income. The increase over last year of 30% was driven by strong cash flow, our accelerated portfolio turnover and higher reinvestment rates.\nIn the third quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to rise from $1.24 billion this quarter to around $1.27 billion on a recurring basis and to continue to grow from there. Relative to our invested assets, we continue to tactically execute our portfolio turnover strategy while maintaining a conservative credit posture. During the quarter, we reclassified our $8 billion held-to-maturity portfolio to available for sale to have even more flexibility to put money to work at higher yields.\nThese securities had $397 million after tax of net unrealized losses that reduced book value at the time of the change. It's important to note that the transfer itself has no economic impact as the underlying securities remained unchanged and are of a very high quality with an average rating of AA. We will look to sell parts of this portfolio only where and when we think it makes economic sense and not all of the unrealized loss will become realized. Turning to our underwriting business. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $400 million, principally from weather-related events in the U.S. prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $260 million pretax, which was split about evenly between short tail and long tail lines and included $146 million for North American commercial and $61 million for Overseas General.\nOur corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $60 million, principally related to molestation claim development. As I noted, the PPD and overseas general for the quarter was $61 million versus $173 million last year. The larger favorable PPD in the quarter last year was concentrated in the 2020 accident year and included favorable development from COVID-related economic shutdowns. The year-to-date favorable PPD for Overseas General was $204 million, comparable to last year's $233 million and $181 million in 2021, all in short tail lines for these years.\nOur paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 89% or 83% after adjusting for cats and PPD. Turning to our Life segment year-over-year segment income growth came primarily from the acquisition of Cigna. Our core operating effective income tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is at the top end of our guided range of 18% to 19%. We now expect our annual operating effective tax rate for 2023 to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%, excluding the impact of consolidating Huatai. On July 1, we completed the acquisition of additional shares of Huatai Group increasing our aggregate ownership to 69.6%.\nWe expect the closing of additional shares this quarter, which will bring our ownership up to 83.2%. Beginning in Q3, we will consolidate Huatai's results within our financials. We currently estimate consolidation will result in a small amount of accretion to operating income and EPS book value and ROE and a modest amount of dilution to tangible book value, which we estimate will recover within the next few quarters. However, I would note, we are still working through our purchase accounting analysis. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.\n\nThank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Greenberg\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Chubb Ltd.\n\nGood morning. We had an excellent start to the year, highlighted by double-digit operating earnings growth that led to record results. We had double-digit premium revenue growth that was global, broad-based and driven by strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses and our International Life business. World-class underwriting results with an 86.3% combined ratio, record net investment income and life income that more than doubled. North America P&C rate and price increases reaccelerated in the quarter, it was in word standout performance that I expect will continue.\nWe grew operating income almost 12% to $1.8 billion, and that drove a 15% increase to $4.41 per share, both records. In context, of what was an active CAT quarter. Our published combined ratio reflects simply outstanding underwriting performance from our P&C businesses. The 83.4% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio was a record.\nOn the Investment income side, Record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up over 30%. Our portfolio yield is now 3.8% versus 3% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.5%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates.\nLife Insurance premium revenue more than doubled, while Life earnings doubled to $244 million, driven by our business in Asia and predominantly the addition of the Cigna operations which are mostly A&H and product makeup.\nIn this time of economic and financial market volatility and uncertainty, Chubb is a safe haven. Our business model and the fundamentals of our business are very strong and broad-based. Our earnings and revenue are growing. We have an exceptionally strong capital position and a conservative level of leverage and our operating cash flow of $11 billion in '22 and over $2.25 billion this quarter speaks to our strong liquidity. Our unrealized loss as a percentage of tangible equity is 17% and will amortize back to par over a short period. Rising interest rates are our friend and most important, as you know, you can have a run on the bank in our business. So again, this speaks to an attractive profile that distinguishes Chubb.\nPeter is going to have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and a rising ROE.\nNow turning to growth and the pricing and rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 16.5% in the quarter on a published basis or over 18% in constant dollars, comprised of 11% growth in our P&C business globally and 129% growth in life premiums. P&C premium growth in the quarter was balanced and broad-based. North America, Europe and Asia, all produced double-digit growth.\nBeginning with North America, commercial premiums were up almost 12% or 6.2% excluding Agriculture. Adjusted for the impact of one-off loss portfolio transfers in our major accounts division, year-over-year North America regular commercial flow grew 7.6%, which is representative of the minimum rate growth we expect for the balance of the year. And by the way, the 7.6% is broken down as 10% growth in P&C and minus 2% growth in financial lines.\nOur major accounts and specialty division grew 6.3% or 8.7% adjusted for the LPTs. And that was 11.4% P&C and minus 7% financial lines. In our middle market and small commercial business, premiums were up 6.5% or 7% in P&C and up 2% in financial lines. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was 97%.\nOn the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business was up almost 10%, an exceptionally strong result. And in fact, the strongest organic growth in over 15 years.\nTurning to our International General Insurance operations, net premiums were up 10% in constant dollars or 6% after FX impact with commercial up 10.8% and consumer up over 8.5%. Growth was led by our Asia Pacific region with premiums up over 18.5%. And with commercial lines up about 15% and consumer lines up over 22%. And Europe produced overall growth of over 10%.\nIn terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, rate and price increases reaccelerated. Pricing for total North America Commercial P&C, which includes rate of 6.4% and exposure change of 4.5% increased 11.2% against a loss cost trend of 6.7%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty, excluding financial lines and workers' comp was up 16.9%. Property pricing was up 27%, with rates up 16.4% and exposure change of 9.1%. Casualty pricing was up 9.9%, which includes 7.4% of rate and 2.3% of exposure.\nAs I said last quarter, for professional lines and workers' comp, which includes risk management, the competitive environment is aggressive and rates have continued to decline in recognition of favorable experience. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America, financial lines and aggregate were down about 2% and in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and risk management, pricing was up [ 6.4% ], with rates down 0.5% and exposure up about [ 6.8% ].\nInternationally, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, pricing was up about 8%, with rates up 4.8%, and exposure change of about 2.9%. While loss costs across our international commercial portfolio, or trending at 6.5%.\nTurning to our Consumer businesses. In North America, high net worth personal lines business, again, net written premiums were up almost 10%. With our true high net worth client segment, up over 15%. Retentions were 104% on a premium basis and about 91% or on an account basis. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capacity.\nIn our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 13%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. International consumer lines premiums again grew over 8.5% in the quarter in constant dollars. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter, with premiums up about 20%. Asia Pacific was up 34.5% while the U.K. was up over 12%. Premiums in our international personal lines business were down 1.5 points, and it was impacted by our business in Europe.\nIn our International Life Insurance business, again, premiums and income overall more than doubled. Our business in Korea and the majority of Asia is off to a good start to the year. I was just in Korea 2 weeks ago, our leadership, the franchise, the strategy, the execution and the growth are all in really good shape. And this is a very large business for Chubb.\nIn summary, we had an excellent quarter and have had a strong start to the year with a lot of momentum heading into the second quarter. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings, which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C: underwriting income, investment income and life income. Add to that our business model, financial strength, stability and liquidity, and I believe you have in Chubb, both the reassurance of safety, and the attractive prospects of a long-term growth company.\nI'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter Enns\n\nThank you, Evan, and good morning.\nBefore we begin, I want to note that previously reported numbers in the financial supplement we just filed were adjusted to reflect the impact from the adoption of LDTI accounting, which primarily relates to our Life Insurance business. The cumulative impact of LDTI on our book value and overall results is immaterial. Please refer to Page 31 of the financial supplement for detailed information.\nTurning to our first quarter results. As you've just heard, we are starting out the year an exceptionally strong financial position. Our P&C divisions, expanding life business and strong investment performance produced operating cash flow of $2.3 billion. We grew our assets to over $200 billion, and this includes invested assets of about $116 billion that continued to benefit from the current rate environment and generated our fourth consecutive quarter of record net investment income.\nI would note S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed our AA ratings and stable outlook, reflecting our strong financial position.\nRelative to capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $772 million to shareholders, including $428 million in share repurchases at an average price of $212.81 per share and $344 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share increased 5% and 8.7%, respectively, from last quarter. The increase reflects our record core operating income and net realized and unrealized gains of $1.7 billion in the investment portfolio, partially offset by the capital return to shareholders I already mentioned.\nOur core operating ROE for the quarter was 12.6%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 19.4%. A year ago, Evan stated our target for 2023 core operating ROE, excluding excess capital or on a deployed capital basis to be 13% and core operating return on tangible equity to be 20%. In this first quarter of 2023, we estimate the deployed capital ROE results to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% and 23% to 23.5%, respectively.\nAdjusted net investment income for the quarter was $1.2 billion and topped last year's record quarter -- last quarter's record by over 7%, reflecting higher reinvestment rates that impact recurring income as well as certain items totaling approximately $35 million, including higher-than-expected private equity distributions that vary from quarter-to-quarter. We now expect our adjusted net investment income on a recurring basis to rise from this quarter's $1.165 billion to $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion next quarter and we expect it to continue to rise from there for the remainder of the year given our positive cash flows, portfolio turnover and the current reinvestment rate environment.\nLet me make a few more comments on investments given recent economic and market events. We continue to maintain our consistent conservative approach to our investment process and our portfolio remains high quality with an average rate A rating. Our overall exposure to banks is 8% of invested assets with 2/3 of that -- 2/3 of that in G-SIFIs. We have no exposure to Silicon Valley Signature or First Republic Banks. We have no exposure to Credit Suisse contingent capital securities and do not invest in Tier 1 bank CoCos as an investment policy.\nOur exposure to regional banks is less than 1% of our portfolio and is in high-quality names. Our total direct exposure to commercial real estate is 4% of invested assets and 87% of that total is in investment-grade securities with an average rating of AA. This portfolio is skewed to multifamily and industrial sectors with under 20% related to the commercial office segment. High-yield credit is currently 14% of our portfolio and is targeted to the upper tier of the high-yield market, rated BBB with a current average rating of B+ broadly diversified with over 900 issuers and mandated to outperform in down markets.\nBack to our underwriting business. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $458 million split 76% in the U.S. and 24% internationally. In the U.S., the loss activity consisted of winter-related storms and other severe weather events. Internationally, results were primarily impacted by storms in New Zealand and Australia. Prior period development in the quarter was a favorable $196 million. Included in that total is adverse development of $6 million related to the 2022 accident year cat losses comprised of $119 million adverse development from Winter storm Elliott, and $113 million favorable from Hurricane Ian.\nExcluding cat-related development, we had favorable development of $202 million across all lines, commercial and consumer, with $228 million favorable related to short tail lines and an adverse development of $26 million in long tail lines, $10 million of which was from corporate runoff lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 92% or 82% after adjusting for cats prior period development and a large payment related to the Boy Scouts of America settlement. Our core operating effective tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter at the low end of our expected annual range.\nI would highlight the first quarter often has a lower tax rate than the full year, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for this year to be in the range of 18% to 19%.\nLastly, relative to Wan Tai, we closed on some of our outstanding shares during the quarter, which brought our ownership interest to 64%. We continue to apply equity accounting for the first quarter, and we'll consolidate Wan Tai once we go over 2/3 ownership, which we think will likely occur in the second quarter when we anticipate exceeding 80%.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren Beyer\n\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nKaren Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our December 31, 2022, Fourth Quarter and Year-end Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplements.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. We had a strong finish, which contributed to another record year. Our quarterly underwriting results were excellent, with an 88% combined ratio despite a true-up to the projected '22 crop insurance full year results. We had good growth in net investment income that led to a record result, and double-digit premium growth with strong contributions from our commercial and consumer P&C lines globally and our International Life business.\nMore important, the quarterly results led to what was the best full year financial performance in our company's history, including record operating income on both a per share and dollar basis from record P&C underwriting and investment income and another year of double-digit premium revenue growth, including the best organic growth in our international P&C business in a decade. All areas of the company contributed to the outstanding results last year, and I want to congratulate and thank so many of my colleagues around the globe.\nCore operating income in the quarter was $1.7 billion or $4.05 per share. Crop results reduced our expected Agriculture earnings by $0.39 per share. For the year, we produced core operating income of $6.5 billion or $15.24 per share, up 21% and again, a record. Quarterly P&C underwriting income of $1.1 billion was impacted, as I said, by an underwriting loss from crop as we trued-up our projection for the '22 crop year. This change of view for the full year result was due to the late season emergence of losses from drought conditions in certain Corn Belt states, which overshadowed average to excellent growing conditions in many other areas, leading to what we now know is a below-average year overall for that business.\nAgriculture is a weather exposed business with Nat-Cat like characteristics. It's about growing conditions and commodity prices. And each year, you start over. For the year, we performed well, all considered. We published a 94.2% combined ratio and produced $165 million in agriculture underwriting income. Back on the quarter, excluding agriculture, the combined ratio was 85.9% and speaks to the strong broad-based underlying performance of our business, which produced an amazing 82.9% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio. Full year P&C underwriting income was a record $4.6 billion, up 23% with a published combined ratio of 87.6%, and that's with $2.2 billion of catastrophe losses in what was one of the costliest years yet for the industry in terms of cats.\nOn the investment side, adjusted net investment income topped $1.1 billion for the quarter, up about $215 million from prior year and $4 billion for the year, both records. Our reinvestment rate is now averaging 5.6% against a portfolio yield of 3.6%, and that's translating into annualized run rate growth simply going into the first quarter of 13%, which will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates. Our operating cash flow for the quarter and year was $2.7 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively.\nFor perspective, I want to touch on capital management. As you know, our policy is to maintain - is to manage for capital flexibility. After all, we are a balance sheet business in the risk business, and we are a growth company. We maintain flexibility for risk and opportunity and return the balance to shareholders, simple and consistent policy. The last 2 years are instructive. We have organically grown our P&C premiums 21.5%, and that requires capital. We have deployed $5.4 billion for the Cigna acquisition and invested a further $1.4 billion in increasing our Huatai ownership, together key strategic acquisitions with an emphasis on Asia. And at the same time, we have returned over $10.5 billion of total capital to shareholders through buybacks (over 9% of outstanding shares) and dividends, all the while maintaining capital adequacy for risk and future opportunity, and we have capital flexibility given our strong earnings generation power. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value, and ROE.\nNow turning to growth in the rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased nearly 12% in the quarter on a published basis, or 16% in constant dollars, to $10.2 billion. This includes growth of 9.8% in our P&C business and over 100% of growth in Life premiums, reflecting the addition of the Cigna Asia business. P&C premium growth in earnings in the quarter were balanced and broad-based with contributions from virtually all commercial and most consumer businesses globally. Agriculture aside, North America Commercial premiums were up almost 9%, while our high net worth Personal lines business was up 6%, a very strong result. Overseas General grew 9.7% in constant dollars, but declined 1.3% after FX, with commercial up 9.4% and consumer up 10.3%.\nWe are a major multinational company and are impacted by currency movements. After reaching a 20-year high in September, the dollar has been weakening, and that will benefit our growth in the future. In North America, growth this quarter in commercial lines was led by our Major accounts and specialty division, which grew 9.1%, followed by our Middle Market and Small Commercial business, which grew 8.7%. And renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was over 96%. In our international general insurance operations, retail commercial P&C grew 9% in constant dollars, while our London wholesale business grew about 7.5%. Retail commercial growth was led by Latin America, with premiums up nearly 13%, followed by growth of 8.5% in AsiaPac and 6.5% in our UK/ Ireland division.\nIn terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, pricing conditions remain favorable for most lines of business. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable, risk-adjusted returns. So, like I said last quarter, in most lines, additional rate is required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which again are hardly benign in both long-tail and short-tail lines. To illustrate, in the quarter, pricing for total North America Commercial P&C, which includes both rate and the portion of exposure that supports rate, increased 6.5%, with loss costs up 6.5% as well.\nNow that's the headline. And let's drill down further because I think it's more insightful. Pricing for Commercial P&C, excluding Financial Lines and Workers' Comp was up 10%, with loss costs trending 6.9%. Breaking P&C down a step further, property pricing is firming in response to catastrophe exposures, inflation, reinsurance pricing, and availability. Short-tail pricing was up 14.7%, while loss costs were up 6.8%. Property insurance is an opportunity for us. For the majority of casualty lines, pricing is adequate. In the quarter, pricing for North America casualty was up 7.5%, while loss cost trends were 6.9%.\nNow given casualty loss cost trends, rates in most classes need to rise at an accelerated pace. There is little to no room for forgiveness and here a special mention to excess casualty and auto-related liability is warranted. For Chubb, our minds are clear, and our playbook is consistent. In some lines like professional liability and workers' comp, which includes risk management, the competitive environment is quite aggressive, and rates have been falling for a number of quarters now in recognition of favorable pricing and favorable experience. However, if not careful, the market is in danger of overshooting the mark.\nIn the quarter, rates and pricing for North America Financial Lines in aggregate were essentially flat. They were up 0.2%, while loss cost trends were up 5%. And in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and risk management, pricing was up 2.3% against a loss cost trend of 5.5%. Internationally, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our International Retail business, pricing was up about 9.5%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region and loss costs are trending 6.2%.\nTurning to our consumer businesses. In our North America high net worth Personal Lines business, again, net written premiums were up about 6%. Our true high net worth client segment, however, grew 12.5%. There is a flight to quality and capacity. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 12.5%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. International consumer lines premiums grew over 10% in the quarter, again, in constant dollars. Our International A&H division had another strong quarter, with premiums up about 21%. AsiaPac was up nearly 40%, with half of the growth coming from the Cigna acquisition, while Latin America and the U.K. each were up about 13.5%.\nPremiums in our international personal lines business were up less than 1% in constant dollars. In our international Life Insurance business, premiums doubled in constant dollars, while life income overall was also up over 100%, both positively impacted by the addition of the Cigna Asia business, which is on track. As we enter '23, while early days, growth in our Asia consumer business, including non-Life, Life, and A&H is widespread and strong - a combination of a strong external environment and our capabilities and presence. Consumer lending, increasing foot traffic across retail and banking operations, and the resurgence of leisure and business travel are all contributing to strong growth. Leisure travel alone was up nearly 400% over prior year. And as China reopens from its strict pandemic controls, it will further stimulate growth in the region. Think trade, which benefits commercial lines and business travel, and think tourist travel as the Chinese begin to travel again on holiday. As regards China, as you know, last quarter, we received regulatory approval to increase our ownership in Huatai Insurance Group to 83.2%. Since then, the transfer of shares from a number of separate shareholders has taken place, and we've increased our ownership to 64%. The remaining 19% is expected to close in the next weeks or months.\nIn summary, we had an outstanding year. And looking ahead, we are starting off on a strong foot in the first quarter overall. Conditions remain favorable in terms of continued growth for our businesses globally and then add the strong trajectory of growth from investment income. Despite the challenging macro environment, I am quite optimistic about our future and confident in our ability to outperform.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan, and good morning. As you've just heard, we continue to deliver strong underlying business and investment performance in the fourth quarter, leading to another year of record results. Book value and tangible book value per share increased 6.2% and 9.5%, respectively, since September. The increase reflects strong operating results, $544 million in dividends and share repurchases as well as net realized and unrealized gains of $1.6 billion after tax, including $1.3 billion in the fixed income portfolio from declining interest rates and foreign currency translation gains of $594 million. This quarter's mark-to-market investment gains followed prior quarter's losses from a rising rate environment, reinforcing our view that these fluctuations in valuation, particularly on a high-quality fixed income portfolio are largely transient and don't represent real economics for a buy and hold insurance company like Chubb.\nFor the full year, book and tangible book value per share decreased 12.9% and 23.5%, whereas excluding AOCI, they increased 5.3% and 3.0%, respectively, including the dilutive impact on tangible equity of the Cigna acquisition. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 18.6% and 17.2%, respectively, while our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 11.9% and 11.2%.\nTurning to investments, adjusted net investment income for the quarter of over $1.1 billion topped last quarter's record by more than 6% and was 24% higher than the prior year quarter. We anticipate this to continue to increase in 2023 through portfolio growth and a continuing attractive rate environment. And as such, we expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to now be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.155 billion. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $400 million, principally from winter storm Elliott. There were other weather-related events in the quarter, offset by changes from prior quarter's cats. However, there was no change in our aggregate Hurricane Ian estimate. Catastrophe and crop insurance underwriting losses together added 6.6 percentage points to our P&C combined ratio.\nWe had favorable prior period development in our active companies in the quarter of $254 million, mainly in the short tail lines, primarily from Commercial P&C Lines of Property, Marine, and Agriculture from 2020 and 2021 accident years. In addition, there was adverse development of $87 million in our legacy runoff exposures, including $62 million related to asbestos, which was recognized as part of our annual reserve review. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 102%, of which about 8 percentage points related specifically to payments in our crop insurance program, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter each year. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 85%, excluding crops, cats, and PPD.\nInternational Life Insurance segment income post the Cigna acquisition is as expected, except for an adverse non-recurring $52 million adjustment in the quarter related to Huatai, the company's partially owned insurance entity. This adjustment was to better align our accounting policies and procedures. In addition, the Life Insurance segment in total benefited from a reserve release of $60 million in the quarter related to our Combined North America business. Our core operating effective tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with previously guided range. Our expected annual core operating effective tax rate for 2023, we expect to be in the range of 18% to 19%.\nOn a final note, Chubb is adopting long duration targeted improvement accounting guidance or LDTI, as of January 1, 2023. This changes the accounting for long-duration contracts, which relates to our Life Insurance businesses. And this is an accounting change only, having no impact on the underlying economics. In the 10-K, we will disclose the historical book value impact as of 1 and 2 years ago. But as of year-end '22, we expect a net favorable but immaterial impact to book value.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you. And at this time, we're happy to take your questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt's now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, everyone, and welcome to our September 30, 2022, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter in spite of CAT losses with terrific underwriting results, including outstanding combined ratios, record net investment income, double-digit constant dollar P&C premium growth, well balanced between commercial and consumer, and finally, surging Life division revenue growth with the addition of Cigna's Asia business. Commercial P&C pricing was strong and exceeded loss costs in aggregate and in most individual lines of business.\nCore operating income in the quarter was $1.3 billion, or $3.17 per share, up 20% over prior. In the quarter, we produced $710 million of underwriting income, up 15% with a published combined ratio of 93.1%. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $1.2 billion, of which $975 million was Ian.\nFor the year, record underwriting income of $3.4 billion was up more than 40% or $1 billion leading to an 87.5% combined ratio, an improvement of nearly 3 points over prior year. Underpinning the published combined ratio was the ex-cat current accident year combined ratio, which was 84% for the quarter, adding to a record 83.7% for the year, simply stunning.\nHurricane Ian was a large event distinguished by its size, wind speed and amount of water, both surge and flood. The models we use contemplate a CAT 3 or greater event striking Florida about every 3 years. We are fully prepared to take CAT risk and the associated volatility. After all, it's what we do for a living. As long as we are adequately compensated and the concentration of exposure is within our balance sheet wherewithal. In my judgment, current pricing for CAT is inadequate in many portfolios, and property pricing should continue to adjust to the realities of the Nat Cat environment, as well as the increased costs for reinsurance protection and potential lack of availability.\nReturning to the quarter. Investment income was a record $1.1 billion, up over 12% from prior year, topping $1 billion for the first time. As I noted on our recent calls, with rising interest rates and widening spreads, investment income is and will continue to rise. Our reinvestment rate is now averaging 5.8% against a portfolio yield of 3.4%. During the quarter, we continued to accelerate the turnover of our portfolio in a targeted way so that we could put cash to work more quickly at higher yields. Investment income will make up a growing percentage of our company's earnings as we look forward. Obviously, rising rates have produced a sizable negative mark on our invested asset. But as a reminder, we are a buy and hold fixed income investor and the mark is transitory. To put a point on that, our portfolio credit quality is high, and we expect about half of the mark will accrete back to book value over about a 2-year period.\nAs you saw, the addition of Cigna's business in Asia, which we closed in the quarter is making an immediate contribution to revenue and earnings in line with what we expected. It is accretive to our consolidated results, including operating income and ROE. Peter will provide more information around the financial items.\nTurning to growth and the rate environment. Total P&C net written premiums globally increased 8.5% in the quarter on a published basis or 11.2% in constant dollars, with commercial up 11.7% and consumer up over 9.5%. Consolidated net premiums for the company, which include our Life Insurance segment increased 17.3% in constant dollars, reflecting the consolidation of the Cigna Asia business. P&C premium growth and earnings in the quarter were again balanced and broad-based with contributions from virtually all our commercial businesses globally. Total North America premiums were up over 10.5% with commercial up 11.4% or 8.1% excluding agriculture, and our high net worth personal lines business up over 7% in the quarter. Overseas General grew 11.7% in constant dollars, but only 2% after FX, with commercial up 11% and consumer up 12.7%. With the strongest USD in 20 years, the negative impact of FX masked the real strength of our business.\nAgriculture premiums were up nearly 22% in the quarter, driven overwhelmingly by crop insurance growth as a result of commodity price increases and market share gains, we produced near record underwriting income off the back of what we project to be a decent growing season.\nIn terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market conditions remain quite favorable for most lines of business. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns. So additional rate is required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which as I have been saying, are hardly benign in both long-tail and short-tail lines. The market is reasonably disciplined. But given loss cost inflation, and what will be slowing growth in exposure in the future given economic conditions, casualty rates in most classes will need to rise at an accelerated rate or else the industry will fail to keep pace.\nIn North America, growth this quarter in Commercial Lines was led by our major accounts and specialty division, which grew 9.7%, followed by our Middle Market and Small Commercial business, which grew 5.7%. In our Middle Market division, P&C lines grew almost 9%, while Financial Lines declined about 5.5%, primarily due to a lack of IPOs, M&A activity and new business. Renewal retention for our Retail Commercial businesses was virtually 100% on a premium basis.\nOverall rates in North America Commercial Lines, excluding comp, were up 5%, while total pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 8.5%. We are staying on top of inflation in terms of pricing and reserving. In North America Commercial Lines, we assume loss cost trends of 6.5%, the same as the second quarter.\nIn major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased 5.3% with pricing up 8.6%. General casualty rates were up 8.7%. Property rates were up 9.7% and financial lines rates were up 4.3%.\nIn our E&S wholesale business, rates increased 9%, with pricing up nearly 13%. Property rates were up about 11.5%. Casualty rates were up 8.5%, and Financial Lines rates were up almost 9%. In our Middle Market business, rates increased 4.2%, excluding comp, with pricing up about 6.5%. Rates for property were up over 6% and pricing was up double digit. Casualty rates were up 6.5%, with pricing up over 8% and comp rates were down 3.8%. However, comp pricing was up 6.5%. Financial Lines rates were up just over 1%, with pricing up about 2%.\nOur North America high net worth personal lines business had a very good quarter, with net premiums up over 7%, driven by strong new business activity. Our true high net worth client segments grew 12.5%, while overall retention was very strong at over 98%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 11%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%.\nTurning to our International General Insurance operations. In constant dollars, if you haven't noticed, 2022 is the best organic growth we have experienced in nearly a decade. In the quarter, retail commercial P&C premiums grew 12.3%, while London wholesale grew over 9.5%. Retail commercial growth was led by Latin America with premiums up 23.5%, followed by growth of nearly 15.5% in Asia Pacific and over 10% in our U.K. and Europe division. Internationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio.\nIn our International Retail business, rates increased in the quarter 9%. While we estimate pricing was up about 12%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region.\nOutside North America, we are currently trending loss costs at about 6.5%. Again, similar to the second quarter, though that varies by class of business and country. Like in North America, these trend factors are contemplated in both our reserving and in our accident year loss picks.\nInternational consumer lines growth in the quarter picked up considerable momentum with premiums up over 13%, though FX scrubbed about 11.5 points off the growth. Our international A&H division had an exceptionally strong quarter. Premiums grew over 22.5% in constant dollars, with Asia Pac up over 34%, the U.K. up over 26% and Latin America up 17%.\nOur International Personal Lines business grew more modestly in the quarter, with premiums up 4.5% in constant dollars. Premiums in Chubb life were up 117% in constant dollars and impacted heavily by the Cigna acquisition. Cigna's operation contributed about $740 million in net premiums written and $160 million in income to the Life segment this quarter. We have hit the ground running in terms of integration and execution of our growth strategies in Asia.\nSo to sum it all up, all of our businesses across the globe contributed to growth and earnings in the quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. We are operating in a challenging economic environment, given inflation, the specter of recession and financial market volatility as well as the geopolitical environment and the evolving risks from climate change. Despite all of that, looking forward, we are quite bullish on the future, given our growth and exceptional underwriting margins in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses, the strong trajectory for investment income and the contributions from the Cigna acquisition to our growing Asia Life business. We expect EPS to continue to grow at a healthy rate into the future.\nI'll turn the call over to Peter and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan. Good morning. Our strong underlying business performance continued in the third quarter, producing operating cash flow of $3.4 billion and contributing to a record $8.6 billion through 9 months. We remain in a position of exceptional financial strength with over $63 billion in total capital and strong liquidity with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion at quarter end, and this is after paying $5.4 billion cash for the Cigna business on July 1.\nAmong the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, including $685 million in share repurchases at an average price of $186.22 and $346 million in dividends. Tangible book value per share decreased 15.2% since June, reflecting changes in AOCI, which includes realized and unrealized losses of $3.6 billion after tax, resulting from rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio and foreign currency translation losses of $466 million. Additionally, the increased goodwill and intangibles of $1.5 billion related to the Cigna acquisition represented 370 basis points of the decrease. Excluding AOCI and Cigna, the tangible book value per share increased 0.4% since last quarter. We continue to expect to recover the Cigna dilution within 6 months, as we said when we announced the acquisition.\nBook value per share declined 7% for the quarter, reflecting the same AOCI factors. As you saw, the addition of Cigna's A&H and Life businesses in Asia are making an immediate contribution in line with what we expected. For the quarter, the acquisition contributed 7% accretion to operating EPS, 50 basis points to our annualized core operating ROE of 9.4% and 110 basis points to our tangible ROE of 14.4%. Our integration efforts are progressing well, and we are on track with expected expense synergies and net integration costs, as we previously announced. Almost all of Cigna's businesses are part of our Life segment. And going forward, we will not report on a stand-alone basis.\nWe remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy with 82% of our fixed income portfolio rated investment grade and do not contemplate any major change to our current asset allocation. The Cigna portfolio of approximately $4.3 billion is also of high quality with an average credit rating of A+ and 96% of the fixed-income portfolio rated investment grade. As Evan noted, as rates continue to rise, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased from 2.3% in December to 5.8% on September 30, while our current book yield is 3.4% versus 3.2% in the second quarter.\nWith market rates above our book yield, we have tactically taken advantage of opportunities to increase the portfolio's yield. We have been selectively utilizing gains from equity-related investments and interest rate hedges to fund turning over parts of the fixed income portfolio in this higher rate environment. This, along with the normal turnover of our portfolio, the addition of Cigna's investments as well as certain other items contributed to adjusted net investment income of $1 billion fifty million in the quarter.\nUpdating our quarterly guidance, we now expect adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1 billion forty million to $1 billion sixty million.\nRelative to Hurricane Ian, approximately 77% of the pretax catastrophe losses were incurred in commercial lines, 23% in personal lines. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $222 million pretax or $162 million after tax. This is net of $73 million pretax adverse development from our legacy runoff exposures, principally environmental related. The remaining favorable development of $295 million is split approximately 11% long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2018 and prior and 89% in short-tail lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 75% or 79% after adjusting for CATs and PPD.\nOur core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%, which is above the high end of our previously announced annual range of 16.5% to 18.5%. This is primarily due to the Cigna acquisition and catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions in the quarter. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you. And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nFor opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you and welcome to our June 30, 2022, second quarter earnings conference call.\nOur report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. We had a very strong quarter with record operating income driven by outstanding underwriting and investment results as well as double-digit, constant dollar P&C premium growth. Pricing was strong and exceeded loss costs in commercial lines, even as we increased the inflation factors we are using in our loss ratios in anticipation of future increases to loss costs.\nMeanwhile, growth in our consumer businesses continued to accelerate. Core operating income in the quarter was a record $1.8 billion or $4.20 per share, up 16% over prior year. For the year, we have produced over $8 per share, up nearly 31%.\nOur second quarter underwriting results were simply lights out: $1.4 billion of underwriting income, which was up 21% over priorwith a published combined ratio of 84%, both record results. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were reasonably light relative to our expected losses and virtually flat with last year's second quarter. The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, was 83.5%, a nearly two-point improvement over prior year.\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income was a record $950 million for the quarter. As you know, we are predominantly a buy-and-hold fixed-income investor, and given rising interest rates and widening spreads, investment income is and will continue to rise.\nOur reinvestment rate is now averaging 4.7% against a portfolio yield of 3.2%. We have begun to thoughtfully and meaningfully accelerate the turnover of our portfolio in a targeted manner so that we can put cash to work more quickly at higher yields.\nSpreads have moved to more historical averages among the various fixed-income classes and the wind-down of QE could create more volatility and put more pressure on spreads in the future, which would benefit us. Peter will have more to say about these and other financial items.\nAs you saw, we completed the acquisition of the Cigna business. As we had previously announced, the addition of Cigna's A&H and life business in Asia will be immediately accretive to core operating income per share and ROE. We have spent the past 6 to 8 months planning the integration to generate the revenue and earning power the combination of our businesses together in each country should achieve. We are off to a rapid start and are beginning to execute.\nHaving just come back from Asia and met with the teams in Korea and Thailand, morale among our new and existing colleagues is quite high and there is a great sense of optimism in what the future holds for our business in the region. Our Cigna colleagues who are joining us, starting with the leadership, are a great fit with Chubb and our culture.\nNow, turning to growth and the rate environment, total P&C premiums globally increased 9% in the quarter on a published basis, or 11% in constant dollars, with commercial up 12% and consumer up 8%. Growth in the quarter remains broad based with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally, from large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty and most all regions of the world. Commercial P&C premiums for North America were up 12.5% or 8.7% excluding agriculture, while in Overseas General, commercial lines grew 13% in constant dollars. And we then scrub 6 points of FX to arrive at the published result.\nAgriculture premiums were up 44% in the quarter, driven overwhelmingly by crop insurance growth. Commodity prices plus growth in market share produced this result. Looking forward, we will have a very strong crop insurance revenue growth in the third quarter as well.\nIn terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, market conditions overall remain favorable while the level of rate increases is moderating. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns, and additional rate is therefore required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which are hardly benign.\nThe rate environment is naturally becoming a bit more competitive, particularly in certain casualty-related classes, as more carriers seek to now grow. The market is reasonably disciplined, and I expect it will remain so, given not only the specter of loss cost inflation, but the presence of other risk exposures, such as climate change, the war in Ukraine, the litigation environment, cyber and the overall costs of reinsurance. Plenty of reminders to managements to get paid for the exposures underwritten.\nIn the quarter in North America, total Commercial P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, grew 8.7%. Growth this quarter in commercial lines was led by our Major Accounts & Specialty Division, which grew about 10.5%, followed by our middle market and small commercial business, which grew about 6.5%. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was a very strong 101% on a premium basis.\nOverall rates increased in North America commercial lines 7%, while total pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased over 10.5%. Remember, most but not all of the exposure change helps to ameliorate loss cost.\nIn major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased over 8% with pricing up 11.6%. General casualty rates were up nearly 13% and varied by class of casualty. While risk management-related comp and GL were up about 4%. Property rates were up around 9% and financial lines rates were up nearly 7.5%.\nIn our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by just under 10% with pricing up over 14%. Property rates were up over 13%. Casualty was up 8.5% and financial lines rates were up 9.5%.\nIn our middle market business, rates increased nearly 7%, excluding comp, with pricing up about 9%. Rates for property were up 5%. Casualty rates were up over 7%. And comp rates were down 4.3%. However, comp pricing was up over 5% when taking into account exposure change. And finally, financial lines rates were up over 10%.\nTurning to loss cost for a minute, we increased our loss cost trends in North America to 6.5% in anticipation of rising costs, meaning the actual trends we are observing at this time are lower. Again, the 6.5% is compared to pricing that was up over 10.5%.\nIn general, we are trending loss costs for short-tail classes close to 7%, up from 6.5% last quarter. In long-tail, excluding workers' comp, we are trending at 6.5%, up from 6%. And our first-dollar comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5%. These trend factors are contemplated in both our pricing and in our accident year loss picks in the quarter.\nTurning to our international general insurance operations. Retail Commercial P&C premiums grew 12.5% in constant dollars, while our London wholesale business grew over 10%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 14% in Asia Pacific, followed by growth of over 13% in Latin America. Our U.K. and Europe division was up nearly 12%. Internationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate-to-exposure across our commercial portfolio.\nIn our international business, rates increased in the quarter about 9.5%, while we estimate pricing was up about 12%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region. Outside North America, we are currently trending loss costs at about 6.5%, up from 4%, though that varies by class of business and country. Loss cost factors we are using for short-tail are now running over 7%, and in long-tail, we are trending at about 6%. Again, these factors are contemplated in both our pricing and in our accident year loss picks in the quarter, and like in North America, are higher than actual observed trends.\nInternational consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to pick up momentum as premiums increased over 12%, though FX then scrubbed about 7.5 points off the growth. Premiums in our international A&H business grew over 12% in constant dollars, with Latin America up over 19% and Asia Pacific up 13%, while our international personal lines grew 12%.\nNet premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up 4.7% on the back of record new business activity. Our true high net worth client segments grew 12%, while overall retention was very strong at nearly 98%.\nIn our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 10%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10% as well.\nTo sum it all up, we had simply an excellent quarter as I look ahead, I am mindful of the world and conditions in which we operate, including inflation, the specter of recession, the war and energy and food security problems globally.\nWith all that, we have a lot of broad-based momentum and earning power in our organization that gives me confidence. Commercial P&C growth and pricing are favorable, our consumer lines business growth is accelerating, our life company revenue and earnings will accelerate with the addition of the Cigna business in Asia. Asia is now a $7.5 billion region for our company. Our underwriting margins are excellent, and our investment income will grow nicely due to rising rates and strong cash flow. We are well positioned for continued excellent EPS growth well into the future.\nI'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we'll come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning, everyone. As you just heard from Evan, we had another excellent quarter. In addition to the record results, we ended the second quarter in a position of exceptional financial strength. Our strong underlying performance produced operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the quarter and $5.2 billion for the first 6 months.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We have $68 billion in total capital. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of $10.6 billion at quarter end or $5.2 billion after accounting for the cash that was paid on July 1 for the Cigna deal.\nAmong the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $348 million in dividends. Through the 6 months ended June 30, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders.\nThe current quarter included after-tax realized mark-to-market losses on our private and public equities of $489 million compared to gains of $794 million last year. Also included are after-tax losses on sales of fixed maturities of $279 million, in part to advance our portfolio turnover strategy.\nBook and tangible book value per share decreased 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from last quarter driven by the continuing impact of rising interest rates on our investment portfolio and unfavorable foreign currency movements.\nNet realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $5.4 billion after tax.\nIn the quarter, adjusted net investment income of $950 million was above the top end of our estimated range and benefited from higher interest income from floating-rate securities and higher reinvestment yields resulting from portfolio turnover in this more attractive interest rate environment. We are remaining consistent and conservative in our investment strategy with 82% of our fixed-income portfolio rated investment grade, and we intend to maintain our historical allocation across investment assets.\nAs Evan noted, with rising rates, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased year-to-date from 2.3% in December to 4.7% at June 30th. Our current book yield is 3.2% versus 3% in the first quarter. As a reminder, every 100 basis point increase in our investment yield generates approximately $1.2 billion pre-tax of net investment income.\nUpdating our quarterly guidance, we now anticipate adjusted net investment income over the next quarter to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion. And we expect the quality of this income to be high as the vast majority of it will be predictable yield-oriented income and very little from more volatile sources like PE distributions and call premiums.\nOur reported ROE for the quarter was 9%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 18.6%. Our core operating ROE was 12.4%.\nPre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $291 million from weather-related events globally with approximately 79% in the U.S. and 21% internationally. We had favorable prior period development of $247 million pre-tax in the quarter, split approximately 1/3 in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 2/3 in short-tail lines. The current period included a charge from molestation claims related to reviver statutes of $155 million. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 83%.\nOur core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%, which is slightly above the high end of our previously guided 2022 annual range of 15.5% to 17.5%. This was due primarily to growth in higher-tax jurisdictions and the negative impact of adverse market conditions on assets supporting certain employee benefit programs. With an updated forecast of income jurisdiction, along with the closing of the acquisition of Cigna's business, we now expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%.\nAs you saw, we completed the purchase of Cigna's A&H and life businesses in Asia. Our expectations regarding the earnings and expense synergies from Cigna remain consistent with or better than previous disclosures. As a reminder, we reported an expected $450 million of core operating income, assuming a close date of January 1, 2022. With the acquisition completed July 1, we will have a full quarter of earnings in the third quarter. We now expect expense synergies to reach a run rate of about $100 million pre-tax, which is higher than our initial estimate. To achieve that run rate savings, we expect onetime integration costs over the next 2 years to be about $140 million.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nNow for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2022, First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. We had an excellent start to the year with record per share operating earnings and underwriting results, double-digit global P&C commercial lines premium growth, accompanied by rate increases in excess of loss cost, and improving growth in our consumer business globally.\nCore operating income in the quarter was $1.64 billion or a record $3.82 per share, up 52% on a per share basis over prior year.\nIn the quarter, we produced simply outstanding underwriting results. $1.28 billion of underwriting income was more than double prior year with a combined ratio of 84.3%, both records.\nOur P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 83.5%, a 1.7 point improvement over prior year, with about 1 point from loss ratio improvement and the balance, expense driven.\nOn the investment income side, adjusted net investment income was circa $900 million for the quarter. We are predominantly a buy-and-hold fixed income investor. And given rising interest rates and widening spreads, we expect investment income to increase from here. Every 100 basis points increase in interest rates for us is worth, on an annualized basis, about $1.2 billion in pretax investment income.\nWe have a portfolio duration of about 4 years. So a rise in rates begins to earn in reasonably quickly. Peter will have more to say about other financial items.\nLet me say a few words about the Russian-Ukraine war. The events unfolding before our eyes are a human tragedy of epic proportions with profound geopolitical implications. Our actual incurred losses to date from the event are de minimis. And from all we know today, while additional losses may develop over time, this will not represent a meaningful event for Chubb.\nIntegration planning around the Cigna transaction is quite active and remains on track. We expect to receive regulatory approvals leading to a close during the second quarter. There are no changes of substance to the guidance we gave you, and any changes are modestly positive. We will update you after closing.\nNow turning to growth. The rate environment and inflation, Global P&C premiums, which exclude agriculture, increased 8.8% in the quarter on a published basis or 10.7% in constant dollars, with commercial up 12% and consumer up 8%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally.\nFrom large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty in most all regions of the world, Commercial P&C premiums, excluding agriculture for North America were up 10.5%, while in Overseas General, they grew 13% in constant dollars, but we then had 5 points of FX impact to the published results.\nAgriculture premiums were down in the quarter because of a return of premium to the government. It was based on our level of profitability for the '21 crop year. This is a favorable and expected development. You will recall that crop insurance is a business where revenue and losses are shared with the government. For the '22 crop year, we will have a substantial increase in premium revenue over last year, given commodity prices and other factors. Most of this will be recognized in the third quarter.\nReturning to Commercial P&C. In terms of rate, the level of rate increase remains strong, and as I have said before, is naturally moderating as individual portfolios achieve adequacy and additional rate is then required to keep pace with loss costs. The rate environment is reasonably orderly. And in aggregate, rate increases remain in excess of observed and projected loss costs.\nIn the quarter, in North America, total P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, grew 9.6%, again with commercial up 10.5%. Growth this quarter in commercial lines was led by our middle market and small commercial business with premiums up almost 12%, followed by our major accounts in specialty division, which grew 9.5%.\nTotal exposure change was a positive 1 point in the quarter, a combination of an increase in economic exposure of about 3.2% due to higher payroll, sales and other economically sensitive activity; and on the other hand, a decline in exposure due to underwriting changes, such as increased attachment points, and higher deductibles, which is a good thing.\nRenewal retention for our retail commercial businesses is 100% on a premium basis, very strong. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines 8.7%. Major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased 9.3%. General casualty rates were up over 15.5% and varied by class of casualty, while risk management-related primary comp and casualty rates were up 3.7%. Property rates were up 9.1%, and financial lines rates were up 13.9% and varied by subcategory.\nIn our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by more than 11%. Rates were up 13.3% in casualty, about 10% -- sorry, in property. Casualty was up 10%, and financial lines rates were up 15.4%. And in our middle market business, rates increased 7.7% or 9.5% excluding comp. Rates for property were up over 8%. Casualty rates, excluding comp, were up 8.5%, and comp rates were down 1.5%. The comp pricing, which is rate plus exposure, was up over 9%. And finally, financial lines in middle market were up 17%.\nWe are trending loss costs at 6%, and it varies by line. In general, we're trending loss costs in the rates we charge for short-tail classes just over 6.5%, though the actual is running lower. In long tail, excluding workers' comp, we continue to trend at a 6% rate overall. And our first dollar workers' comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5%.\nIn short-tail classes, we are actively monitoring property valuations, loss costs as they develop and the real-time drivers of cost are changes in inflation, labor, parts and supplies as well as the delays caused by supply chain disruptions given the length of time to repair or replace. This can add additional pressure on costs. In long-tail lines, we actively monitor and study both frequency and severity of each class.\nTurning to our International General Insurance operations. Retail commercial P&C premiums grew 15% in constant dollars, while our London wholesale business grew just over 5.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 18.5% in Latin America, followed by growth of about 16.5% in our U.K. and Europe division, and Asia Pac was up 14.5%. Internationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio.\nIn our international retail business, rates increased in the quarter 10%. While in our London wholesale business, rates increased 9%, both varied by class and by region as well as country within region.\nOutside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 4%, though that varies by class of business in country. In general, loss costs for short-tail classes are running just under 4%. And we anticipate this to increase. In long-tail, we are trending at about a 4.5% rate.\nInternational consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's impact on consumer-related activity, and premiums increased about 9.5%, though FX then scrubs 6 points off the growth rate. Premiums in our International A&H business grew 8.6% in constant dollar. Our international personal lines business grew over 10%. Latin America led the way with A&H and personal lines growth of over 18% and 17.5%, respectively, while Asia Pac's growth for these 2 product lines was over 6% and 24.5%, respectively.\nNet premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 7.5%. Last year's reinsurance reinstatement premiums, due to cat losses, had a negative impact on growth. Adjusted for that, was other onetime items, our underlying growth was about 5.5% in the quarter.\nOur true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew over 13% in the quarter, driven by a flight-to-quality of competitors leaving certain markets, while overall retention was very strong at nearly 99%.\nIn our homeowners business, we achieved pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 12.3%, while homeowners loss costs are running in the 11% range. In our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were flat in constant dollar, but will increase in future quarters. While net premiums in our Global Re business were up 22%.\nIn sum, we had an outstanding quarter all around, and we are off to a great start to the year. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic and confident in the things we can control in the way of naturally grown more cautious given the world around us. Economic growth, general inflation and central bank actions and the war come to mind. We will continue to capitalize on favorable underwriting conditions for our Commercial P&C businesses globally.\nConsumer lines growth should continue to recover. As interest rates rise, our investment income will as well. And as I stated last quarter, our strategic investments, including the acquisition of Cigna, and likely later in the year, Huatai, will provide us with greater revenue and earnings growth opportunity.\nI'll now turn the call over to Peter, and then will be back to take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Evan, we are starting the year with an exceptional quarter with strong top line growth and record P&C underwriting results that produced operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the quarter.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong with $73 billion in total capital. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of over $5 billion. I would note, S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed our AA ratings and stable outlook, reflecting our strong financial position.\nAmong the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.3 billion or 82% of core earnings to shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases and $340 million in dividends. As of March 31, $1.6 billion of the $5 billion share repurchase authorization remains available through June 30. We plan to seek authorization from our Board for our annual share repurchase program prior to that date.\nDuring the quarter, rising interest rates caused a mark-to-market pretax unrealized loss of $4.7 billion or 4.5% of our fixed income portfolio. As a comparison, the Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index declined by 6.2% for the quarter. This adverse mark-to-market movement of $3.8 billion after tax or 6.5% of our book value, drove the decline in book and tangible book value per share of 4.4% and 6.8%, respectively. Excluding the unrealized mark-to-market in the investment portfolio, book and tangible book value per share increased by 2.1% and 2.9% respectively.\nAs noted in our supplement, the market rate on our fixed maturity portfolio was 3.4% for the quarter end, exceeding our book yield of 3%. As of last Friday, the market reinvestment rate had increased to 3.8%. Reflecting this rising rate environment, we now expect our adjusted investment income for the second quarter to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, and then it will go up from there.\nOur reported ROE for the quarter was 13.6%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 17.1%. Our core operating ROE was 11.3%. Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $333 million, including $138 million for Australian storms, $65 million for wildfires in Colorado and $130 million for other global weather-related events. We had favorable prior period development of $240 million pretax, essentially all in short-tail lines of $228 million, principally in A&H, property and surety.\nOur paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 91% or 80% after adjusting for cats and prior period development. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for '22 to be in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%.\nNow to finish with a couple of discrete items. First, relative to our exposure in Russia. Our Russian entities have been separated operationally from Chubb and are managing their affairs independently and have been deconsolidated. During the quarter, we impaired the full carrying value of these entities and have recognized a realized loss of $87 million.\nRelative to Cigna, we have amended our purchase agreement to remove the joint venture in Turkey. This amendment will have a de minimis impact on the transaction. As Evan mentioned, we will provide an update with more specifics on the acquisition during the second quarter earnings call.\nI'll now turn it back to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, and welcome to our December 31, 2021, Fourth Quarter and Year-end Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.\nPlease see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that can affect these matters.\nWe will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. And now I'd like to introduce our speakers.\nFirst, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.\n\nEvan G. Greenberg\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Chubb Limited\n\nGood morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent finish to the year with record operating earnings and underwriting results, double-digit commercial premium growth globally, strong levels of rate increase and slow but improving growth in our consumer business globally.\nThis performance led to one of the best years in our company's history, with the best organic growth in P&C premiums in over 15 years and record financial results spanning both net and core operating income, calendar and current accident year underwriting income and investment income. Simply stunning results across the board and a testament to the organization and so many of my colleagues last year.\nCore operating income in the quarter was $1.65 billion or $3.81 per share, up nearly 20% over prior year. For the year, we produced net and core operating income of $8.5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. Again, both record results.\nIn the quarter, $1.27 billion of underwriting income was a 31% increase over prior year with a combined ratio of 85.5. Allow me to digress for just a second. In my judgment, the calendar year or published combined ratio is the primary measure of underwriting performance that investors and management should focus on because natural catastrophes are a regular and expected occurrence and the volatility cannot be dismissed away.\nOur P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was [83 9], a 2.5 point improvement over prior year. This is an important but secondary measure that provides useful insight into the current underlying strength of our businesses.\nFull year P&C underwriting income was a record $3.7 billion, up over 200% and that's with $2.4 billion of catastrophe losses in the second costliest year for the industry in terms of cats. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income topped $900 million for the quarter and was a record $3.7 billion for the year.\nWith the Fed finally accepting that inflation is a reality that is not going away anytime soon, interest rates are rising and will continue to rise. QE is coming to a rapid end and spreads should begin to widen, particularly if the Fed begins to shrink their balance sheet, as they should.\nAs a reminder, every 100 basis points of yield for us provides about $1.2 billion of additional investment income, and we run about a 4-year portfolio duration. As I remarked over a year ago, we're in a period of very strong wealth creation, which is reflected vividly by our quarterly and full year results. And I expect this trend will continue, driven by further growth and margin expansion.\nPeter will have more to say about cats prior period development, investment income, book value and other financial items. Before I get to our discussion of growth in rate, as you saw in the press release, we have entered into agreements with several shareholders to purchase additional ownership interest in Huatai Group in China. Upon regulatory approval, which we expect sometime during '22, our total aggregate ownership will be north of 80%.\nSeparately, integration planning for the Cigna transaction, which we announced in the fourth quarter and I covered on our last call is progressing well. We expect to close in the first half of the year.\nNow turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums in the quarter increased 9.6%, with commercial up 13 and consumer up 2.2. This strong performance capped a year where we grew our premium revenue 13%, the strongest organic growth since '03, with commercial up 17.7% and consumer up 2.3%.\nGrowth in the quarter was broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally, from large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty to agriculture, including most regions of the world.\nCommercial premiums for North America were up over 11%, while in overseas general, they grew 15%. For the year, we have grown our commercial business almost 18%. And for perspective, since 2019, it has grown by nearly 1/3 or over $5 billion of net premium, and that's the size of or bigger than most insurers.\nIn terms of rate, the level of rate increases remains robust and is naturally slowing as portfolios achieve or approach rate adequacy. At the same time, whether short or long-tail exposure, the loss environment is anything but benign. The level of rate increases remains well in excess of loss costs and I expect this trend to continue for some time.\nIn the quarter, in North America, total premiums grew 8.7%, with Commercial up over 11%, driven by growth in our major accounts and specialty business of 12% and our middle market and small commercial business of 9.7%.\nTotal exposure change is actually down 0.6% in the quarter. And it's a combination of an increase in economic exposure of 3.4% due to higher payrolls, sales and other economically sensitive activity; and on the other hand, a decline in exposure due to underwriting changes, such as increased attachment points and higher deductibles, a good thing, though it negatively impacted growth.\nOur retail businesses achieved a 100% retention this quarter on a premium basis and 89% on an account basis, both very strong. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines 10.5%. Loss costs are trending about 5.5% and vary by line.\nIn general, loss costs for short-tail classes are running about 4%. Though again, we anticipate these to rise and have reacted accordingly. In long tail, excluding workers' comp, we are trending at a 6% rate, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5%.\nLet me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by 10.5%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up over 4%. General casualty rates were up over 16% and varied by class of casualty, and property rates were up 9.7%, while financial lines rates were up over 17%.\nIn our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 14.5% in the quarter. Property rates were up 12.5%, casualty was up almost 17%, while financial lines rates were up 18.5%.\nIn our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter about 9%. Rates for property were up 9%. Casualty, excluding comp, were up nearly 9% and comp rates were down 1.5%. While comp pricing on the other hand, which is rate plus exposure, was up about 3%.\nAnd finally, financial lines rates were up about 19%. Turning to our International General Insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 15% on a published basis. International Retail Commercial grew over 13%, while our London wholesale business grew 28%.\nRetail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 19% in our U.K. and Europe division. Asia Pacific was up about 12.5%, while our Latin America commercial business grew over 9%.\nInternationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, rates increased in the quarter 13% with property up 8%, financial lines up 30% and primary and excess casualty up 7% and 11%, respectively.\nBy the way, these rate increases were nearly identical to those from the prior quarter. In our London wholesale business in the quarter, property rates were up 8%, financial Lines rates were up 24% and marine up 5%.\nOutside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. While international consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to be heavily impacted by the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer-related activities, growth continued to slowly recover and was 3.5% on a published and constant dollar basis.\nA clear example of that is our international A&H division, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. And on a currency-adjusted basis, Q4 was our best quarter since the beginning of the pandemic, with growth of 5.5%.\nAcross Asia and Latin America in our direct marketed business through banks, retailers and digital platforms, we are seeing activity pick up for consumer lending, credit card growth and branch openings. In fact, our direct marketing business grew double digits in Latin America, and we had our best growth quarter in the year in Asia Pac.\nAll in all, I expect growth in our consumer lines to continue to improve as the year goes along. The underlying health of the business is excellent. Net premiums in our North America high networth personal lines business were up 3.3%.\nOur true high networth client segment, the heart of our business, grew 13% in the quarter. Overall retention was very strong this quarter at nearly 98%, and we achieved pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 13% -- 13.5% in our homeowners portfolio.\nClaims severity in our U.S. personal lines business is running just under 9%, with homeowners cost to repair and rebuild increasing 11%. In our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up about 25% in the quarter.\nProfitability was impacted this quarter from a true-up of our COVID reserve charges, which overall for the company were net positive, but negatively impacted life. Lastly, net premiums in our Global Re business were up 37%. And while conditions have improved in reinsurance, we remain cautious in most lines. Rates and terms in most classes are still not adequate to earn what we believe is needed to justify the volatility and earn an appropriate risk-adjusted return.\nWe had an outstanding year, and I look ahead -- looking ahead, we're off to a very good start in the first quarter overall. Market conditions remain consistent with what we experienced in the fourth quarter. '22 should be a good year in terms of continued growth and margin improvement as we capitalize on favorable underwriting conditions for our commercial P&C businesses globally.\nI expect rates to continue to exceed loss costs. Consumer lines growth should return as the pandemic eases, though, as you know, there is no certainty. In the future, as rates -- interest rates rise and spreads potentially widen, our investment income will rise, and our strategic investments such as Cigna and Huatai will provide us with greater revenue, earnings and growth opportunity.\nAll of this gives me great confidence in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.\n\nPeter C. Enns\n\nCFO & Executive VP of Chubb Group, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you, Evan, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with the record earnings that Evan highlighted, other key financial metrics were also excellent, including a strong return on equity and book and tangible book value per share that now stand at all-time highs.\nOur strong performance produced operating cash flow of $2.6 billion for the quarter and a record $11.1 billion for the year. We continue to build on our balance sheet strength with capital of $76 billion and cash and invested assets of $124 billion.\nOur investment portfolio of $122 billion, supported by our positive operating cash flow, continues to be of a very high quality, which we expect will continue to support growth in our investment income. At the end of the year, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $2.3 billion after tax.\nAmong the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $905 million in share repurchases and $342 million in dividends.\nFor the year, we returned over $6 billion to shareholders, equaling 112% of our core earnings. This included $4.9 billion in share repurchases or 6.5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of $1.4 billion.\nAs of December 31, $2.6 billion of the share repurchase authorization remains. In November, we issued $600 million of 30-year debt and $1 billion of 40-year debt at a very attractive weighted average cost of under 3%. The proceeds will be used to fund up to $1.1 billion of the purchase price of Cigna's business in Asia Pacific.\nThe remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $475 million of debt due in March 2023. Book and tangible book value per share increased 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively, from last quarter and 6.1% and 7.6%, respectively, from last year and now stand at all-time high of $139.99 and $94.38 per share, respectively.\nOur reported ROE for the quarter and the year was 14.4% and 14.3%, respectively. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 17.7% and 15.3%, respectively. While our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 11.6% and 9.9%.\nAdjusting for the mark-to-market gains on our private equity portfolio, our core operating ROE was 13.1% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year. As I have noted in the past, our investment income is based on many factors. We met our quarterly investment income target of $900 million this quarter after a few quarters of exceeding it, reflecting slightly lower distributions on our PE portfolio compared to recent quarters.\nWe continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million in 2022. Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $275 million, primarily from weather-related events, with about $214 million in the U.S. and $61 million internationally.\nWe had favorable prior period development of $145 million pretax, which included $364 million of favorable development for direct COVID-related liabilities from accident year 2020. We recognized a net charge of $375 million related to the $800 million pending settlement with of America that we previously announced. The net charge takes into account reinsurance and our previously carried reserve. We also recognized $53 million of adverse development related to asbestos as part of our annual reserve review.\nExcluding these items, the remaining development was essentially all favorable development in short tail lines principally in our property and A&H lines. Our reserve position remained strong, with net reserves increasing by $3.8 billion or 7.4% in constant dollars for the year.\nOur paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 98%, primarily reflecting significant net catastrophe loss payments, the seasonality of our crop insurance business and favorable prior period development. Adjusting for these items, our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 78%.\nOur paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 81%. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.7% for the quarter and 15.4% for the year. For 2022, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate will increase slightly to be in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%.\nI'll turn the call back over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Beyer\n\nSVP of IR, Chubb Limited\n\nThank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions."

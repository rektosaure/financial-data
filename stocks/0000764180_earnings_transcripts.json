Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Angela. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's third quarter and first 9 months business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results.

Gifford\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Altria continued to build significant momentum in the third quarter with exciting progress across our businesses. For the third quarter, we delivered strong financial performance growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 3.6%, and we continue to make meaningful progress across our smoke fruit portfolio and toward our long-term adjacency girls.\nOn held steady in a highly competitive environment, and Helix announced plans to launch on! PLUS its innovative next-generation oral product. Horizon also made important regulatory filings for a joint venture and heated tobacco products.\nLooking at our long-term adjacent growth opportunities -- we announced a collaboration with KT&G to explore opportunities in international innovative smoke-free products and U.S. non-nicotine products. And importantly, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.\nIn August, we announced our 60th dividend increase in 56 years -- and yesterday, our Board authorized an expansion of our share repurchase program. My remarks this morning will focus on results from ON and the launch of on! PLUS, updates on our heated tobacco and e-vapor portfolio, the state of the regulatory environment and our strategic relationship with KT&G. I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further details on our business results, 2025 outlook and our continued commitment to providing significant cash returns to shareholders.\nLet's begin with ON and the nicotine pouch category. Oral nicotine pouches continue to be the primary driver of the estimated 14.5% increase in oral tobacco industry volume over the past 6 months. In the third quarter, nicotine pouches grew to 55.7 share points an increase of 11.1 share points year-over-year. Competitor promotional activity was highly elevated during the third quarter, particularly during September. Driving incremental growth for nicotine pouches.\nWe continue to monitor how this elevated promotional activity influences longer-term brand adoption. Despite this competitive landscape, Helix was steady in the third quarter, growing on reported shipment volume to over 42 million cans, representing an increase of nearly 1% and versus the prior year. For the first 9 months, Helix grew on reported shipment volume to over 133 million cans, representing an increase of approximately 15% versus the prior year.\nWhile third quarter shipment volumes for on! were influenced by trade inventory dynamics driven by promotional activity in the category we remain encouraged by the steady consumer demand reflected in our estimated retail takeaway. In fact, One's retail share of the total oral tobacco category was 8.7% for the third quarter and first 9 months, demonstrating stability for the quarter and an increase of 0.8 share points for the first 9 months.\nOn's retail price increased by approximately 1.5% in the third quarter versus the prior year. In contrast to the balance of the nicotine pouch category, where average retail prices for the category declined 7% nationally and more than 70% in 1 major retail chain. A clear reflection of the intense promotional activity during the quarter.\nYet, Helix's year-over-year results continue to be a meaningful contributor to the oral tobacco products segment adjusted OCI stability and adjusted OCI margin expansion in the third quarter.\nHelix is positioning itself for long-term sustainable success. Helix recently launched on! PLUS in Florida, North Carolina and Texas, and we are encouraged by the recent actions from the FDA that signal progress toward a more efficient and transparent authorization process for nicotine pouches, which I'll discuss later in my remarks.\nOn! PLUS launched with 3 flavors and 3 nicotine strengths, which we believe are complementary to the current own portfolio. We believe On! PLUS is a premium and differentiated product that we expect to appeal to both adults who dip and competitive nicotine pouch consumers.\nOn! PLUS uniquely delivers on 3 desirable attributes for pouch consumers. Comfort, nicotine delivery and flavor satisfaction. In recent research, we compared On! PLUS mint against several leading competitive brands. While a small sample size -- On! PLUS outperformed all competitive brands in the sample. Forms achieved the highest purchasing temp score driven by the comfort of the pouch. In addition, innovation and consumer preferences remain at the forefront of Helix strategy. Helix continues to build a pipeline of new on-us flavors and looks forward to bringing them to the U.S. market.\nIn heated tobacco, Horizon completed a key milestone on its path to bring Ploom to the U.S. In August, Horizon filed a combined PMTA and MRTPA with the FDA for Ploom and Marlboro heated tobacco sticks. We believe the science and evidence supporting horizons applications are compelling and present a strong case for FDA authorizations. Our teams are working diligently who includes go-to-market plans and we look forward to engaging smokers with this innovative product. Moving to our e-vapor business and enjoy. We believe we have completed the product design of a modified Enjoy a solution that addresses all 4 disputed patents. Our teams are evaluating the potential pathways to bring the modified ACE product to market.\nDuring the third quarter, both Enjoy and JUUL initiated new litigation against 1 another. JUUL initiated litigation in federal court and before the ITC against Enjoy a certain claims of patent infringement based on sales of enjoy daily and on any other products enjoy may be developing that would infringe JUUL's patents. We do not expect a final determination from the ITC before early 2027, and intend to vigorously defend our positions in this litigation. In addition, Enjoy initiated litigation against JUUL in Federal Court and before the ITC are certain claims of patent infringement based on the sale of certain deal products. As we assess our path forward with ACE and worked diligently on our innovative product pipeline in e-vapor, the market remains saturated with flavored disposable e-vapor products the majority of which we believe have abated the regulatory process.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we estimate the e-vapor category included approximately 21 million vapors up nearly $2 million versus a year ago. During the same period, disposable vapors increased by an estimated $2.4 million to nearly $15 million. We believe that flavored disposable e-vapor products continue to represent over 60% of the category. This remains a significant issue, but we are encouraged by the recent enforcement actions and constructive regulatory dialogue that signaled progress.\nFor some time, we have advocated for stronger enforcement against the list of products as well as for an acceleration in FDA market authorizations for Smokefree products. During the third quarter, we observed notable enforcement efforts targeting the listed products and welcomed positive plans from the FDA regarding the pace of authorizations within the nicotine oral nicotine pouch category.\nOn the enforcement front, we continue to see elevated engagement and action from federal agencies and government officials. These actions included: Coordinated rates executed by the federal multi-agency task force across the U.S., resulting in the seizure of hundreds of thousands of enlisted vapor products from retailers and wholesalers and the potential for further legal action.\nOngoing seizures of illicit products including seizure by HHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of more than 4 million units of illicit vapor products with an estimated retail value over $86 million the largest seizure of this kind and a targeted nationwide operation led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, focused on the list of activity at vape shops.\nThese federal actions alongside efforts at the state and local level are signs of progress. However, we believe sustained and coordinated enforcement is necessary to materially impact the state of the market. We remain steadfast in our commitment to supporting a well-functioning regulatory system.\nIt is critical to unlock the full potential of tobacco harm reduction. These ongoing enforcement efforts are essential to provide adult consumers with access to regulated products that are supported by science and are aligned with public health goals.\nBeyond enforcement, we have been advocating for the FDA to accelerate product authorizations and established a responsible marketplace for smoke-free products. Regulatory speed and clarity are also essential to delivering innovative options that meet adult consumer preferences and advanced [ Harmoduction. ] In September, the FDA launched a pilot program to streamline PMTA reviews for all nicotine pouches and Helix was notified by the FDA and that applications for ARMs are included in the program. We're encouraged by this development from the FDA, and we are actively engaging with the FDA on these product applications.\nWhile the pilot only applies to certain nicotine pouches, we hope it signals broader FDA efforts to increase the speed of regulatory decisions across all smoke-free platforms. As we pursue the smoke-free opportunity within the U.S., we remain committed to our long-term adjacent growth goals. In September, we took another step forward when we announced a new collaboration with KT&G.\nFirst, we are jointly exploring opportunities to grow global demand for nicotine pouch products. including the potential expansion of the own portfolio into select international markets. As part of our initial steps in international modern oral, we entered into an agreement with KT&G to acquire an ownership interest in another snus factory, the manufacturer of the Loop Nitin Couch brand.\nLoop is currently available in a range of strengths with unique flavors. Our research shows that complex flavors are driving growth for modern oral in international markets, and we are pleased to add our investment in ASF to complement our portfolio of ON, On! PLUS and Tumi to effectively compete across all modern oral product segments.\nSecond, our collaboration includes the exploration of opportunities in U.S. non-item, specifically in the energy and wellness space with KT&G's Korea Jensen Corporation, leveraging their product expertise and our commercial capabilities.\nIn addition, as part of our relationship with KT&G, we're exploring ways to improve operational efficiency in traditional tobacco with the potential benefits for both companies and our respective home regions. We believe this collaboration further supports our enterprise goals and may strengthen our capabilities relevant to international nicotine products.\nWe're excited about our new relationship with KT&G and look forward to providing updates on our joint efforts.\nIn summary, Altria continued to build momentum in the third quarter. Our core tobacco businesses remained resilient. We advanced our smoke-free portfolio -- and we opened new pathways for long-term adjacent growth in international modern gold and U.S. non-nicotine innovation. These efforts support the commitment to our vision and enterprise goals.\nI'm confident in our strategy, energized by the opportunities ahead and thankful for our team's continued dedication to delivering long-term shareholder value.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Billy. Altria delivered strong third quarter and first 9 months financial performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3.6% in the third quarter and by 5.9% for the first 9 months.\nIn the smokeable products segment, adjusted operating company's income grew by 0.7% to nearly $3 billion in the third quarter and by 2.5% to $8.4 billion for the first 9 months. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to 64.4% for the third quarter and first 9 months, representing impressive margin growth of 1.3 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points, respectively.\nSmokeable Products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.2% in the third quarter and 10.6% for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, the segment's domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter declined by an estimated 9%, slightly above the estimated 8% volume declines at the industry level.\nFor the first 9 months, when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, the segment's domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10.5% and and by 8.5% at the industry level.\nPM USA continues to execute on its strategy of maximizing profitability over the long term. While maintaining its focus on Marlboro and the premium segment, PM USA recognizes the opportunity to compete within the discount segment, guided by data-driven strategies. Within the highly profitable premium segment, Marlboro maintained its long-standing leadership in the category.\nIn the third quarter, Marlboro expanded its share of the premium segment by 3/10 to 59.6% versus the prior year and by 1/10 sequentially. At the same time, PM USA continued to strategically invest behind basic, appealing to a price-sensitive cohort of adult smokers within the discount segment. Many adult smokers continue to face discretionary spending pressures resulting from a variety of macroeconomic headwinds, including the compounding effects of inflation.\nLeveraging PM USA's data analytics and robust RGM tools, basic grew 0.9 share point sequentially and 1.4 share points year-over-year for the third quarter. The discount segment of the industry expanded by 2.4 share points year-over-year with basic capturing over half of that growth.\nImportantly, our data show that most of basic share gains came from adult smokers already within the discount segment, with limited impact on Marlboro. As a result of the combined efforts across the PM USA portfolio of brands, cigarette retail share increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter to 45.4%, growing 0.3 share points in the third quarter.\nCigars also continued to be a meaningful contributor to our smokeable products segment results. For the third quarter and the 9 months, Middleton reported shipment volume increased 2% and and 1.1%, respectively, as Middleton outperformed in the large mass cigar industry.\nLet's turn now to the Oral Tobacco Products segment. In the third quarter, adjusted OCI declined by less than 1%. Over the same period, the segment saw improved profitability through impressive adjusted OCI margin expansion of 2.4 percentage points to 69.2%. For the first 9 months, adjusted OCI increased by 3.3%, with adjusted OCI margin expansion of 1.8 percentage points to 69%.\nCalix' year-over-year performance was a meaningful contributor to the stability of adjusted OCI in the third quarter and to the adjusted OCI growth for the first 9 months. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased 9.6% for the third quarter and 5.2% for the first 9 months. As growth in AN was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, we estimate that third quarter and first 9 months, oral tobacco products segment volumes declined by an estimated 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively.\nOral Tobacco Products segment retail share was 31.1% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first 9 months. In the highly profitable moist smokeless tobacco segment, Copenhagen continued to maintain its long-standing premium leadership.\nTurning to ABI's financial results. We recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the third quarter, up 9% and versus the prior year. As Billy mentioned, our businesses performed well in a dynamic environment during the first 9 months of the year, and we effectively maintained the strength of our core tobacco businesses while investing toward our vision.\nAs a result, we raised the lower end of our 2025 guidance range. We now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $5.37 to $5.45, representing a growth rate of 3.5% and to 5% from a base of $5.19 in 2024. We expect EPS growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as we lap the lower share count associated with the 2024 accelerated share repurchase program and the benefit of the MSA legal fund expiration.\nWe are also mindful of the challenged state of tobacco consumers and will continue to closely monitor the purchasing behaviors. Our strong financial performance for the first 9 months enabled us to return nearly $6 billion to our shareholders, including $5.2 billion in dividends and $712 million in share repurchases.\nWe remain committed to providing significant cash returns to our shareholders. as demonstrated by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase announcement. In August, our board increased our regular quarterly dividend by 3.9% to $1.06 per share, marking our 60th dividend increase in 56 years. This milestone underscores our legacy of delivering consistent shareholder value and highlights the resilience of our businesses through decades of change.\nAnd today, we announced that our Board authorized the expansion of our existing share repurchase program from $1 billion to $2 billion, which now expires on December 31 and 2026. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 was in line with our target of approximately 2x. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions.\nWhile the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.\nOperator, let's open the question-and-answer period.",

At any time, representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Altria Client Services\n\nThanks, Leo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning. Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO, and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's Q2 and first half business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics, and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com during our call today. Unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2024.\nOur remarks contain forward-looking statements including projections of future results.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, we continued the pursuit of our vision while maintaining our strong and profitable core businesses. In oral tobacco, on! delivered strong performance and was a substantial driver of the segment's growth in the quarter. We continue to press for actions that will shape a fully regulated industry and provide expanded product choices for adult nicotine consumers, and we returned significant value to our loyal shareholders during the first half of the year, with more than $4 billion delivered through dividends and share repurchases.\nOur operating companies delivered strong financial results in a dynamic marketplace, allowing us to raise the lower end of our 2025 guidance range. My remarks this morning will focus on Q2 and first half results, from on!, next steps for NJOY, and the state of the regulatory environment. I'll then turn it over to Sal who will provide further detail on our business results and 2025 outlook.\nLet's begin with on! and the nicotine pouch category. Oral nicotine pouches continue to be the primary growth driver of the estimated 11% increase in oral tobacco industry volume over the past six months. In the Q2, oral nicotine pouches grew 10 share points year-over year and now represent more than half of the category.\nWithin this increasingly competitive environment, Helix continued to grow volume and share, with on! reported shipment volume increasing by 26.5% to 52.1 million cans versus the year ago period. On!'s retail share of the total oral tobacco category was 8.7%, an increase of 0.7 share points versus the prior year.\nLast year, Helix launched its own campaign to differentiate the products, build emotional connections with its target audience, and drive greater brand awareness. As part of the campaign rollout, the team used in-person activations to engage directly with adult consumers at action-packed events such as music festivals, NASCAR races, and premier golf tournaments. These one-to-one interactions allow consumers to connect with brand representatives, gain deeper insights into the product, and experience the brand in a tangible, memorable way. In first half of 2025, Helix reached over 170,000 adult tobacco consumers through these in-person activations. Helix's digital marketing channels amplified these experiences, reinforcing on!'s unique brand positioning across multiple touch points.\nIn Q2, digital impressions more than doubled to approximately 190 million.\nAs a result of these combined efforts and continued strong presence at retail, on! brand awareness among adult tobacco consumers increased 7 percentage points in first half of 2025 versus a year ago.\nHelix will continue to focus on driving, trial building, long-term equity, and increasing profitability. In fact, on!'s improving financial performance drove the majority of the oral segment's substantial profit growth for the quarter.\nMoving to our e-vapor business and NJOY in June, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board did not agree with our argument to invalidate Juul's patent. While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we're actively exploring all potential next steps, including an appeal. Meanwhile, we completed the product design of a modified NJOY ACE solution that we believe addresses all four disputed patents.\nAdditionally, our product development teams are actively building a broader vapor portfolio of products that align with evolving expectations of today's consumers.\nLet's now turn to the state of regulation in the US nicotine market, where we continue to believe significant progress needs to be made to fulfill the promise of tobacco harm reduction.\nFor some time we've been advocating for enforcement against products that have completely evaded the regulatory process and for an acceleration in FDA market authorizations to create a responsible marketplace of smoke-free products for all adult consumers.\nAs it relates to enforcement, the flavored disposable market continues to drive e-vapor category growth.\nAt the end of the quarter, we estimate the e-vapor category included more than 20.5 million vapers, up over 1.9 million versus a year ago.\nDuring the same period, disposable vapors increased by an estimated 2.7 million to approximately 14.4 million.\nWe continue to estimate that flavored e-vapor disposable products, the majority of which we believe have evaded the regulatory process, represent more than 60% of the category.\nWhile this issue remains significant, we see signs that enforcement actions have picked up momentum. Key government officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the FDA have publicly acknowledged the severity of the issue, and there is bipartisan support in Congress for urgent action across government agencies.\nWe're encouraged by recent actions by Customs and Border Protection, FDA, state legislatures, and state attorneys general to prevent the importation of illicit e-vapor products evading the regulatory system.\nKey actions from these stakeholders this year include FDA strengthening its import policy, reducing the possibility of imported vapor products bypassing FDA review.\nTighter border controls, which have resulted in a higher percentage of rejections of properly declared e-vapor shipments from China than ever before.\nFDA issuing warning letters to 24 importers responsible for importing illicit products.\nState attorneys general issuing warnings and bringing civil litigation addressing illicit Chinese vapor importers and distributors.\nThe net effect of these recent actions is that it is becoming more difficult to import illicit e-vapor products. In fact, some wholesalers have recently reported supply shortages of some of the most popular disposable brands, citing enforcement at the ports and tariffs. We believe these changes have prompted e-vapor importers to misdeclare their shipments, resulting in illicit products entering the country undetected.\nWhile we're seeing some progress, more consistent action needs to be taken to deliver sustainable long-term results.\nWe continue to advocate at the federal and state levels for more coordinated and decisive actions against illicit actors. Illicit e-vapor enforcement is only one area where the regulatory system is failing. The FDA must accelerate product authorizations across all tobacco categories.\nTo review and decide PMTAs within 180 days. We have waited over five years for a decision on some product applications.\nWe continue to urge FDA to implement a workable process that results in timely decision making to meet their statutory requirements and promotes public health.\nWe believe these steps are critical to establish a nicotine marketplace that offers adult smokers expanded choices in smoke-free products and gives consumers comfort in the oversight of the products available to them.\nIn summary, we remained encouraged by the strong performance of our operating companies in challenging marketplace conditions. Our highly cash generative core businesses supported continued investments in our smoke free products.\nThe increased focus by key stakeholders on cleaning up the illicit market reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook for our smoke-free portfolio. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our business results.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nThanks Billy. As Billy described in his opening remarks, Altria delivered strong Q2 and first half financial performance.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $1.44 in Q2 and increased by 7.2% for the first half, driven by robust adjusted OCI growth and the benefit of share repurchases over the past year.\nIn the smokable products segment, adjusted operating companies income grew by 4.2% to $2.9 billion in the Q2 and by 3.5% to $5.5 billion in the first half. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to 64.5% for the Q2 and the first half. This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 10% for the quarter and 10.4% for the first half.\nTotal smokable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 10.2% in Q2 and 11.9% for the first half when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements. The segment's domestic cigarette volumes for Q2 and first half declined by an estimated 10.5% and 11% respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.5% in Q2 and for the first half when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences, and other factors.\nWhile our smokable business is focused on Marlboro in the premium segment, adult smokers continue to face macroeconomic pressures. The compounding effects of inflation exceeding overall wage growth, especially among low-income consumers, contributed to the discount segment growing 1.9 share points year-over-year and 4.1 sequentially. To better compete in the discount segment and informed by our data analytics, PM USA strategically expanded Basic into approximately 30,000 targeted stores in the Q2. Basic's retail share grew 4.1 sequentially with limited impact on Marlboro. As a result, total PM USA cigarette retail share increased 2.1 sequentially to 45.2% in the Q2. The targeted launch of Basic demonstrates how PM USA is using its broad toolkit of portfolio brands and sophisticated data analytics to provide the right value to the right consumer while preserving the strength of the Marlboro brand.\nWithin the highly profitable premium segment, Marlboro maintained its long-standing leadership in the category. In the Q2, Marlboro expanded its share of the premium segment by 2.1 to 59.5%.\nIn cigars. Reported shipment volume increased 3.7% as Middleton continued to outperform in the large mass cigar industry.\nLet's turn now to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI grew by an impressive 10.9% in the Q2 and 5.5% in the first half. Adjusted OCI margins increased by 3.1 percentage points for the Q2 and 1.4 percentage points for the first half. As Billy mentioned, these results were mainly driven by on!'s strong performance in the Q2.\nTotal segment reported shipment volume decreased 1% for the Q2 and 2.9% for the first half as growth in on! was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, we estimate that Q2 and first half oral tobacco product segment volumes declined by approximately 4% and 2.5% respectively.\nOral tobacco products segment retail share was 33.1% for the Q2 and 33.9% for the first half as declines in our MST brands were not fully offset by share gains from on!. In the highly profitable moist smokeless tobacco segment, Copenhagen continued to maintain its long-standing premium leadership.\nTurning to ABI's financial results, we recorded $130 million of adjusted equity earnings in the Q2, down 10.3% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a lower ownership interest compared to the year ago period, reflecting the sale of a portion of our ABI investment last year.\nWe continue to view our ABI stake as a financial investment and our goal remains to maximize the long term value of the investment for our shareholders.\nAs Billy mentioned, our businesses performed well in a dynamic environment during the first half of the year. As a result, we raised the lower end of our 2025 guidance range. We now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $5.35 to 5.45, representing a growth rate of 3% to 5%. From a base of $5.19 in 2024.\nWe expect EPS growth to moderate as we lap the lower share count associated with the 2024 accelerated share repurchase program and the benefit of the MSA legal fund expiration. We are also mindful of the challenged state of tobacco consumers and will continue to closely monitor their purchasing behaviors.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I'd like to highlight the significant value we return to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we paid approximately $3.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 10.4 million shares for $600 million. At the end of the Q2, we had $400 million remaining under our current share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the year. In addition, our balance sheet remains strong. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio as of 30 June was 2.0x in line with our target of approximately 2x.\nWith that, we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions while the calls are being compiled. I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics which include pricing, inventory, and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touchtone phone at this time. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first.\nOur first question comes from Matthew Smith of Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning Billy and Sal. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nGood morning.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nI wanted to first talk about the raising of the lower end of the guidance range. You've had a really nice performance in the underlying OCI growth here in the Q2, even when you strip out the lower legal settlement benefit. But it looks like the second half doesn't require as strong of an underlying OCI performance, at least at the higher end of the range.\nYou laid out the dynamics here in terms of EPS phasing when you lap the MSA, the MSA benefit, and the share repo, but on an underlying basis. Can you talk about your expectations in second half of the year and how you're thinking about what could be an even more uncertain consumer environment given some of the inflationary pressure which may pick up as we get further into the back half of the year? Thank you.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nSure. Good morning, Matt. Let me start by saying we're really pleased with our first half results and our updated EPS guidance range. I think you've summarized well the items we highlighted in our opening remarks: lapping of the 2024 accelerated share repurchase program, the expiration of the legal fund which occurred in Q4 of last year.\nAnd then you rightly highlight that it's a dynamic market, and we're going to continue to monitor the state of the adult tobacco consumer and their purchasing behaviors. Inflation is still an unknown variable going forward. There's been some green shoots. Lower gas prices on a year-over-year basis even though they remain high. Most recently, we have seen an uptick in consumer confidence. But again, the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and somewhat unsettled. Trade deals are still being negotiated, and what potential impact that could have on controllable spending for the consumer is something that we'll pay close attention to. But again, really happy with the first half results. Happy, happy that we were able to narrow guidance by lowering the bottom end of that range.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nThank you. Sal and Billy, a question for you. As a follow up on NJOY e-vapor, you talked about working around or developing a new NJOY ACE device that seems to not.\nSeems to work around the patents that were in dispute with ITC. But if I heard you correctly, that product is still or has finalized product development. Can you give an update on the path from here as to when you think you could have an application to FDA for that updated device and what kind of application that would be in terms of a more streamlined authorization process relative to just a traditional PMTA. Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. And don't forget, Matt, that we still have litigation routes that we can take and we're investigating those. But from the standpoint of the patents, you're right. You'll recall that we had already filed three of those patent workarounds or taking care of any disputed facts related to patent infringement from the ITC. We've already filed those. The fourth patent, we're at product lock.\nWe'll be proceeding down that path. We're actually encouraged by the fact that we're excited to be able to bring that to market. It was making great strides when it was in market. The consumer liked the device and the experience they had with NJOY. The brand team had built a great brand around it. So we're excited to be able to bring that back. While I can't satisfy you, we've given you an exact date. We'll continue to update you as we make progress against that. In addition to that, we wanted to really focus on the consumer and, as you heard in my remarks, really finding what the consumer likes in some of the devices that they're using even though they may be coming to the US illicitly and have those, I guess, desirable traits in our pipeline of products and so more.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nThank you, Billy. I'll pass it on.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a follow-up question, I guess, on your guidance, especially, I guess, given the lapping of the legal fee elimination in Q4. I guess, you know, how are you feeling about your ability to deliver on your long-term EPS growth algo of mid-single digits through FY 2028? I mean, it does imply that growth will need to step up quite a bit in the next few years. So, hoping maybe, Billy, to get your perspective on this and, you know, how confident you are that you're going to be able to deliver on that.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, we still have that as a goal of the way we're managing our business, Bonnie. And when you think about it, you know, it's a mid single digits CAGR across that period. You saw the results from the first half of this year. We're very pleased with the results even in a challenging environment based on the, as Sal had mentioned, the macroeconomic outlook. Our consumer is still under strain, economic strain. We feel like we made some very disciplined and smart moves in the marketplace to help the consumer with that. And from a standpoint of the consumer themselves. You know Sal mentioned gas prices. They stabilized and even slightly down, but they're, call it, around $3 a gallon across the US. That's still fairly high.\nBut what we're seeing is, what we've seen historically is if things are stagnant for a period of time, they don't necessarily always have to decrease. Our consumer can start getting comfortable with their situation, and because of the loyalty in the tobacco industry, they'll make different choices.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, maybe another question a little bit along the lines of what you just mentioned about sort of your consumer and retaining them. I do want to ask about Basic. Could you talk a little bit more about your strategy with the brand and the changes you've made to your promotions on the brand? I guess love to hear from you. You know what your ultimate strategy is for Basic and how are you thinking about possibly taking greater discount share versus trying to retain consumers in your total brand family. Thanks.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I appreciate the question, Bonnie. Not abnormal for us. If you go back in history, Basic was there a discount play. We had priced it up and L&M was our discount play. Now we price L&M up and reposition Basic as their discount play. I think the difference being is that now with the amount of data we receive from retail and the RGM analytics, the revenue growth management analytics that we have, we can be very precise and targeted. You know, you saw the results on Basic and approximately 30,000 stores. And so a very targeted approach where the store itself skews heavy discount and be there for the consumers. And to your point, we find it cheaper to keep the consumer in our portfolio as then we can.\nMarket to them individually as their economic situation changes through time. It's about keeping them in our portfolio of brands being there for the consumer and have an open conversation with them through time.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's helpful, Billy. And just to confirm, so far, because these changes are relatively new, have you been pleased sort of with the results? It's kind of, you know, working out the way you were expecting. And so you're going to continue some of these efforts behind Basic?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. While I won't speak to the future because I don't want to give the competition a playbook to go by, we're very pleased with the results, and I think it shows that the quality of data analytics we have with our colleagues across Altria being able to have those results in a short period of time with a very targeted approach.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you for that. I'll pass it on.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Faham Baig of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for taking questions as well. Good morning. A couple from me as well, please. I'll start with.\nYou're noticing crackdowns on illicit vapes and more restrictions at the border. I just want to understand whether the net impact of the import restrictions versus the product still coming through mislabeling is having a neutral impact or a positive impact, and whether that could be driving some of the improvement in cigarette volumes we've seen over the last couple of months. So I want to try to understand that a bit better. And then the second question.\nI noticed the federal excise tax per pack was $0.03 lower than normal. I appreciate there has been some commentary on drawbacks and imports. Anything you would highlight on this and how we should think about this line item going forward? Thanks.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nSure. I appreciate your questions, and I'll try to take them in order. But if I missed anything, please follow up. I think when you think about enforcement, we certainly are encouraged by some of the momentum we're seeing. The new commissioner has been in place about 100 days, and we've seen significant momentum since he's taken over. But as he stated, I believe publicly there's more to do there, and we look forward to him and the FDA and the other agencies doing more. I think it's too soon to call it a trend one way or the other. Certainly it's upstream, if you will, because that's part of the distribution, is that the distributor, wholesaler, and importer. It's hard to say whether that's taken place and whether the consumer has felt it yet in the marketplace at retail.\nCertainly with the mislabeling, that's just another step of illegality from a standpoint of mislabeling products to get them into the US and circumventing, first evading the FDA, and now trying to evade the Customs and Border Protection. So I think it remains to be seen, as you heard in my remarks, we need consistent action. That's what we're looking forward and are hopeful with the new commissioner in place and the momentum we've seen pick up as far as FET. It's an interesting one, I think, when you step back and look broadly. We're an American company with American manufacturing, and so we believe that policy, especially tax policy, should support American manufacturing and that FET should be paid on cigarettes sold in the US and this drawback policy actually goes against both of those.\nWe've seen a number of competitors taking advantage of this, some pretty, pretty large advantage of that. So we're going to look for partnerships because we're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nI'm sorry, I missed the last comment.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nNo, I just said thanks a lot.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Eric Serotta of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Just to follow up on the last question, around illicit vape, there have been several press stories about shortages for particular leading brands or products of illicit products over the past couple of months. Wondering if that's something that you've seen in the marketplace. Have you seen some of the illicit actors sort of adapting their brands or.\nProducts.\nOr, you know, is it just too early to say?\nOverall,\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nyeah, it's a bit early. But what I can remark on that is because there's shutting down one brand just allows the consumers to make different choices if they desire a certain flavor or a certain type of device. So that's why we are calling for more consumer action through time to really clean up the marketplace and get the progress for harm reduction moving forward on the right foot. I think from a standpoint of have we seen diversions in the past? We've seen the same manufacturer change brand names and packaging, but it's exactly the same as what was before. And as I mentioned earlier, we're certainly seeing now that the Customs and Border Protection is appropriately. We have seen instances of misdeclaration and calling it something else other than e-vapor.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. And then, to follow up, coming back to NJOY, the past couple of quarters, you seem to have had a little bit more of a cautious tone or comment of, you know, essentially we're not, we're not going to rush a product back to market when, you know, the market is totally in disarray.\nMaybe I didn't really catch it, again, I'm quite, but I don't know if I heard a similar comment this time. You know, in this quarter's prepared remarks, and you know, has your view in terms of.\nThe ability to compete in vape and sort of the timing of when you would be able to come back to market really changed at all?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I wouldn't see it as change. And if you took that from our remarks, let me just restate. We're certainly excited to be able to bring NJOY back to marketplace when it's appropriate. We were making great strides in capturing consumers, but the state of play in the e-vapor market hasn't changed. And you see total e-vapor consumers, call it about 20.5 million consumers, and about 14.4 million of those are disposable vapers. And we believe a large portion of that is making it to the marketplace illicitly. And so when you see that state of play, remember disposables are increasing. That means that pod-based products are decreasing. And you can see that in intake, takeaway, and share at retail if you include the disposable marketplace or an estimate of it.\nCertainly when we bring it back to market, we're going to be disciplined about it and we're excited when it's appropriate to be able to bring that back to market.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for the clarification there.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Gaurav Jain of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning, Billy. Good morning, Sal. So questions from me. One is on this double duty drawback. You know the question which was asked earlier. So if I look at the price at which you are selling Basic and if I assume full excise tax, full MSA, then it is hard to conclude that there will be any EBIT left unless you are claiming this double duty drawback on Basic. So could you talk about how this works and is it more focused on the discount cigarettes and deep discount cigarettes?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I wouldn't conflate those to Gaurav. I would keep those two separate. Basic is being able to use and utilize our RGM analytics in the marketplace to continue to serve consumers and keep them at our portfolio of brands. This drawback is a totally separate issue. When you look at kind of the progress on the big beautiful bill you saw, when it was proposed by the House, they were removing that because they saw it as bad policy. When it went to the Senate side, there were a number of senators that removed that from it. And what you see is competition that has international manufacturing and domestic; they just flip flop production, and that allows them to.\nBasically, import product into the US without any FET paid. So certainly with us being a domestic manufacturer, which you would think tax policy would support, we're certainly going to look to not be at a competitive disadvantage now that it's apparent law.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you. My second question is on this enforcement on e-cigarettes, which you alluded to is happening. If I look at cigarette volumes over the last two months, they have improved a bit. They are like -7.5%, a number we haven't seen in two, three years. But if I look at the pod-based system shipments in Nielsen data, it is still continuing with same trend of -8% to -9% declines. So is it that this reduction in disposable e-cigarettes is helping the cigarette industry more than it is helping the pod-based industry?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nI think when you look at it, Gaurav, I would say that when you look at the decomp, you can see that the change in cigarette volume decline was really in that macroeconomic and cross category. I would say it's a bit of both that's benefiting the cigarette industry. That's why we're pushing the FDA to authorize more products because the consumers made a choice for smoke free. If they authorize products that have gone through the science review, then we'll have consumers moving to products that are appropriate for public health. And so both from an enforcement standpoint and an authorization is where we need the FDA to move. When you step back and look at it, it's a proof of concept that consumers will move exactly as we've been saying once they find products that satisfy them. And we can really make progress on reduced harm.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nSure.\nMy last question is, you know, on NGP. So, you know, you are a US manufacturer, you don't have an international business, but do you think there are some of these international markets now where you can have a NGP only business and make it profitable? And you have, like you, as you mentioned, you are pursuing multiple e-cigarette options. You clearly have on!, which is there internationally. So are there some international markets where you think you can now create a NGP only business?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nWe do believe that, Gaurav. And you recall as far as our corporate goals, that is one of them from a growth standpoint. You'll recall that from a nicotine pouch. We actually have that in distribution in the Nordic region and in the UK, and we're pleased with the progress we're making there, and we do believe that we can be successful in NGP internationally through time. I think the way you should think about that is we're going to be disciplined about it as we move forward.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Damian McNeela of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nMorning, everybody. Thank you for the questions. First question is just on!\nWhether you can sort of provide any color on what your plans are for the second half in terms of whether you're expecting to accelerate activation for the brand, and also whether you could quantify how well distributed the brand is currently in the US, and then my second question is just on Middleton. Can you sort of provide an explanation of what's behind that sort of pretty decent performance, please?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think when you think about on!, I'll be careful not to lay out exactly what we're going to do in the second half. But you see the success that we've had through the first half, we believe that is sustainable. We're excited about being able to bring our pipeline of products to the marketplace when appropriate because we feel like some of the pipeline of products are very competitive with existing products in the marketplace. As we've shared before. I think when you think about on! and the activations certainly reinforcing the equity and what we feel like is a bit different than the rest of the industry focusing on equity and building a sustainable brand over time for their on! portfolio products when we can bring others to market. I think as far as that reminds me of the second part of your question. Middleton.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, Middleton volume was, you know, it is the dominant cigar in the highly profitable large mass machine made cigar category. And it's a dominant player. It's a very strong premium brand. I think when you look at volume and you look within a quarter, there's always movement within the distribution channel in terms of inventory movements and things like that. But overall Middleton continues to be a strong performer in the smokable segment.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Gerald Pascarelli of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nManaging Director, Needham & Company\n\nGreat, thanks very much. I just wanted to go back to on!, maybe ask it another way, but you know, your volume growth of 26.5% was definitely higher than what we were expecting on a tougher comp. But you did lose share of the category. And so as the category continues to expand, becomes increasingly competitive, just maybe some of the initiatives you have in place to protect your share position. And then just in terms of the revised EPS guidance, does that in any way contemplate maybe increased investment spending behind on! in the back half of the year? Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you. I'll take the first half and Sal. You can pick up on the EPS. I think when you think about on!, it's really about reinforcing the equity.\nI think the team has gotten very good about using RGM that we've perfected in some of our other categories of continuing to induce trial but not having to over subsidize local consumers of the on! brand. It's about going out and reaching them where the consumer is. You heard some of the comments, whether that's music festivals, NASCAR races, or things of that nature, reinforcing the brand to the consumer so that they feel good not only about the product but about the brand itself. From that standpoint, you're right; competition is picking up. As far as a quarter shipment share and of that nature, I would ask you to look over a longer period of time. Certainly you're going to have shipments that are going through the distribution channel and things of that nature that can distort a quarter.\nI would look at both volume and share over a longer period.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. And Gerald, as far as guidance, you know I'm not going to provide any information about promotional activity in the second half. But what I will say is that the guidance does contemplate our continued support of our, of our vision and the development of product pipeline within the smoke free innovative tobacco categories or nicotine categories. And of course the continued support of the on! brand as it continues to. We continue to drive.\nTrial, awareness, and conversion for that brand.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nManaging Director, Needham & Company\n\nPerfect. Thanks very much, guys.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd once again, to ask a question, please press the star and the number one on your touch-tone telephone at this time.\nOur next question is from Emma Rumney of Reuters. Your line is open.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nHi guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about tariffs because the guidance statement said it accounts for increased tariff costs given that NJOY isn't actually on the market at the moment and isn't expected to return this year. Could you talk me through specifically what parts of your business are affected by increased tariffs and on which countries? Thank you.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, sure.\nSo first what I would tell you is that while tariffs have had an impact on our costs, we don't view them as material to our overall business, and they have been contemplated in the guidance that we have provided you. As far as where they do impact, we do sometimes see the impact of tariffs in our supply chain, our direct materials, as an example, in some of the packaging material we use because some of our supply chain is overseas or international based. But again, I think what's more important for us is to monitor the impact of tariffs on the adult tobacco consumer and the potential impact on costs of everyday items that they are purchasing, and how that could impact purchasing behaviors of the consumer. So again, it's something we monitor closely, and we'll be watching as the year plays out.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nGot it. Is that packaging for your cigarettes, oral tobacco, or all of the above?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, it's metal for foil liners, it's tin cans, things like that. So you can see it there and you see it in some other areas. But again, it's something that's been contemplated and unlike many other CPG companies, it really has not had a material impact on our overall costs.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nYeah. So not significant enough to sort of spark price increases or changes to the supply chain or anything?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nWell, I'm not going to talk about.\nPrice increases, but no, nothing, nothing material on a cost basis.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. And changes to the supply chain, would you look at those? Or again, is it not material enough to.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nNo, we always look at.\nWe're always looking at changes to supply chain. What I mean by that is having optionality across the supply chain with different vendors, different geographies, and our ability to manage inventory levels as an example. Our leaf is a multiple-year crops that we're managing. So we do have flexibility. Our supply chain folks, our procurement folks, do a terrific job of managing the different variables that they face. Maintaining a strong supply chain is important to us, of course, in high-margin business. So they do a terrific job. So we feel very comfortable with it.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nCool. I think there are some tariffs on markets like Malaysia, for example, that weren't in place last time you updated the market, which would affect NJOY when you did want to start importing it again. Are you thinking about that and how you might be able to mitigate the impact once you are ready to start importing the device?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, look, we're always thinking about it. I'm not going to get into details of the supply chain, but we do have flexibility in the supply chain related to NJOY. But as you know, there are tariffs across the international market that are part of our consideration set right now. NJOY, as you said, is not in the market. We continue to work to bring it back into the market with some of the IP work that Billy talked about earlier. But again, we feel very comfortable with the optionality we have in our e-vapor category.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nCool. Thanks very much. Appreciate you taking my question.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nThere appears to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mac Livingston for any closing remarks.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Altria Client Services\n\nThank you for joining us today. Everyone, have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.\nSam.\nSa.",

The release, presentation, quarterly metrics, and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2024. Our remarks contain forward-looking statements, including projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our board of directors. We report our financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.\nToday's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a fixed tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning and thank you. Highly profitable traditional tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging environment in Q1. The smokable products segment delivered solid adjusted operating companies income growth behind the strength of Marlboro. In the oral tobacco product segment, on! maintained momentum in a competitive marketplace as Helix invested strategically behind the brand. Shareholders continued to benefit from strong cash returns through dividends and share repurchases while we invested in pursuit of our vision.\nMy remarks this morning will focus on encouraging Q1 results from on!, the state of the e-vapor category, enforcement progress, and our path forward with e-vapor. I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further detail on our business results. Let's begin with on! and the nicotine pouch category. on! nicotine pouches drove the estimated 10% increase volume over the past six months.\nIn Q1, on! nicotine pouches grew 8.7 share points and now represent nearly half of the oral tobacco category. Helix delivered strong performance in a very competitive environment this quarter, growing on! reported shipment volume to over 39 million cans, representing 18% growth. on! continued its momentum at retail, expanding its share of the oral tobacco category to 8.8%, an increase of 1.8 share points versus the prior year, and 0.1 share point sequentially. In addition, on! share of the nicotine pouch category was 17.9%, an increase of 0.5 share point versus the prior year.\nHelix delivered these results while continuing to optimize promotional resources and as on!'s price at retail increased year over year. We believe Helix's ability to grow on!'s volume and share while its retail price is increasing demonstrates on!'s strengthening brand equity among loyal consumers.\nAs a result of responsible brand-building investments, including the new It's on! campaign, consumer impressions of on! grew by nearly five times versus the prior year, exceeding $200 million in Q1. Over the past six months, awareness of the on! brand among current oral nicotine pouch consumers reached over 60%, an increase of 9 percentage points. This year, Helix plans to maintain this momentum by bringing the It's on! campaign to more consumers and focusing on equity investments behind the on! brand in new and existing channels. Let's now turn to the e-vapor category, where the illicit flavored disposable market continues to drive category growth.\nAt the end of the quarter, we estimate the e-vapor category included more than 20 million e-vapors, up over 2.6 million versus a year ago. During the same period, disposable e-vapors increased by an estimated 4 million to approximately 14 million.\nWe estimate that illicit e-vapor products now represent more than 60% of the category. To address the illicit e-vapor issue, we remain focused on advocating for regulatory reforms to accelerate product authorizations and enhance enforcement against illicit actors. We are actively engaging with members of Congress and key administrative staff to highlight the importance of this issue and are urging the new administration and the federal multi-agency task force established last year to take stronger, more coordinated action. We're also supporting state legislative remedies to address illicit e-vapor, including state directories.\nToday, two states have enacted directory legislation this year, and another 21 states have legislation pending. State AGs are also becoming more active. In Q1, 10 state AGs announced various actions, including civil lawsuits, targeted investigations, and warning letters against illicit e-vapor manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.\nIn April, Iowa's AG led a coalition of every Republican state AG in asking the Trump administration to continue combating the flood of illicit e-vapor from China into the US. Let's now turn to NJOY. Since we acquired NJOY in 2023, the e-vapor marketplace has changed significantly to the detriment of legitimate e-vapor manufacturers like NJOY. Unfortunately, in the absence of FDA-authorized flavored choices, many consumers have turned to the illicit market. NJOY has been further challenged by the ITC's exclusion order and cease and desist orders that took effect on 31 March 2024.\nTo comply with the orders, NJOY discontinued the importation of NJOY ACE and ceased shipments to wholesale. These orders are yet another step backwards for the e-vapor category. They severely limit FDA-authorized choices for consumers and undermine public health. NJOY intends to appeal the ITC's decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and our teams continue to work to finalize a product solution that we believe addresses all four patents.\nLooking ahead, we believe it is critical to compete in the e-vapor category with products that align with the evolving expectations of today's consumers. We see the exit of NJOY ACE from the market saturated with illicit products as an opportunity to refine and strengthen our e-vapor product portfolio. To that end, we are combining the talent and capabilities we gained in the NJOY acquisition with our evolved view on today's vapors to broaden NJOY's pipeline of innovative e-vapor products.\nWe continue to believe in the promise of a fully regulated e-vapor category. As I have said before, the FDA has all the resources and tools necessary to accomplish that goal by expediting the authorization process and forcefully enforcing its rules. In the meantime, we are positioning ourselves to re-enter a properly regulated market where we can compete on a level playing field and make significant progress toward our vision. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our business results.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nThanks, Billy. Turning to our Q1 business results, the smokable product segment grew adjusted operating companies income, or OCI, by 2.7%. Adjusted OCI margins were 64.4%, an increase of 4.2 percentage points versus a year ago. This performance was supported by robust net price realization of 10.8%. Total smokable product segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 13.7% in Q1. When adjusted for calendar differences in trade inventory movements, we estimate that our domestic cigarette volumes declined by 12% over the same period.\nAt the industry level, when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences, and other factors, we estimate that domestic cigarette volumes declined by 9%. During the quarter, cigarette industry volume declines remained elevated, partly due to the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and continued discretionary income pressures on consumers.\nSmokers remain under economic pressure due to the compounding effects of inflation exceeding overall wage growth, especially among low-income consumers. Although the year-over-year increases in the rate of inflation moderated in the quarter, high prices on everyday expenses continue to constrain disposable income. As a result, we've seen smokers continue to seek price relief at retail, either within their regular brand or in the form of discount products. In Q1, the discount cigarette segment grew by 1.8 share points. Marlboro retail share declined by one share point versus the year-ago period and 0.3 share points sequentially.\nWithin the highly profitable premium segment, where smoker purchasing behavior tends to reflect high levels of brand loyalty, Marlboro maintained its long-standing leadership in the category. In Q1, Marlboro expanded its share of the premium segment by 0.1 share point to 59.3%, while other competitive brands ceded share. We are encouraged by Marlboro's resilient performance and believe it is a testament to its positioning as the aspirational brand in the category, strong brand loyalty, and PMUSA's RGM and data analytics capabilities.\nPMUSA uses its RGM tools to manage the Marlboro franchise holistically, supporting Marlboro at the state, store, and consumer levels. As I discussed at the CAGNY, national metrics like average price gaps are too generalized to be meaningful and are not reflective of how PMUSA delivers value or manages the business. As a result, beginning in Q1, we are no longer providing the Marlboro price gap versus the lowest effective price in our quarterly metrics. In cigars, reported shipment volume decreased 2.9%. Middleton continued to outperform in the large machine-made cigar industry behind the strength of Black & Mild.\nLet's turn now to the oral tobacco product segment, which delivered over $400 million in total adjusted OCI in Q1. Adjusted OCI margins remained strong at 69.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased 5% as growth in on! was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences in trade inventory movements, we estimate that Q1 oral tobacco product segment volumes declined by approximately 1%. Oral tobacco product segment retail share declined by 3.1 percentage points as declines in our MST brands were not fully offset by continued share growth of on!.\nOverall, we remain encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! grew volume and share in a highly competitive category, and Copenhagen remained a significant contributor to adjusted OCI as the leading moist smokeless tobacco brand for consumers who want a high-quality premium product experience. Let's turn to an update on our e-vapor reporting unit. As Billy mentioned, the ITC orders related to the NJOY ACE went into effect at the end of Q1. As a result, we performed an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $873 million.\nDespite the withdrawal of NJOY ACE from the marketplace, we believe we gained valuable assets and capabilities in the NJOY acquisition that can be applied toward a future e-vapor pipeline that meets consumer preferences over the long term.\nTurning to ABI's financial results, we recorded $146 million of adjusted equity earnings, down 11.5% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a lower ownership interest compared to the year-ago period, reflecting the sale of a portion of our ABI investment. We continue to view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning significant value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. In Q1, we paid approximately $1.7 billion in dividends and repurchased 5.7 million shares for $326 million.\nAt the end of Q1, we had $674 million remaining under our current share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of the year. In addition, our balance sheet remained strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of 31 March was 2.1x, in line with our target of approximately 2x. Let's move now to guidance, where we expect to deliver 2025 full-year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $5.30 to 5.45, representing a growth rate of 2% to 5% from a base of $5.19 in 2024.\nAs noted in today's press release, beginning in Q1, we changed our treatment of our amortization expense associated with definite-lived intangible assets and now excluded from our adjusted results. We believe that operating results adjusted for this item better reflect the underlying performance of our businesses and provide a better comparison to prior operating results. As a result, our guidance reflects a recast of the guidance range and 2024 base. Our growth rate expectation is unchanged.\nOur guidance assumes limited impact on combustible and e-vapor product volumes from enforcement efforts in the illicit e-vapor market and assumes NJOY ACE does not return to the marketplace this year. The guidance range also includes the reinvestment of anticipated cost savings related to our previously announced Optimize and Accelerate initiative and lower expected net periodic benefit income. In addition, our guidance range contemplates limited impact of increased tariffs on our costs, and potential impacts on our consumers based on presently available information about tariffs.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the state of our consumers, including how the economic impact of tariffs could affect their purchasing behaviors. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone at this time. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in a question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Stifel\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nGood morning, Matt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Stifel\n\nBilly, maybe to start, Altria has a unique perspective or a great perspective on the consumer. You talked about some of the macroeconomic pressure the consumer is facing. And when we look at the bridge and the underlying cigarette volume chart that you provide, it looks like the macroeconomic factor is less of an impact relative to the cross-category factors that you're calling out. Can you talk about the current state of the consumer? And are you seeing that inflationary pressure on the consumer play a role in that elevated cross-category movement?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, it's a great question, Matt. We certainly are seeing the consumer under pressure, and we've been noting it for a number of quarters, as you recall. It's the cumulative impact of the inflation. It's not just one quarter standalone. It's the cumulative impact over time. And we are seeing, to your point, in the cross-category, especially to illicit e-vapor, we're seeing pricing from a consumer perspective move up. It's certainly not number one. Flavors are still number one, and the flexibility they have and the amount of choices they have in the marketplace being the number one thing. But price is certainly moving up in that and is becoming a more prominent factor.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Stifel\n\nThank you, Billy. As a follow-up, can you talk about what you're seeing from the consumer that gives you the confidence in continuing to seek pretty robust pricing in the cigarette category? You announced an additional price increase recently. Can you talk about the confidence in the consumer for that pricing, or perhaps it's more flexibility with that pricing to reinvest more in Marlboro to sustain the strong performance you're seeing in the premium segment? Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think it's the key point you had at the end. It's the flexibility. It's a little bit of both. Certainly, the strength of Marlboro, but the tools we have available to us with data analytics and revenue growth management allows us to apply resources where they're needed by the consumer. And you'll recall us describing it. We can do it at the store level. We're certainly in progress to try to do it to the individual level, but we can certainly do it to the store level pretty effectively. And we're pleased with the results Marlboro's had in the marketplace from a market share standpoint.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning, Billy. Good morning, Sal. Three questions from me. One is on the brand you have, Basic. It seems that you have repositioned it down almost to the pricing of Lucky Strike. So I'm picking that data from Nielsen, so maybe my reading isn't correct. But can you just help us understand how you are thinking about approaching the discount segment?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, it's a good question, Gaurav. Look, I wouldn't see it as a strategy shift. This is very common to what we do back through time. If you think about it, when we were increasing the profitability on Basic in our history, we were positioning L&M to capture those smokers that were unable to move up with the price increases on Basic. You're seeing the exact opposite now. As we increased profitability on L&M, we ran some tests with our Basic brand in the marketplace. We were pleased with the test that it was able to capture those consumers that couldn't move up or were unable to move up with the increased price, and we were able to capture them with the brand.\nSo we expanded that as we moved into this year. We are still a premium-focused company. We want to have presence and discount, but we are not interested in growing the discount segment. The profitability is still in the premium segment. You'll recall at CAGNY, and it's still true as we ended Q1, the dollar market share of Marlboro still exceeds its overall market share from a volume perspective.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much. My second question is on on!. So still pretty robust growth, 18% YOY. But clearly, growth has slowed down, and we have the biggest competitor increasing guidance last week. They're more bullish. So do you think there is a risk to on!'s trajectory as we go into the second half of the year? And do you need to pursue a multi-brand strategy, maybe enter synthetic nicotine? So could you just help us understand how you're thinking about on!?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I'll try to disassemble there. There are a couple of questions in there, and I'll try to answer them individually. I think, look, we're pleased with the on!. Some of it's just mathematical. As the base grows, certainly from a percentage standpoint, it's going to slow a bit. But it's a competitive marketplace. We're certainly seeing the entry of various, as you mentioned, synthetic nicotine products into the marketplace with different traits to the consumer, and the consumers are trying those. But we're pleased with it. And I would highlight again back to our pipeline. We're excited for authorization for on! PLUS to bring it to the marketplace.\nCertainly, it was the adult dipper that moved first, and they were desiring something a bit larger from a pouch perspective. And so we're excited to be able to bring on! PLUS. We feel good about on!, and we'll continue to drive its momentum in the marketplace.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. Lastly, on e-cigarettes, so it is clearly a big category, and now you can't sell your devices. So is it that you will just exit the market because that doesn't seem to be a viable strategy long term? So how should we think about you approaching the e-cigarette market here on?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, certainly we can't ship anything after 31 March. So we've seen shipments. Anything that was at wholesale or retail can continue to be sold through. I think your broader question is, what is our strategy in e-vapor? And as we try to express both in this earnings call and at CAGNY, we believe e-vapor is something we need to participate in long term because it has been the most successful in the US converting adult smokers to smoke-free products. From the standpoint, it's important to step back and think about the nature of the marketplace that's currently taking place.\nYou heard in my remarks, over 60% of the market is illicit e-vapor products that completely went around the regulatory process. So we're certainly advocating for quicker authorizations because you can see the success of moving the consumer from smokable or combustible products to smoke-free products that e-vapor has.\nAnd that we need authorizations because the consumer is desiring it, but we also need enforcement for those products that go around the system. Our interest is to learn from the consumer the traits and characteristics of the disposables that they like, enhance our pipeline, and that's where we're investing. Certainly, we're at final design for the last patent that we were found to be infringed upon. We'll continue to challenge in legal. I don't want you to think we're giving up the legal challenges, but we are close to having worked around all of the four patents that we were found to have infringed upon.\nAnd we're excited to bring pods back. But remember, the pod category itself is shrinking. It's disposable that's growing. And so there were traits there, and we've included those traits in our pipeline of products, and are excited to move forward and be able to bring NJOY back to the marketplace.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I'm hoping to hear your perspective on the lost shipment and retail share in the quarter, and maybe how concerned you are, and are further share gains factored into the low end of your guidance. And then, despite the volume and share pressures, you still were able to generate OCI growth smokable, but I think primarily due to the lower legal fees. So just trying to think through this and how you're going to manage some of these factors next year when you lap that.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate your question, Bonnie. I would remind you of our strategy in the combustible segment. Remember, it's to maximize profitability over the long term while balancing investments in Marlboro and the smoke-free categories. And that's exactly what you saw take place in Q1. Certainly, we're going to look at trends over the long term. We're, again, pleased with the way Marlboro is performing in the marketplace with the consumer under extreme economic conditions that they're facing. Certainly, your view towards what you believe will happen in the macroeconomic is a factor.\nAnd when you believe that consumers have experienced enough choices in the e-vapor category, that that potentially slows through time of that conversion over. So those are things that we're thinking about. We certainly think about the strength of the brand, the economic pressures that the consumer is under. But that's where we have the RGM tools to be able to bring those consumers that are under extreme pressure, bring them relief in portions of the Marlboro brand. And so we'll continue to monitor it, especially the tariff impact, as that's a very fluid environment, how that impacts the consumer. But we're pleased with the Q1 results.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a little bit of a follow-on question, but different. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the relative price gaps. I mean, first, I guess I'm curious to hear why you're no longer providing this in your metric sheet. And then second, how are you thinking about the gaps right now, considering they remain very wide between Marlboro, the lowest-priced big brand in the market? I guess, how are you thinking about it in the context of what we were just talking about, the pressures on the consumer and the potential move into recession this year?\nI guess, Billy, essentially, what are you doing to try and prevent further down-training pressures? Just thinking about the share question I asked earlier.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYep. I think I understand your question, but if I answer it wrong, follow up, Bonnie. I think when you think about it, remember, and we've tried to describe this through various interactions with you all and the investor base, is that that price gap that we were showing was a national average. And we're really executing and making decisions in the business at the store level. And that's where the price gap matters. And you'll remember at CAGNY, Sal laid out for you all, here's the price gap of Marlboro in a store. Here's what certain segments of the Marlboro brand and franchise would be at, like Marlboro Black, for instance, in some stores was as low as a price gap of 5%.\nSo we're really monitoring it and executing our RGM tools at the store level. What we came to realize is that we kept getting asked questions about the national price gap, and that's not the way we were managing the business. And so it was causing confusion. So we felt like people were asking about it because we were publishing it, but that wasn't the way we were managing the business and having to explain how we were actually managing the business. And that was the decision to remove it from the quarterly metrics.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Faham Baig with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys. Three questions this morning. Firstly, I appreciate it is very early days, but there have been significant tariffs implemented on products imported from China, which would include the disposable vapes. Have you seen any impact on the imports, availability, and pricing for the disposable vapes from China post these tariffs?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think it's too early to see the true indications of how I think that trend will play out as we progress through the year. Our hope is with revenue dollars available to the government, there will be much more enforcement taking place at the borders. And maybe we're starting to see the green shoots of that a little bit with certain crackdowns at the borders. But certainly with revenue, our hope is that there will be more attention paid to cracking down on these products coming into the US.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nAnd secondly, one of your peers, I noted, recently acquired a portfolio of synthetic disposable vapes that could potentially look to compete with the disposable vapes from China. What is your view on synthetic vape products? And is this an area that Altria could increase activity without having to go around the PMTA filings? Would be interesting to know.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. Certainly, our view on synthetic has evolved through time. As you recall, last with the year-end earnings release, we talked about our view was that synthetic was illegal because of the way the statute was written. It's certainly the indications with the activities from the FDA. It appears they're using enforcement discretion and enforcing against those products. So it certainly moved synthetic nicotine up on our radar. And so we're looking at all available opportunities to assess what's the right move in that direction.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. Maybe the third question is for Sal. The settlement payments in the quarter were down about 20% or $170 million. Anything that you would call out on the drivers behind this and any phasing that may be behind the payments this year?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. Remember, there's a lot of variables that go into the calculation of the MSA and settlement payments. I would point out that there was the expiration of the legal fund. You started to see that in Q4 of last year, and that will continue. So on a comparative basis, you will see that benefit in the first three quarters of this year.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touchstone phone at this time. We'll take our next question from Emma Rumney with Reuters. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nHi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Well, I have a few, if that's all right. The first one is on the tariffs and whether you can see any kind of discernible impact on consumer sentiment in the US as a result of the tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Any color you have on that would be great.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nSure. Good morning. So as I said in my opening remarks, our guidance does consider the impact of tariffs. Remember, we are predominantly a US company with a US-focused supply chain. So while certain materials may be impacted, for example, tin and aluminum that are used in some of our packaging, the impact on our costs are limited, especially compared to other CPG companies and other industries. Of course, we do and will continue to closely monitor the potential impact to our consumers as the year plays out.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. But so far, are you seeing any sort of discernible impact from the tariffs that have been imposed or that are threatened?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. On a cost basis, nothing material. From a consumer standpoint, obviously, they've been under economic pressure for quite a while. A lot of it, the sustained level of inflation that has taken place, the cumulative impact of that. So tariffs, I think, have impacted consumer confidence. You haven't necessarily seen it so much in the everyday items, but everyday items are up just because of inflation. So the consumer's under pressure. It's early days, and we'll see how this plays out throughout the year. It is something we run a lot of scenarios when we're thinking about providing the investment community guidance.\nThere are always puts and takes as the year plays out. I think we are well-positioned to adjust.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nGot it. Thank you. Obviously, on tariffs, there's still a lot of uncertainty around the duration or the rates that will be applied. Could you talk a little bit about how you kind of plan for the long term and in your guidance, whether you're using a particular percentage for tariffs as part of the sort of base case or if yeah, I assume that you're looking at kind of 10% perhaps or 20% on aluminum, but it'd be great if you could talk me through the numbers that you're including in your base case scenario.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nYeah. Yeah. I understand the question. It's a fair question. I'm not going to get into specific numbers and details. What I would tell you is that when you look at the cost of our products, specifically our biggest income generator, the cigarette business, the predominant cost is really driven by federal excise tax, settlement payments, things like that. The cost for materials, leaf conversion is pretty low compared to most CPG companies. So it is something we consider. We have a really terrific supply chain group that is looking at alternative suppliers, and we feel really good about their ability to continue to think about this long term and manage it appropriately.\nSo again, we'll continue to monitor the situation. It is very early days, but we believe that we've got the ability to adjust as time goes on. Again, we'll pay close attention to the impact on the consumer.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nGot it. Thank you. And then last one from me, if I may, on unauthorized vapes. You talked a minute ago about the potential for tariffs to increase enforcement at the border. And that's interesting. But I wondered if more broadly, you've seen any other positive signals from the Trump administration so far and how you interpret the changes that have been either implemented or proposed at the FDA and CTP?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nCertainly, we're hopeful that they take a position of authorizing and enforcing. You heard me earlier say, and you referred to it, certainly with the potential for additional revenue to the US government, we're hopeful that there will be stepped-up enforcement at the borders. But more importantly is exactly where you went, which is the FDA and the CTP, that they take seriously the regulatory act that was passed by Congress. It shows, with these illicit vapes in the marketplace, that the consumer wants to move. So they need to increase their authorization, have a very disciplined process.\nYou remember the act itself called for products to be authorized within 180 days. I can't recall any product even coming close to meeting that deadline. Certainly authorization so that you fill the pipeline with products that the consumer wants, and then enforcement for those that just completely shirk the regulatory process that was laid forth by Congress and the intentions there. We're certainly hopeful. I think we saw some early actions with the removal of the proposed rule for both menthol in cigarettes and flavored cigars. We're hopeful that that activity and momentum continues.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere appears to be no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mac Livingston for any closing remarks.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Altria Group\n\nJust thanks to everybody for joining us and have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO, and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's Q4 and full-year business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics, and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2023. Our remarks contain forward-looking statements, including projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our board of directors. We report our financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.\nToday's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 2024 was another pivotal year for Altria, headlined by meaningful progress toward our vision, strong financial results, and significant cash returns to our shareholders. Our company's leading brands and talented teams enabled our core tobacco businesses to deliver solid income growth and margin expansion, while we strategically invested in our future. For the full year, we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 3.4% and continued our long history of rewarding shareholders with over $10.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases. As the year progressed, our innovative smoke-free products, NJOY and on!, demonstrated encouraging performance through volume and share growth in their respective categories. We hit meaningful milestones that helped solidify our smoke-free portfolio and position us for sustained success in the US.\nNicotine space, including NJOY receiving the first and only marketing-granted orders from the FDA for menthol e-vapor products, submitting PMTA applications to the FDA for next-generation NJOY and on! products, continuing preparations to commercialize Ploom through our joint venture with JT, and advocating for a responsible and well-regulated marketplace, including stepped-up enforcement against illicit market activity. My remarks this morning will focus on our view of the US nicotine space, our smoke-free progress, and our earnings guidance for 2025. I'll then head it over to Sal, who will provide an update on consumer and industry dynamics, further detail on our smokable business, and financial results. Let's begin with the operating environment and our view of the nicotine space. The potential for tobacco harm reduction in the US is significant, and consumers are seeking smoke-free alternatives at a faster pace than we've seen historically.\nIn fact, over the past year, the estimated number of adult consumers in the e-vapor and oral tobacco categories grew to approximately 28 million, nearly as large as the adult smoker population. We estimate that smoke-free alternatives represented approximately 45% of the total nicotine space, up five percentage points from the prior year. For the total nicotine space, industry-equivalized nicotine volumes increased for the second consecutive year and grew by approximately 2% over the past five years on a compounded annual basis. The growing adoption of smoke-free alternatives is encouraging and directly aligned with our vision and the growth aspirations of our smoke-free businesses. In addition, decades of deliberate actions to prevent youth tobacco use are yielding results, and average tobacco usage rates are at historic lows. Together, these trends are very encouraging for public health and the harm reduction opportunity.\nHowever, the primary driver of industry and smoke-free growth continues to be the widespread availability of illicit disposable e-vapor products, which is jeopardizing the long-term opportunity for tobacco harm reduction. We estimate that the e-vapor category grew by approximately 30% in 2024 and that illicit products represent more than 60% of the category. At year-end, we estimate that there were 20 million vapers, up nearly 20% from the prior year, driven exclusively by disposable vapes. Our data also show that approximately 40% of the growth in disposable vapes came from those with no prior cigarette usage. It has become clear that two markets exist in the US: one for those who operate within the regulatory framework and one for those who flagrantly violate and evade the rules. In the simplest, we believe the regulatory structure is broken and the tobacco marketplace is not operating as Congress intended.\nThe FDA has not authorized enough smoke-free products to meet consumer demand with legal products, and regulators are not holding bad actors accountable. Illicit product manufacturers, distributors, and retailers have yet to experience any material consequences for violating federal laws and regulations. This dynamic continues to make the operating environment challenging for responsible manufacturers and retailers, and is confusing for consumers seeking FDA-authorized products. In 2023, we introduced our 2028 enterprise goals to more clearly define where we are headed. We believed our deep understanding of adult tobacco consumers, our comprehensive smoke-free portfolio, and our industry-leading capabilities would help make them a reality. When we established these goals, we were aware of a small illicit e-vapor market, not dissimilar from illicit markets in other tobacco categories throughout our history. However, the illicit e-vapor market has grown to a size and scale beyond our expectations.\nWe believe this dynamic compromises our ability to achieve our 2028 smoke-free volume and revenue goals. In addition, we believe it compromises our ability to achieve the NJOY-specific financial targets we established in connection with that transaction. As a result, we are reassessing these smoke-free goals and NJOY targets and anticipate providing updates when we have more clarity on how the legitimate e-vapor market may evolve. We will be looking for signs of material progress, such as a decline in the illicit growth in the growth of illicit products, a meaningful increase in the number of illicit products prevented from entering the US, and DOJ or state AGs bringing litigation against illicit manufacturers, distributors, and importers. Encouragingly, earlier this month, nine state AGs and the District of Columbia announced various actions against illicit e-vapor importers, distributors, and retailers.\nWe also believe the FDA can restore order to the market by authorizing more PMTAs to establish a legal market of alternatives for consumers, and by partnering with other federal agencies to prevent illicit products from entering the country. I am optimistic that these issues can and will be addressed. Let me be clear. We remain steadfast in our commitment to our vision and to building a portfolio of FDA-authorized smoke-free products for adult smokers and adult consumers currently using smoke-free products. This update to our 2028 enterprise goals does not impact our corporate financial goals or long-term growth goals, and our progress on our goals can be found in the earnings release we issued this morning. Let's now transition to our smoke-free performance, beginning with NJOY.\n2024 was a year of growth and learning for NJOY, and we are pleased with its performance in the context of the broader e-vapor market as NJOY grew volume and share in a competitive pod segment. NJOY's progress was driven by several actions taken throughout the year, which I'll briefly highlight. In 2024, NJOY expanded distribution base to over 100,000 stores, secured premium position at retail in more than 80% of contracted stores through NJOY's first trade program, executed a variety of trial-generating activities with compelling results, and introduced a new brand equity campaign with impactful consumer messaging. As a result of these efforts, NJOY consumables shipment volume grew by more than 15% to 12.8 million units in Q4.\nConsumables shipment volume for the full year was 46.6 million units, and NJOY device shipment volume for the Q4 grew by more than 22% to 1.1 million units and was 5 million units for the full year. In the Q4, NJOY's retail share of consumables was 6.4 share points, up 2.8 share points versus the year-ago period. NJOY grew its share of consumables by 2/10 of a share point sequentially, while the retail price increased by over 20%, indicating strong demand for the brand. Before moving on, I'll mention the litigation before the US International Trade Commission. Yesterday, the ITC issued its final determination in JUUL's case against NJOY. The ITC agreed with JUUL's claims with respect to the four patents in this case. We disagree with the ITC's decision and continue to believe that JUUL's patents are invalid and that ACE does not infringe on these patents.\nAs a remedy, the ITC issued an exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders barring the importation and sale of NJOY ACE. The ITC's decision is currently under a 60-day review period by the Office of the US Trade Representative, which could reject the ITC's decision. NJOY continues work on its product solution that addresses all of the patents at issue in the event the ITC's decision is not rejected. This decision would severely limit FDA-authorized choices, including the only FDA-authorized menthol e-vapor products, and undermines public health, especially in context of a market that is overrun by illicit products. Regarding NJOY's case against JUUL, in December, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial determination finding that JUUL's products did not infringe on NJOY's patents. We have petitioned the ITC to review and reverse the ALJ's initial determination. We expect the ITC to issue a final determination in early April.\nMoving to the oral tobacco category, in Q4, oral nicotine pouches grew 9.6 share points versus the prior year and represented over 45% of the category. Oral nicotine pouches were the primary contributor to the estimated 8% increase in oral tobacco industry volume over the past six months. Helix continued to participate in the category growth as ORN's reported shipment volume grew by more than 44% year-over-year to nearly 44 million cans in Q4. ORN performed well at retail, growing its share of the oral tobacco category by 2 share points year-over-year to 8.9% in Q4. ORN's retail share was unchanged sequentially despite reduced promotional investments and increased competitive pressure. Consumer loyalty for ORN continues to build, and approximately 800,000 consumers regularly purchased ORN in Q4, an increase of more than 40% versus the prior year.\nThis growth included increased sourcing from competitive pouch brands. on!'s performance was enabled by a variety of strategic investments Helix made throughout the year, including a new trade program that created broader visibility and secured premium fixture position for nearly 80% of on!'s volume, and a fresh new look for on! packaging and its own equity campaign to further differentiate the brand. As a result of these efforts, Helix achieved profitability for the first time in Q4 ahead of its 2025 goal, and we anticipate Helix will be profitable for the full year 2025. Outside of the US, on! PLUS is competing in the nicotine pouch space in Sweden and the United Kingdom. In both markets, on! PLUS has been incremental to our total portfolio, sourcing mainly from competitive brands.\nPLUS's FlexTech pouch offers a unique product experience, and we are encouraged by the steady momentum that on! PLUS is building at retail and on e-commerce. We are using consumer insights to inform our plans as we are launching two new flavors, Raspberry Lemon, and Watermelon Nut, in both markets to appeal to evolving consumer preferences. We look forward to bringing on! PLUS to the US once authorized. In heated tobacco, we believe we are developing a portfolio of products that will appeal to adult smokers seeking innovative inhalable alternatives to e-vapor products. We are moving forward with regulatory preparations to bring heated tobacco stick products to the US through Horizon, our joint venture with JT. During 2024, we made great progress towards our PMTA and accelerated our work on an MRTPA submission for Ploom. We now expect to make a combined submission in mid-year 2025.\nIn December, we commenced a small-scale test launch of SWIC, our heated tobacco capsule product, through e-commerce in Great Britain. We expect to use consumer insights from the test to further inform our strategies. Turning to our 2025 financial outlook, we remain committed to tobacco harm reduction in the US and continue to believe there is a significant opportunity to shift millions of smokers to FDA-authorized smoke-free alternatives. Our planned investment areas include market activities in support of our smoke-free products and continued smoke-free product research, development, and regulatory preparations. We believe the external environment will remain dynamic in 2025, and we will continue to monitor the economy, including the cumulative impact of inflation, tobacco consumer dynamics, including purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products, illicit product enforcement, and regulatory litigation and legislative developments.\nConsidering these factors, we expect to deliver 2025 full-year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $5.22 to $5.37. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 2% to 5% from a $5.12 base in 2024. Our guidance includes the impact of one fewer shipping day in 2025, which occurs in the Q1, assumes a limited impact on combustible and e-vapor product volumes from enforcement efforts in the illicit e-vapor market, and includes the reinvestment of anticipated cost savings related to our previously announced Optimize and Accelerate initiative. In addition, the guidance range includes lower expected net periodic benefit income. I'd also like to welcome Rich Stoddard to our Board of Directors as announced this morning. Mr. Stoddard's extensive global marketing and executive leadership experience will be a tremendous asset to Altria.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide additional detail on our business and financial results.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nThanks, Billy. Our core tobacco businesses generated solid financial performance again this year in a challenging external environment. The smokable product segment delivered on its strategy of maximizing profitability while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. The segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by 5.5% in the Q4 and by 2% for the full year. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to 61.2% and 61.6% for the Q4 and full year, respectively. This performance was supported by robust net price realization of 11.3% for the quarter and 10.1% for the full year. Smokable product segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 8.8% in the Q4 and 10.2% for the full year.\nWhen adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, domestic cigarette volumes for the Q4 and the full year declined by an estimated 11%. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8% in the Q4 and 9% for the full year. As Billy described, the pace of change within the nicotine space has been rapid over the past two years. These changes have resulted in significant shifts in adult tobacco consumer preferences, with an increasing number of adult consumers entering the nicotine category primarily through smoke-free products. We have been monitoring these shifts and their effects on cigarette industry decline rates, and are making two updates to our latest cigarette category decomposition estimates.\nFirst, we believe that the cigarette category secular decline estimate of 2.5% represents the impact to cigarette industry volume due to the decline in adult smokers, excluding any cross-category movement. Second, we estimate cross-category impacts contributed approximately 3% to 4% to the cigarette industry decline over the last 12 months. Turning now to share dynamics, total discount segment share grew by 1.7 share points in Q4 and by 1.3 share points for the full year, with most of the growth coming from deep discount. Marlboro retail share of the cigarette category declined one share point in Q4 and 0.3 share points sequentially, consistent with the recent historical seasonality in Q4. Within the highly profitable premium segment, Marlboro expanded its share of premium to 59.4% for Q4, an increase of 0.1 share point year-over-year and sequentially.\nFor the full year, Marlboro grew its share of premium to 59.3%, an increase of 0.4 share points versus the prior year. We believe that Marlboro remains the aspirational brand in the cigarette category, and we are encouraged by its performance in 2024. In cigars, reported shipment volume increased 2.9% in the Q4. Middleton continued to contribute to smokable product segment financial results, and Black & Mild remained the leader in the highly profitable machine-made large-tip cigar segment. The oral tobacco product segment reported strong fourth-quarter results. Adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins increased, and on! grew its retail share of the oral tobacco category year-over-year. For the Q4, adjusted OCI grew 13%, and the segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 69.5%, an impressive increase of 6.4 percentage points versus the prior year.\nFor the full year, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 5.2%, with adjusted OCI margins of 67.8%, up 0.4 percentage points. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 0.4% and 1% for the Q4 and full year, respectively. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volumes were essentially unchanged for the Q4 and declined by an estimated 2% for the full year. Oral tobacco product segment retail share declined by 3.1 percentage points in the Q4, as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by on! share gains. Within the MST category, for the Q4 and full year, Copenhagen remained the undisputed leader. Approximately 1 in every 2 MST cans purchased was a US STC brand. Turning to our investment in ABI, we recorded $159 million of adjusted equity earnings for the Q4, down 8.1% versus the prior year.\nThese earnings reflect the impact of a lower ownership interest compared to the year-ago period due to the partial sale of our ABI investment last year. We continue to view the ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. We demonstrated our commitment to returning significant value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet during 2024. For the full year, we returned over $10.2 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We paid $6.8 billion in dividends, and our board raised our dividend by 4.1% in August, marking our 59th increase in the last 55 years. We also completed our previously authorized share repurchase program, repurchasing 73.5 million shares for $3.4 billion, representing our largest single-year share repurchase in over two decades.\nOur share repurchases were supported by the proceeds from our partial sale of our investment in ABI. We effectively balanced our capital allocation priorities during the year, and we maintained a strong balance sheet. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of 31 December was 2.1 times, in line with our target of approximately 2 times. Moving to 2025, I am pleased to announce that our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touchtone phone at this time. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. We'll take our first question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning. Billy, maybe to start out, the guidance for the year, the 2% to 5% EPS growth, can you talk about the phasing of earnings growth? You have lower MSA costs in the first three quarters, but one less shipping day in the Q1. So just as we consider the shape of the year, can you help us with in terms of phasing?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. You know, Matt, we don't guide to the quarter, but I think as you think about the year, nothing is really distorting in 2024 as we look forward to 2025. You remember 2024 to 2023, we ramped up spending in NJOY because we had a half-year to a full-year ownership of that brand. Nothing like that would stand out for 2025 as we go forward. We did want to highlight the one less shipping day in Q1, so just to make sure people understood that that was occurring in Q1.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Billy. And as my follow-up, the Marlboro continues to perform well in terms of market share of the premium segment, but discount share trends picked back up in Q4. You called out continued discretionary income pressure on adult tobacco consumers. Can you talk about the trends you're seeing in those adult consumers? Is there incremental pressure, or is this continued cumulative impact over time and a mixed shift given the proliferation of cigarette alternatives? And how do you see that playing out through 2025?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. And that's one of the things we'll continue to monitor, Matt, to your point. We do see the cumulative impact really affecting our consumers. And you can see it outside of the tobacco industry. You can see it in credit card late payments, things of that nature, and the amount of credit card debt that consumers are carrying. So the consumer continues to feel that pressure, and it really, we believe, is the cumulative impact of inflation. So we'll see how that shapes up in 2025, but we feel good about the guidance we gave. And as you know, take very many things into consideration before we provide that range. But it is something that we'll monitor.\nAs far as cross-category, we're continuing to see that pressure. We try to highlight that in our decomposition of cigarette industry volume. It really is, and you heard in my remarks, the illicit e-vapor market flooding the market with flavors. If you step back, you can take an optimistic view. It's what we've been saying, that consumers are ready to move if they can find alternatives. We just need a regulatory system that authorizes legal products and enforces against illegal products.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Billy. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Bonnie. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide a little more color on the possible options you have for NJOY. And would a potential settlement with JUUL be on the table?\nI guess, how are you guys thinking about playing in the e-vapor category right now, especially given how the market has evolved with illicit, et cetera? Billy, you did discuss some of this, and also asking, given your comments about no longer being able to hit your targets for NJOY. So is it maybe not worth being in e-vapor right now and possibly better to prioritize and protect the profitability you have in smokable, drive growth, and nic pouches with on!, as well as pursue H&B while at the same time returning cash to shareholders with your strong dividend and buyback program? So just kind of love to hear your thoughts on all of this.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. You brought up a lot of good points, Bonnie. I'll try to give you a concise answer, but if I missed anything or you have follow-up, please do.\nI think when you step back, as far as pathways, there are a number of pathways. There's still some steps in the process. I talked about the review of the trade representative. While that has been, you look back in history, it's been very rare. I think there are special circumstances here. If you think about public health, you have a market that's flooded with illegal vapor products, specifically disposables, that have completely shirked the regulatory process that are in the market, while you have NJOY, which authorized on the tobacco flavors and the only authorized thus far on the menthol side. So when I think you think about that from a public health perspective, I really believe public health and the improvement of public health through time should be a determining factor as we go through that process.\nBut you mentioned settlement, and you mentioned the factors that we'll be considering. One, you need a reasonable party on the other side. We're going to be disciplined about it. When you think about the e-vapor market, the pod segment declining at roughly 15%, you have to be, and we will be, disciplined on what you consider reasonable. I think when you think about what's winning in the marketplace is illegal disposable products. And that's clearly the winner in the marketplace. The brands may change names, but that is what's winning it. So we're certainly taking that into consideration as we consider pipeline products to meet consumer demands in the e-vapor space. There are a number of avenues to continue. We've shared with you previously. We filed SE exemptions for three patents where our engineers worked to not infringe on the patents.\nAnd I think when you come to the bottom line from the patent standpoint, nothing changes that goes into the product, and nothing changes that comes out to the consumer. It's really some modifications to the device itself. And so I'll pause there and see if I hit all of your points, but that's how we're thinking about it.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nNo, I think that's helpful. But to your point about the SEs, I mean, I think what's maybe missing is that fourth, right? And it doesn't solve for the fourth patent, I guess. So I think you're maybe still. I hear you. Right? Okay.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah, I hear you, Bonnie. And our engineers are vigorously working on that final, if you will, change that would allow us not to infringe on the determination made by the ITC.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\nAnd then maybe just another quick question from me just on your guidance. First, I did want to verify that your guidance includes the likely potential you're going to have to pull NJOY ACE from the market at the end of March. I think it does. I just want to double-check. And then second, assuming that happens, is it realistic to think about your ability to hit the high end of your EPS guidance range, or just that being more likely given that NJOY is still operating at a loss and therefore has been a drag on earnings? And if it's pulled, that would actually boost your income this year.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYou know, Bonnie, we run, as you know, a number of scenarios as we're thinking about 2025. There are always puts and takes across the plan, and that's why we provided a range related to the EPS guidance.\nSo we'll see how the year plays out. Obviously, we've got a lot of levers that we can pull to deal with anticipated variability in the marketplace. So we feel good about the guidance we've provided. If there's anything to update as the year progresses, of course, we will. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And we'll take our next question from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. I just have one follow-up and then maybe two actual questions. Just going quickly back to the question on NJOY and the fourth patent that your engineers are furiously working behind.\nIf you are able to successfully navigate that patent and are able to submit an SE application for that, by when do you expect to receive approval for that SE application and thereby you could be able to bring that NJOY product back on the market? The second question that I have was just on the Q4 results. Particularly in the smokable division, your controllable costs in the final quarter was up around 13%, which is a sharp movement, particularly from the previous quarter. Could you just maybe explain the dynamics in the Q4, which resulted into that, as well as how we should think about controllable costs going into 2025? The final question is on nicotine pouches. I was a bit surprised that the oral tobacco category didn't grow faster in 2025 versus—sorry, in 2024 versus 2023, given the rapid growth.\nBut how do you see the growth of nicotine pouches in 2025 and particularly the competitive dynamics from both your legal players as well as some of the illicit ones?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I'll answer the question on the fourth patent and the nicotine pouches, and then I'll answer the one on smokable cost. I think when you think about that fourth patent, it really depends on the final lockdown of the change that we would make to be able to not infringe on the JUUL patent. If it follows the other three, it would be through the SE exemption process. And as you recall, the SE exemption process is the more rapid, while not predictable, a more rapid process to get authorized by the FDA.\nAs far as nicotine pouches, I think as you see introductions of new categories, they always have fits and starts as far as growth, depending on what consumer base they're reaching. I think you saw nicotine pouches grow so rapidly in the introduction because you had the traditional moist smokeless tobacco consumer moving over, who was used to putting, if you will, tobacco or nicotine enjoyment products in their mouth. And so that's intuitive. I think what will continue to grow is if it can speak to and consumers can make the change from other forms of nicotine, such as cigarettes, over to nicotine pouches. And so while we don't guide on volume, we think we have a great product with on!\nWe're looking to on! PLUS to be authorized so that we can bring that to market and continue to engage the consumers to switch them over to smoke-free products.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nYeah. In terms of costs, I think when you look at the Q4, I would just point to timing. I think you got to look at costs over a longer period than just one quarter. So timing definitely a factor in Q4. As far as 2025, we don't guide at that granularity of a level for controllable costs. I will tell you, though, obviously, the smokable category is a declining category. We are going to be disciplined in how we think about resource allocation. I guess one other thing I would point to when it comes to cost management, there are controllable costs.\nAnd then, of course, we are using data analytics and the revenue growth management tools to allow us to be more efficient with how we continue to allocate our promotional resources in support of our cigarette brand. So there's more than just controllable costs when we think about financial discipline.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of Eu Chemicals, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So a few from me. So the first is on on!, the pricing was up nicely in Q4. And despite that, the volume growth remains impressive. So is that something now how we should think of on!, that you can keep pricing up, given especially the spread which still exists with the market leader, and yet your volumes can continue to compound at the rate at which industries join?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I appreciate the question. I think when you think about the nicotine space, it's getting more and more competitive, both with illicit product in the marketplace, as well as what we see is the FDA is applying enforcement discretion against synthetic nicotine products in the marketplace that had followed PMTA, even though it appeared that the statute was pretty clear. So I think their application of enforcement discretion has bled over to the synthetic in that area. I think when you think about ON, I think it's the product itself. It resonates with the consumer. We certainly have gotten a bit sharper with how we put promotional spending in the marketplace. It allows us to continue to generate trial while being able to increase, if you will, the profitability of the product in the marketplace. We were extremely pleased to be able to meet our profitability target ahead of time.\nAnd we'll continue to use data analytics to get sharper to generate trial, but to keep loyalty with the brand as well. And you heard in the remarks, the loyalty percentage of the consumers year-over-year who are returning to purchase on!, we feel like is very impressive.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of Eu Chemicals, Barclays\n\nThank you. And then a follow-up on actually your comment from the synthetic nicotine market. So clearly, your competitors who are not in the synthetic nicotine market, they are seeing the market differently in terms of what the FDA can do or cannot do. So isn't that a market you also want to participate in? Not only on the nicotine pouch side, but also on the e-cigarette side? Because if a lot of new companies have launched products using synthetic nicotine, then you should also be evaluating that.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nCertainly. And we have been evaluating it all along.\nWe were surprised with the application of enforcement discretion in that area based on what we felt like was clarity in the statute when it was passed. But certainly, with them applying enforcement discretion, it's something that's moved up on our radar.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of Eu Chemicals, Barclays\n\nLastly, on the cigarette market share losses, I think we all have discussed it over the years that you want to maximize profitability in cigarettes. But now your share losses are worsening versus where the industry growth rate is. So does that start concerning you at some point of time?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nI think when you back up, Gaurav, we've been highlighting for you that when you look historically, when the consumer's under pressure, they react to their current economic situation, and you see some downtrading that takes place.\nI think when you look at it historically, what you see is we certainly want to give consumers a safe place to stick with Marlboro because Marlboro is the aspirational brand. And you see us apply those tools. I think you see with the growth in premium through time of Marlboro that we've been applying those tools correctly. Certainly, as I highlighted, it's something that we'll continue to monitor. I think the other thing is, as we saw, we've been highlighting for you illicit vape and that whole distribution process. We've been highlighting that it bled over to nicotine pouch, and we're seeing it begin to bleed over into cigarettes as well, as we're seeing, I'll call it white label product, but it's a product that's legal outside of the US, but it's starting to bleed into the US.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of Eu Chemicals, Barclays\n\nThank you so much for taking my questions.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Just wanted to circle back on the EPS guidance for 2025. You called out one less, well, there's obviously one less day in the Q1, but you called out a somewhat lower tax rate and lower pension income. Are there any other items that we should think of? And can you help us quantify the pension income? Just trying to bridge to mid-single digit EPS algo, given you do have a benefit from the tax rate that's kind of offset by the pension income. Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I'll start us off, and then I'll ask Sal to just mention on the tax rate. I think when you think about it, look, every time you start a year, you have puts and takes, and you see that historically through time.\nWhat we tried to highlight is the things that we incorporated into that range of scenarios that we look at for the EPS growth rate. When you think about it, that bunch shipping day is in Q1, but it's a total year impact. When you think about the enforcement, we wanted to highlight from enforcement, we don't really see any impact of stepped-up enforcement in 2025. We mentioned net periodic pension income. That's really just the performance in the marketplace of the asset that's related to the pension investment. And then I'll let Sal speak to the tax rate.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nYeah. And the only thing I would add to the pension is we have a very well-funded pension plan, so we feel really good about the management of the overall defined benefit plan. Tax rate is favorable on a year-over-year basis. You are right to call that out.\nIf you look at the past few years, you have seen variability in the adjusted tax rate. It's been driven by various factors, including tax credits, changes in state taxes, and other business activities. So the guidance we've provided for the tax rate is our best estimate based on the 2025 plans that we've put in place, and we'll continue to monitor it. You also asked about the mid-single digit algorithm. I would tell you, if you think about those goals for EPS, it is a compounded annual growth rate. We knew and we expected there would be some variability year to year as you make an investment in the long-term vision and in the smoke-free product. So we feel really good about the guidance we were able to provide today.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And then hoping to get some color as to what you're seeing in terms of the tobacco consumer.\nIt seems we've seen a modest pickup or a moderate pickup in sort of low-end consumer spending in the convenience channel, kind of from the depths of the summer to kind of October and then post-election. We've seen a number of other categories in the channel overall. Wondering if you have any color as to what you're seeing with respect to your consumer in those channels?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I mean, there are always headwinds and tailwinds. I would tell you that the biggest headwind is the cumulative impact of inflation. When you look historically, and I mentioned this earlier, our consumer specifically is at the lower end of the socioeconomic status. And so they react immediately to their current economic situation. If things stay steady for a period of time, they adjust to that. It's been this cumulative impact of inflation that they haven't been able to adjust to.\nAnd that's why we highlighted, look, we'll continue to watch the economy and that impact of cumulative inflation. If it continues to compound, we would expect our consumer to stay under pressure. If it will moderate, we expect the consumer to be able to adjust to that through time. And that's what we'll continue to watch.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\nThank you. We'll take our last question from Emma Rumney with Reuters. Your line is open.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nHi guys. Thanks a lot for doing the call and the opportunity to ask questions. I wanted to hear a little bit about your expectations for policy changes under the new administration. So first of all, on combustibles, obviously, the menthol ban has been scrapped. What about the proposed nicotine cap? Do you see any prospect of that being picked up by the Trump administration?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. We'll wait and see on that. We will certainly be excited to hear the outcome of that. I would remind you that that was a proposed rule at the time. We see it as completely technically not feasible. And we provided detailed comments to the FDA. And we really believe that the future should be harm reduction. And you heard me mention in my remarks earlier, we believe the regulatory system is broken and really not functioning the way Congress intended. If you step back and think about what that regulatory system was designed to do, it was to have a third party look at the science, authorize products, and enforce against illegal products. And none of that is really happening to any scale thus far.\nSo what I believe we expect from the current administration is that they will look at this and really get the agency functioning the way it was intended to function.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nYeah. Okay. Well, that was kind of my next question on the policy around vapes or new nicotine products and the FDA's approach. I mean, it sounds like you think the sort of change in administration is an opportunity to sort of push for some change. What kind of possible scenarios do you think they're considering, or are you sort of preparing for?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. What we would like to see is that very similar to what I just mentioned, which is an agency. We know that the adult cigarette consumer, at least slightly over half of them, are looking for alternatives that satisfy them.\nAnd so what we need is an agency that is diligent, but expedient on authorizing products, and an agency that enforces against illicit products in the marketplace. I think you can go to a majority of the states across the US and see a plethora of these products that have just basically thumbed their nose at the agency and the federal government and are being sold throughout the US. And so you need better authorization of legal products and enforcement against illegal. That's what we would be looking for. We think that sets the US up for harm reduction through time.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nYeah. And is there a risk, though, that the administration could just say, \"Let's just scrap this PMTA process altogether?\" If the FDA can't meet its own deadlines, sort of if you've got a pending application, go ahead and mark it kind of thing? Is that a threat?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nWe would certainly prefer, as we supported the FDA all along, passing of it as it was intended, is that you have a third party really regulate the marketplace so that you have manufacturing standards, you have science standards for legitimate products in the marketplace. And so we would continue to want to see the FDA have authority over nicotine products in the marketplace so it doesn't turn into what we were seeing in the e-vapor market early on, which is a wild, wild west, and continues because of lack of enforcement. We just need an agency to function as it was proposed to function.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. And just lastly, the other sort of policy uncertainty is around tariffs, which I assume would impact Altria's vaping business mostly, although correct me if I'm wrong on that point.\nIt'd be great to know if there would be an impact there, how you might be able to mitigate it. Would it be through price, or could you do anything in terms of shifting production? It'd just be great to know what options you're considering if tariffs do come into force.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. There's been a lot of tariffs mentioned in the media. I haven't seen any past. I think if you're referring to e-vapor, we've heard some comments where everything is forced out of China. We would have limited impact to any tariffs that were put in place on China.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. Sorry, could you explain why? Because I thought NJOY was produced in China, but again, I might be wrong.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nNo, we actually have alternative production facilities that we utilize that are outside of China.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. Is that in Indonesia?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I'm not going to get into specifics for competitive reasons, but we have other manufacturing facilities around the globe.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Reuters\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. There appears to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mac Livingston for any closing remarks.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nCompany Representative, Altria\n\nGreat. Thanks to everybody again for joining us, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session representative of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Savanna. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's second quarter and first half business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com.\nDuring our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2023. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nToday's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.\nFinally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Altria's momentum continues to build as we pursue our vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. In the second quarter, our company's innovative smoke-free products delivered strong share and volume performance. And we hit meaningful milestones that we believe set us up for future success.\nNJOY received the first and only marketing granted orders from the FDA for menthol e-vapor products. And we submitted PMTA applications to the FDA for next-generation NJOY and on! products. Our traditional tobacco businesses remained resilient despite a challenging operating environment. Our [ highly ] cash-generative businesses supported continued investments in our innovative product efforts, and we returned significant value to shareholders during the first half of the year, with more than $5.8 billion delivered to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we believe our dedicated teams have us on track to deliver against full year financial guidance.\nThis morning, my remarks will focus on NJOY's encouraging second quarter results, the state of the e-vapor category, illicit market activity and enforcement actions and strong second quarter results from on! I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further detail on our financial results, including our outlook, the performance of our traditional tobacco businesses and capital allocation.\nLet's begin with the e-vapor category. In June, we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of welcoming NJOY into the Altria family of companies. Since that time, we've combined our industry-leading capabilities with enjoys competitive product offering and are thrilled with the progress we've made. Let me briefly recap some of our accomplishments. We strengthened NJOY's supply chain to enable our expansion plans. Tripled NJOY's retail footprint to over 100,000 stores, secured premium positioning at retail and more than 80% of contracted stores through NJOY's first trade program. Launched a variety of trial-generating activities with compelling results and introduced a new brand equity campaign with impactful consumer messaging. As a result of these efforts, NJOY saw continued traction at retail during the second quarter and first half as evidenced by volume momentum and share growth. NJOY consumables shipment volume was approximately 12.5 million units for the second quarter and 23.4 million units for the first half. NJOY's device shipment volume was approximately 1.8 million units for the second quarter and 2.8 million units for the first half. Both consumables and device shipment volumes increased sequentially with consumables increasing by 14.7% and devices by 80%.\nTo generate trial in the second quarter, NJOY paired equity messaging how about its attractive product proposition with promotional support and saw compelling results at retail. For the second quarter, NJOY's retail share of consumables was 5.5 share points, up 1.3 share points sequentially. NJOY's retail share of consumables grew in each of the past 9 months. We're also encouraged by NJOY's device share which we believe is an important indicator of trial and a potential leading indicator of longer-term adoption. As a result of trial focused investments in the second quarter, NJOY expanded its share of devices in the multi-outlet and convenience channel to 25.4 share points, more than doubling its share of devices sequentially. We plan to continue investing behind NJOY's value proposition and equity to build awareness and generate trial.\nAt retail, approximately 2/3 of fixture resets are now complete, and we've amplified NJOY's visibility and secured premium positioning through its trade program. NJOY is also reaching increased numbers of adult consumers through its [ events ] infrastructure and digital marketing programs. Through these engagements and NJOY's equity campaign, we can continue to position NJOY as a competitive alternative for adult smokers and vapors to responsibly grow NJOY over the long term.\nOn the regulatory front, in June, NJOY received marketing granted orders from the FDA for four menthol e-vapor products. NJOY has the first and only menthol e-vapor products authorized by the FDA, a significant accomplishment for the NJOY team and a testament to the quality of NJOY's robust science and evidence-based applications. Under the terms of our acquisition of NJOY, on receiving these authorizations, we made cash payments totaling $250 million in July. Now all end market NJOY products are covered by marketing granted orders from the FDA.\nIn addition, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which incorporates access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use. NJOY also resubmitted PMTAs for blueberry and Watermelon pod products that work exclusively with the 2.0 device. These submissions mark further milestones in pursuit of our vision. And NJOY looks forward to responsibly providing flavored e-vapor options for adult smokers and vapers once authorized.\nNJOY's momentum, and the results are even more encouraging in the context of the broader e-vapor category, which continues to be overrun by illicit disposable products due to a lack of effective regulation and enforcement. At the end of the second quarter, we estimate the e-vapor category included approximately 19 million vapors, up over 3 million vapors versus a year ago. During the same period, disposable vapors increased by $4 million to approximately 12 million vapors.\nThrough the first half of 2024, we estimate the category grew by approximately 40%, driven by illicit flavored disposable products which we believe now represent more than 60% of the category. We estimate pod-based volumes declined by approximately 15% in the first half of 2024. And now represents approximately 15% of category volumes. We are beginning to see the robust supply chains and lack of enforcement that supports the illicit e-vapor market, enable increased illicit activity across multiple tobacco categories, including nicotine pouches and cigarettes that are available to U.S. consumers. In fact, we've identified more than 350 illicit nicotine [ pouch ] SKUs across both retail and e-commerce, with new brands launching every month. This illicit market echoes the beginning of their illicit e-vapor market several years ago.\nIn addition, we believe illicit cigarettes are becoming more prevalent in the U.S. and are evading regulation and taxation. We periodically conduct discarded [ PAC ] studies in select geographic markets. One such study in California found more than 25% of discarded cigarette packs were nondomestic products, originating primarily from duty-free channels and China. The FDA's inaction, lack of enforcement and slow pace of smoke-free authorizations continues to enable bad actors who are lately disregarding regulations. For our part, we continue to actively engage with regulators, federal and state lawmakers, our trade partners and other stakeholders to build awareness of these issues and drive marketplace enforcement. This month, we sent the FDA data that supports our increasing concern that illicit market actors are expanding into the nicotine pouch category. Our hope is that this information demonstrates the need for the FDA to direct enforcement actions against illicit nicotine pouch products in addition to illicit e-vapor products. We believe it is critical that the FDA acts decisively to regain control over the oral nicotine pouch category to prevent another widespread illicit market from taking hold.\nAt the federal level, we saw some positive actions in the second quarter. For example, in June, the Justice Department and the FDA announced the creation of a federal multi-agency task force, which is expected to coordinate and streamline efforts to bring all available criminal and civil tools to bear against the illegal distribution and sale of e-vapor products. We have been advocating for multi-agency collaboration and view this announcement as a much-needed course correction for enforcement efforts. In addition, we continue to see other actions at the federal level, including e-vapor related import refusals, civil monetary penalties and warning letters issued to manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers of illicit products.\nIn the absence of effective FDA enforcement to date, many states are stepping up to address this issue. As of today, 11 states have passed legislation requiring manufacturers to certify that they are compliant with FDA requirements and 4 states are considering similar legislation. Enforcement has started in 4 states with the balance set to begin in the second half of 2024 and 2025. When properly implemented and comprehensively enforced, we believe state registry bills can be effective.\nWe continue to believe in the promise of a responsible and fully regulated tobacco industry. As we stated in the past, regulation without enforcement is indistinguishable from no regulation at all. We're hopeful to see more meaningful action and enforcement activity over the next year.\nLet's turn back to the oral tobacco category where all nicotine pouches grew 12.3 share points year-over-year and now represent nearly 42% of the category. All nicotine pouches were the primary contributor of the estimated 9% increase in oral tobacco industry volume over the past 6 months. Helix participated in the category growth, growing on reported shipment volume by 37% to 41 million cans during the second quarter. Helix continues to invest strategically and responsibly behind on!\nThis spring, Helix launched a new trade program that secured the #1 retail fixture position for nearly 80% of on!'s volume, creating broader visibility of the on! brand. And in June, Helix introduced a fresh new look for on! packaging and a new equity campaign, it's to further differentiate the brand.\nEncouragingly, we saw consistent on! share momentum throughout the quarter. on!'s retail share grew in each of the past three months to 8.1% for the quarter, an increase of 1.2 share points versus the prior year and a 1 share point sequentially. Helix remains focused on long-term profitability and delivered these impressive results while reducing on! promotional spending year-over-year. We are very excited about the prospects and potential for on! PLUS, an innovative pouch product made using our proprietary \"soft-feel\" material, which is designed for adults to dip and dual users with cigarettes.\nEarly international results continue to show that on! PLUS is a growing competitive player in the nicotine pouch space in Sweden and the United Kingdom. In both markets, on! PLUS has been incremental to our photo portfolio, sourcing mainly from competitive brands with minimal cannibalization. In Sweden, levels of trial are increasing, and e-commerce repurchase rates are strong, above 30%. Supported by these results, we expanded on! PLUS distribution beyond e-commerce into 2,000 key retail accounts in Sweden, including [indiscernible] and [ ICA ].\nIn the U.K., following the launch of on! PLUS, the on! portfolio is the #2 brand in e-commerce. And Helix recently secured on! PLUS distribution in 1,000 retail stores. Consumer feedback indicates that consumers enjoy the innovative on! PLUS pouch and view it as a unique point of differentiation in the category.\nTurning back to the U.S. market. Helix submitted PMTAs to the FDA for on! PLUS in June. These PMTAs were submitted for three varieties: Tobacco, Mint and Wintergreen, each in three different nicotine strength options. We believe our innovation in the nicotine pouch space can be a meaningful contributor to our smoke-free goals once authorized in the U.S.\nIn summary, it was an exciting quarter for Altria. We made significant progress towards our vision with in-market products and achieved important milestones to prepare for future success. We're confident in the long-term outlook for our smoke-free portfolio and we have a significant opportunity to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. I believe we have the appropriate strategies in place to execute our growth plans, and I want to thank all of our employees who continue to work tirelessly to make our vision become a reality.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Billy. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was unchanged in the second quarter and declined by 1.6% for the first half. Our first half results were consistent with our expectations. For 2024, adjusted diluted EPS growth weighted to the second half due to the timing of the NJOY acquisition in June 2023 and the impact of two additional shipping days in the second half of the year. Therefore, we are narrowing our full year 2024 guidance range and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $5.07 to $5.15, representing a growth rate of 2.5% to 4% from a base of $4.95 in 2023.\nLet's turn to an update on consumer and industry dynamics. Cigarette industry shipment volumes remained pressured during the second quarter and first half, due primarily to macroeconomic factors and the growth of illegal disposable e-vapor products. While the rate of inflation has stabilized in recent months, we believe adult smokers remain under economic pressure as the cumulative impacts from prolonged inflation persists and constrained discretionary spending. Late last year, we share our estimate that the growth of illegal disposable e-vapor products contributed to cigarette industry declines in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% and committed to continue evaluating this dynamic trend.\nAs we've continued to see elevated growth of illicit e-vapor due to lack of enforcement, we believe that cross-category movement has been higher in recent quarters than our previously estimated range. We estimate that cross-category movement from cigarettes primarily to illicit disposable e-vapor products contributed an estimated 2% to 3% of the cigarette industry decline over the last 12 months and have reflected these updates in our decomposition of cigarette industry decline rates. We will continue to monitor the illicit e-vapor market and provide updates as we enhance our estimates in this space.\nIn the smokeable products segment, our strategy continues to maximize profitability over the long term while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. Segment adjusted operating companies income declined by 2% to $2.8 billion in the second quarter and by 2.3% to $5.3 billion in the first half. As we look to the second half of the year, in addition to the two additional shipping days, I'll remind you of the expiration of legal fund payments related to the master settlement agreement in the fourth quarter, which we previously disclosed in our 2023 10-K. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to 61.6% for the second quarter and 61% for the first half. This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 9.9% for the quarter and 9.3% for the first half.\nMarlboro continued to be the undisputed category leader with a retail share of 42% in the second quarter, down 110 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially. Within the premium segment, Marlboro expanded its share to 59.4%, an increase of 0.7 share points versus the prior year and 110 sequentially.\nThe Smokeable Products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 13% in the second quarter and 11.5% for the first half. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, smokeable products segment domestic cigarette volumes for the second quarter and the first half declined by an estimated 11% and 10.5%, respectively. At the industry level, when adjusted for trade inventory movements, second quarter domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 9.5%. For the first half, when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette industry volumes declined by 9%. The discount segment grew one share point year-over-year and 210 sequentially in the second quarter. We believe these results were driven in part by macroeconomic pressures on adult smokers and competitive activity.\nIn cigars, reported shipment volume decreased 0.9% in the second quarter. Middleton continued to contribute to smokable products segment financial results and Black & Mild remained the leader in the highly profitable, machine-made large cigar segment.\nMoving to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI grew by 1.8% in the second quarter and 3.1% for the first half. Adjusted OCI margins decreased by 2.4 percentage points for the second quarter and 1.2 percentage points for the first half, as Helix continued to invest in the growing oral nicotine pouch category. Reported shipment volume decreased 1.8% for the second quarter and 2.5% for the first half as [indiscernible] growth was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, we estimate that second quarter and first half oral tobacco products segment volumes declined by approximately 3% and 3.5%, respectively. Oral Tobacco Products segment retail share was 37.9% for both the second quarter and first half as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by the growth of on!\nEvolving consumer preferences and the accelerated growth of oral nicotine pouches have continued to impact MST products. As a result, we determined that the estimated fair value of the [ school ] trademark at June 30, 2024, was below its carrying value and recorded a noncash pretax impairment of $354 million. Despite this, we remain encouraged by the resilience of Copenhagen, the long-standing #1 brand in MST, and the continued growth of on! in nicotine pouches, which surpassed [ goal ] to become our second largest oral tobacco brand at retail.\nTurning to ABI's financial results. We recorded $145 million of adjusted equity earnings for the second quarter, up 9.8% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we used the equity method of accounting for our investment in ABI and report our share of ABI's results using a one quarter lag. Accordingly, our second quarter adjusted equity earnings represent our share of ABI's first quarter earnings reduced by our lower ownership percentage following the partial sale of our ABI investment, which occurred late in the first quarter. Lastly, on capital allocation. We returned significant value to shareholders during the first half of the year, supported by the partial sale of our investment in ABI, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed during the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion remaining under our currently authorized share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year. We also paid $3.4 billion in dividends, resulting in total cash return to shareholders of $5.8 billion for the first half.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of June 30 was 2.1x, in line with our capital structure goal of approximately 2x. As we continue to execute on our vision, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nWith that, we'll wrap up. and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period.\nOperator, do we have any questions?",

We report our financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We made meaningful progress in pursuit of our vision, and our highly profitable traditional tobacco businesses continue to perform well in a challenging environment. In spite of the absence of an effective regulatory environment, we saw continued early momentum from NJOY and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against full-year plans. We also demonstrated our continued commitment to maximizing the return on our investments and delivering strong shareholder returns with the sale of a portion of our investment in ABI and the subsequent expansion of our share repurchase program in March.\nMy remarks this morning will focus on the continued early momentum behind NJOY's commercialization, the state of the e-vapor category, and enforcement progress, encouraging Q1 results from on! and our financial outlook.\nI'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further detail on our financial results and additional information on the partial sale of our ABI investment. Let's begin with our e-vapor business. After three full quarters of ownership, we remain excited about NJOY and its potential in the legal US e-vapor market. In Q1, we broadened NJOY's distribution to over 80,000 stores, and we expect to expand to approximately 100,000 stores by year-end. We also continued the rollout of NJOY's first retail trade program, which we believe will help NJOY achieve optimal visibility and product fixture space at retail.\nToday, more than 70% of contracted stores have chosen options that secure premium positioning in the e-vapor fixture for NJOY, and we expect the majority of fixture resets to be completed in the first half of this year.\nTo generate trial of NJOY, we expanded promotional offers at retail in Q1 and saw promising results. NJOY's retail share of consumables grew in each of the past six months and was 4.3 share points in the quarter, up 0.6 share points sequentially. We have seen early signs of longer-term adoptions from smokers and vapers that have tried NJOY. Late last year, we tested a variety of promotional offers in a limited number of retail accounts.\nDiving into one retail account example, share grew by over 9 percentage points versus the pre-promotional period. In Q1, we reduced promotions in the account, and NJOY retained over 50% of the share gain during the trial period, settling 5 percentage points higher than the pre-promotion period. We believe these results speak to NJOY's appeal once consumers try the product.\nWe are also inspecting a variety of other metrics to better evaluate trial and adoption of NJOY in the early stages of its expansion. One such metric that we believe is an important indicator of trial in the e-vapor category is retail share of devices, as we believe it's a measure of vapor and smoker trial and a potential leading indicator of longer-term adoption. In Q1, NJOY's share of devices in the multi-outlet and convenience channel was 11.5 share points, an increase of 2.4 share points sequentially and 6.4 share points since Q3 of 2023, our first full quarter of ownership.\nTurning to shipments, NJOY consumables shipment volume was approximately 10.9 million units, and NJOY's device shipment volume was approximately 1 million units. While shipment volume was essentially flat sequentially, recall that 2023 Q4 NJOY shipment volume included building pipeline inventory at wholesale and retail to support the increased demand we anticipated in Q1.\nMoving forward, our plan aims to broaden the awareness of NJOY and grow brand affinity through NJOY's improved positioning at retail, a new equity campaign that emphasizes NJOY's unique attributes and exceptional vaping experience, a new adults-only event marketing infrastructure, which NJOY expects to activate this summer, and our adult tobacco consumer database, which allows us to communicate to millions of age-verified US adult tobacco consumers through various marketing channels. We also continue to expect that NJOY will submit PMTA filings for flavored NJOY ACE products with age-gated Bluetooth technology by the end of Q2.\nNJOY's early success is encouraging in the context of broader trends in the e-vapor`` marketplace, where a lack of FDA-authorized products and the continued proliferation of illicit disposable products threaten the harm reduction opportunity in the United States. As it relates to enforcement, we believe that a comprehensive approach is needed to address this issue, and we continue to actively engage with regulators, state and federal lawmakers, our trade partners, and other stakeholders to build awareness and drive marketplace enforcement. There is still significant work ahead, but we saw some encouraging actions in Q1.\nIn Q1 alone, the FDA, in collaboration with the US Customs and Border Protection, issued over 450 e-vapor-related import refusals, up from 348 during all of last year. The agency also continued to levy civil monetary penalties and send warning letters to manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers of illicit products.\nWhile these actions represent signs of progress, we believe they are wholly inadequate. Illicit markets are a threat to public health, and we believe the FDA's enforcement approach is not of the scale or scope needed to bring about fundamental change in the marketplace. As a result, we identified to the agency specific steps we believe they can take to build a more effective, compliant, and enforcement program to address the illicit market, including imposing direct liability on the large manufacturers, importers, and distributors of illicit products, focusing on import prevention, and clearing up widespread confusion in the marketplace about the FDA's enforcement priorities.\nEarlier this month, we sent a letter to the FDA highlighting these recommendations and reinforcing our commitment to work collaboratively on solutions that can restore order in the e-vapor marketplace. We also continue to work with state legislatures that have passed or are considering legislation requiring manufacturers to certify that they are compliant with FDA requirements.\nAs of 19 April 2024, eight states have passed such legislation, and 12 states are considering it. We've seen increased legal action against entities that are enabling the illicit market. As we've previously disclosed, we initiated litigation in the United States District Court in California relating to the sale of unlawful products. Due to some procedural challenges, we voluntarily dismissed this litigation earlier this year. We subsequently filed a new lawsuit against five manufacturers, four brick-and-mortar retailers, and three online retailers of illicit ELFBAR e-vapor products in February in federal court in California.\nEarlier this month, the city of New York filed a lawsuit against 11 wholesalers for their part in the sale of illegal disposable e-vapor products. We continue to believe in the promise of a responsible e-vapor category, but a strong course correction is needed to protect the tobacco harm reduction opportunity for the millions of adult smokers in the US. We've learned from past experience that complex issues like this require the work of many stakeholders. While we are starting to see some early signs of action, more impactful progress needs to be made.\nLet's now turn to the oral tobacco category. Oral nicotine pouches grew 13.8 share points year-over-year and now represent over 40% of the oral tobacco category. Oral nicotine pouches were the primary contributor of the estimated 9.5% increase in oral tobacco industry volume over the past six months. Helix grew on!'s reported shipment volume to approximately 33 million cans during Q1, an increase of 32%. on! continued its momentum at retail, growing its share of the oral tobacco category by 0.7 share points to 7.1%. Helix delivered these impressive results as on!'s retail price increased by 26%.\nThis spring, Helix introduced a new trade program that secures premium positioning for on! in over 80% of contracted stores, creating broader visibility of the brand. Helix is continuing its focus on strategically investing behind the brand as the category growth accelerates. Helix is also making final preparations for filing its PMTA for on! PLUS, which we expect to submit in the first half of this year. Upon FDA authorization, we believe it will contribute meaningfully to Helix's growth. We continue to aggressively pursue efforts to create the conditions for tobacco harm reduction success in the US to benefit tobacco consumers, society, and our shareholders.\nI am confident in Altria's ability to lead the way in harm reduction with our exciting portfolio of smoke-free products and our talented and dedicated employees. With our smoke-free progress and the strength of our traditional tobacco businesses in mind, we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to 5.17, representing a growth rate of 2% to 4.5% from a base of $4.95 in 2023. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more details on the business environment and our results.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nThanks, Billy. Q1 adjusted diluted earnings per share declined by 2.5%. As we previously noted, we expect that 2024 adjusted diluted EPS growth will be weighted to the second half of the year, resulting from two main factors. The first relates to the timing of the NJOY acquisition in 2023. Since we closed the transaction on `1 June` of last year, we are lapping quarters in the first half of the year that do not include the impact of amortization or investments behind the brand.\nThe second factor is the impact of two additional shipping days in the smokable segment, each of which occur in the second half of the year. Turning now to our Q1 business results, the smokable product segment delivered over $2.4 billion in adjusted operating companies income, with robust net price realization of 8.5%, and Marlboro maintained its long-standing leadership in the cigarette category. Adjusted OCI margins were 60.2% for the quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Year-over-year margin comparisons were impacted by higher per-unit settlement charges and some elevated manufacturing costs.\nYear-over-year MSA and manufacturing costs per pack increases were higher in Q1 than we expect for the remainder of the year. These higher costs were partially offset by lower SG&A costs in the quarter. We also expect the segment to benefit from lower SG&A costs as the year progresses. Total smokable product segment reported and adjusted cigarette volumes declined by 10% in Q1. When adjusted for trade inventory movement and other factors, we estimate that industry volumes declined by 9% over the same period.\nWe believe that industry volume trends have been negatively impacted by the proliferation of illicit disposable e-vapor products and continued pressures on tobacco consumer discretionary income. At retail, the discount segment grew 0.8 share points in Q1. We believe these results were driven in part by macroeconomic pressures on the adult smokers. We continue to see increased competitive activity in the discount segment, including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.\nMeanwhile, Marlboro continues to show its resilience, retaining its retail share of 42% in a challenging environment. Marlboro also grew its share of the highly profitable premium segment to 59.3%, an increase of 0.7 share points. We believe Marlboro's strong consumer loyalty and position as the aspirational brand in the category is driving its continued outperformance in the premium segment.\nIn cigars, reported cigar shipment volume decreased by 6.1% in Q1. Middleton continued to contribute to smokable products segment financial results, and Black & Mild remains the leader in the highly profitable machine-made large cigar segment. Moving to the oral tobacco product segment, adjusted OCI grew 4.6% in Q1, and adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.2 percentage points to 69.5%.\nTotal segment reported shipment volume decreased 3.1% as growth in on! was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, we estimate that Q1 oral tobacco product segment volumes declined by approximately 4%. Oral tobacco product segment retail share declined 7.1 percentage points as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by the growth of on!. We remain encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! continued to grow share, and Copenhagen remained the leading moist smokeless tobacco brand.\nMoving to capital allocation, in March, we sold a portion of our investment in ABI and expanded our share repurchase program to $3.4 billion. In expanding our repurchase program, we implemented a $2.4 billion accelerated share repurchase program under which we received 46.5 million shares in March, representing 85% of the ASR program.\nThese repurchases are reflected in our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter. We expect to receive shares representing the remaining 15% of the ASR program by the end of Q2. After the completion of the ASR program, we anticipate having $1 billion remaining under the currently authorized share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by year-end. Turning to ABI's financial results, we recorded $165 million of adjusted equity earnings for the quarter, down 8.3%. As a reminder, we use the equity method of accounting for our investment in ABI and report our share of ABI's results using a one-quarter lag.\nAccordingly, our Q1 adjusted equity earnings represent our share of ABI's Q4 earnings. Following the ABI transaction, our ownership of ABI is approximately 8.1%, with a tax basis of approximately $1.2 billion.\nWe continue to view the ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. Turning to other capital allocation activity, we paid approximately $1.7 billion in dividends and retired $1.1 billion of notes that came due in Q1. As of 31 March 2024, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And once again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone at this time. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question will come from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nTobacco and Packaged Food Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good m`orning.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nGood morning, Pamela.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nTobacco and Packaged Food Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI wanted to ask about the modest raise to your full-year guidance following the ABI share sale, despite your plans to repurchase an incremental 3% of your stock. What considerations went into that? And is it a reflection of weaker-than-expected underlying performance relative to your outlook at the beginning of the year?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nGood morning, Pamela. Thanks for the question. We were really happy to be able to revise our guidance and take up the bottom end of the guidance by a full percentage point. We took the top end of the guidance up about a half a percentage point. I would read into that the confidence in our core businesses, but also it provides us with flexibility as we go throughout the year to manage not only our overall business but to make investments behind our innovative tobacco products. So we feel really good about being able to provide the guidance. It reflects the accretion of the ABI transaction.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nTobacco and Packaged Food Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks. And my second question is a bit more philosophical. Historically, your strategy has been to maximize operating profit by taking price in excess of cigarette volume declines. And given this is becoming increasingly difficult because of the magnitude of volume declines and the need to reinvest behind alternatives, do you think that this strategy is sustainable in the changing operating backdrop? And have you considered other approaches to maximizing profitability?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. We always look at our strategies, Pamela, but we feel like that is the right strategy. I would phrase it a little bit differently than you did. It's to maximize profitability over the long term while making appropriate investments in Marlboro and the growth segment. So when you think about that, I think when you think about the pricing, and we've talked about the factors that go into pricing decisions, certainly we've highlighted for you that our consumer is under economic strain, both from the cumulative impact of inflation, as well as debt loads, and high interest rates.\nAnd so we're going to continue to maximize profitability over the long term. We feel good about the price realization we had in the quarter. It was 8.5%. I think it's important to step back and think about what the consumer felt at retail. And so when you think about that, that was just shy of 6%. So there's still competition out there, but our consumer is under pressure, and we're going to make appropriate investments and be there for them. I think if you look back through history, that's proven to be a strong strategy.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nTobacco and Packaged Food Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you. I'll pass it off.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nAll right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a bit of a follow-up question to Pamela. Just one thing I certainly saw in the quarter was your controllable costs and smokable per pack were up quite a bit, I think up mid-teens. So hoping you could touch on the drivers of that and how we should think about that moving forward. And then honestly, just ultimately your expectations for improved dollar profit growth in smokable in the back half.\n\nOperator\n\nI guess I'm trying to understand, can you guys hit the mid to high end of your EPS guidance this year if dollar profits don't recover? Again, kind of a little bit of what Pamela was asking, but just trying to understand how much flexibility you have.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nGood morning, Bonnie. I'm going to unpack that question a little bit. Hopefully, I touch on all aspects of it. If I don't, please follow up.\nAs we talked about in our opening remarks, I think Q1, there's a couple of items that I would point out. It's really about comparisons to prior year that impact the Q1 at a higher level than we think will impact the rest of the year. A couple of adjustments, if you will, accounting adjustments as you think about. One is within the MSA cost per pack. We've seen adjustments in the past. There's a lot of variables. It's a complex calculation when you develop the accrual for MSA. And in the past, you've seen adjustments related to things like inflation.\nThis quarter, we did make an adjustment. It was really specific to industry profits. Specifically, one of our major competitors had lower profits than anticipated.\nThen on the cost side, not to get too deep into the accounting, but we do account for inventory and the LIFO methodology. When you revalue the inventory, it does impact the P&L, and it impacts the P&L in the Q1 at a higher level than it will in the remainder of the year. To your broader question, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to grow margins within the smokable products segment. We're really happy with the performance of that segment, the performance of Marlboro, where you saw stable share performance, and growth in the premium segment of the cigarette category.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nOkay. I guess that's helpful, but I guess if I'm hearing you correctly, it's really maybe more of a timing in the one-offs that you mentioned, so as we think about just, honestly, the controllable cost. If those moderate moving forward, especially in the back half, that's going to help to drive the dollar profit growth. Is that part of the confidence you have, especially for the dollar?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nYeah. The year-over-year increase is higher in Q1. And then finally, let me also point out the smokable product segment did benefit from lower SG&A costs, and it'll continue to benefit from that throughout the year. So again, we feel very good about the smokable product segment going forward.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nNo, that helps. And then maybe my next question or final question is on pricing. You guys have taken two increases so far this year, and I'm talking about cig pricing. So that seems to follow your typical quarterly cadence, which sounds reasonable given the unrelenting pressure on cig volumes. But your peers don't seem to be following in terms of frequency or strength.\nI guess I'm asking because how concerned are you about the price gaps and how much they've widened? And I'm asking, especially in light of the downtrading pressures that we're seeing, which seems to be continuing to accelerate. And as you guys called out, the continued proliferation of illicit e-cigs, how should we think about that and your ability to kind of manage these price gaps, etc., and downtrading? Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I appreciate the question, Bonnie. I'll be careful not to talk about future pricing decisions, but I think when you step back and you look at how it's performed over time, I think what you see is the benefit of the investments we made in that analytics.\nReally, from a standpoint of being able to bring revenue growth management where we started in traditional moist smokeless tobacco and brought it over to cigarettes, you see that Marlboro is steady overall share and growing share of premium. Yeah, you see a little bit of downtrading, but I think if you look back through history, you see that occur when the consumer is under economic pressure. We feel good about the tools we have within Marlboro, and I think it shows them the strength of the performance of that brand.\nFrom a standpoint of the pressures on volume, we try to provide for you the decomposition. And you see from a secular decline in price elasticity holding steady, it's really the macroeconomic, and to your point, the proliferation of the illicit e-vapor. And so we really need to see from an overall standpoint a regulatory environment that is effective, and is both looking at authorizing smoke-free products that the consumer is demanding and enforcing against illicit e-vapor products.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, guys. A couple of questions from me, both on the smokables division. I just want to understand if the industry volume decline remains at -9% for the rest of the year, whether that still allows you to hit the bottom end of your EPS outlook. In other words, you still have some room to reduce SG&A costs further and raise pricing higher. And the second question is whether you can share your estimate of the growth of the vapor category in Q1 and what impact this might have had on cigarette volumes in Q1, please.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I appreciate your question. I think from a standpoint of guidance, look, we run a range of scenarios of what could be the outcomes as we progress through the year. We reaffirm that guidance and feel very good about the guidance that we have out in the marketplace. I think when you think about the estimated e-vapor, we believe that the overall e-vapor category continues to grow, with a vast majority of that coming from illicit disposable e-vapor products. While we started filling some of our information gaps, the nature of it being illicit is it goes around the normal distribution chain.\nI think the best thing I can point you to, and we included this in our quarterly metrics, you saw the growth in the consumers engaged on the 12-month movement, just shy of 18 million consumers now engaged, with a step up of both those that are fully converted and those that are still using cigarettes and e-vapor. And then going to the decomposition, our range estimate for the impact of e-vapor on the cigarette category is 1.5 to 2.5.\nAnd again, we're looking to fill those information gaps, but the nature of it being illicit, we feel good about that range. I know it's a bit of a wide range, but as we continue to fill those information gaps and try to get a read on the illicit marketplace, we'll provide those updates as appropriate.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks for that.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nDirector of Food and Tobacco, Stifel\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nGood morning, Matt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nDirector of Food and Tobacco, Stifel\n\nThere was a re-acceleration in price realization in the combustible business in the quarter with the pricing per pack up 8.5%. That's above the 5.5% in Q4. Can you talk about the factors behind the stronger price realization, and are you now lapping some stepped-up investments in the Marlboro brand in response to the pressure on the in response to the economic pressure on the consumer?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I think from a standpoint, I would encourage you to look at price realization over the longer term. I think it's exactly what you referred to. We highlighted as we progressed through 2023, there were some investments we wanted to make, both on the menthol segment of Marlboro as well as some of the discount pressure we're seeing in pockets.\nI think it's important to remember that price gap that we show on a national basis. We're managing that price gap down at the store level. So you can go from one side of a city to the other and see different price gaps in stores. And so being able to mine that data, I think you see it with the strength of Marlboro and, to your point, the strong price realization we experienced in the quarter.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nDirector of Food and Tobacco, Stifel\n\nThank you. My second question: R&D spending is shifting to the all-other segment. The impact from that shift did not seem meaningful in Q1 given the unique higher costs in smokable. Can you talk about the phasing of that R&D shift through 2024? Should we think of the smokable profitability growth weighted to the second half in addition to the overall company EPS growth weighted to the second half?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nMatt, as you know, we don't dive at the segment level, but you are correct in that you are seeing a shift in R&D spending towards the innovative products. That's part of the SG&A benefit I talked about within the smokable segment earlier with Bonnie Herzog. The smokable segment will continue to benefit from those lower SG&A costs as the year progresses.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nDirector of Food and Tobacco, Stifel\n\nThank you, Sal. I'll pass it off.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU Packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nGood morning.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU Packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays\n\nTwo questions from me. So one is on on retail pricing. I think you are saying in Q1 it is 347, and in Q4 it was 377. So have you stepped up promotions on on to stem the share loss that you have seen in oral nicotine pouches?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nI wouldn't say it's stepped up for any purposes from a share standpoint. Really, what you see happening, Gaurav, is you see that the data that we have—I mentioned the investments in advanced analytics—being able to bring that from both moist smokeless tobacco and the smokable segment over to the nicotine pouch segment. And so you're going to have pulse promotions through time. The real goal there is to keep the converted consumer engaged with the brand, but still induce trial both from competitive and those that are making different choices in the nicotine space.\nAnd so you're going to see variability on a short-term basis, but over the long term, I think it's important to step back and see the volume growth that we experience with significant retail price year-over-year.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU Packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays\n\nSure. And my second question is on ABI stakes. So you're highlighting that the remaining stake has a $1.2 billion tax basis. So you have sold one tranche. Your dual losses expire in March 2028. So would we be fair in expecting a progressive exit from the rest of the stake over the next four years?\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nI want to make sure I'm answering your question, Gaurav. If I don't, please follow up. You are right that we provided you with the new tax basis, and tax is just one of many variables that we consider related to the ABI investment and our capital allocation analysis. The transaction that we executed earlier this year, the shares we sold were a mix of both the restricted and unrestricted shares. And what we shared with you is that the tax liability was less than $100 million. Our expectation is that we can offset that in the future related to ABI losses. I'm sorry, dual losses.\nThe other thing I'll just remind you is that if you think about the dual losses, we took about half, let's call it just over half, as ordinary losses for cash tax purposes, but we fully reserved that on the P&L. We continue to wait to get feedback from the IRS. We hope to hear more as the year progresses.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU Packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you so much.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nEVP and CFO, Altria\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Good morning, guys. A couple of slightly different questions from me. On NJOY, you call it the 60 basis points of share gain, which we can see in the scanner data and sounds impressive and a nice improvement. But the scanner data do also show us that the retail sales for the brand are down double digits for the past few months.So I guess my question is, this deterioration, is that just ongoing pressure from illicit products that's impacting the legal products in the market to cause this sort of heavy decline despite the share gain? Or is there something else going on in the category?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I think what you see is exactly what you pointed out, Callum, is that the overall disposable, specifically the illicit vapes in the marketplace, continue to grow, while that segment that's pod or replaceable capsules continue to shrink in the marketplace.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then my second question is on oral tobacco. We touched on this a little bit earlier with, I think, Faham's question, but just building upon it. I think based on the numbers in your release, your share of total oral is now 33%, and volume's declining slightly. I've got ZYN's share based on some numbers from PMI at 28% on an apples-to-apples basis and growing 80% year-on-year. It seems pretty clear that you guys are on the cusp of losing your leadership position now in oral tobacco as a whole.\nI guess my question is, does losing the leadership position change your mindset in how you're going to come about this category? Can you maybe be freed, in a sense, to come at this from a slightly more challenging mindset relative to the sort of maybe slightly defensive mindset that you've necessarily had over the past several years through this pressure from ZYN? Thanks.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I think when you think about the overall oral tobacco category, really the strategy there is to maximize profitability while balancing investments behind Copenhagen, which is the aspirational brand in MST, and make an appropriate investments in on!.\nCopenhagen continues to be the leader in the MST space, and we're pleased with the results we saw in on! in Q1, certainly the growth in volume, the growth in overall share of the oral tobacco space, and the significant increase in retail price. And then behind that, being able to file the application with the FDA for the on! PLUS, which we feel like will perform very well in the marketplace once authorized.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thanks for that.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd as a reminder that is star one if you would like to ask a question. Our next question comes from Jennifer Maloney with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nGood morning.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nGood morning, Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nFirst, I wanted to ask about consumers under pressure. You said on this call that you were going to make appropriate investments and be there for them. Could you tell me what do you mean by that? What kind of investments are you referring to?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah, Jennifer. Really, it's around promotions in the marketplace. When you think about the data analytics that we received, and I highlighted earlier that the price gap in a store can be different than a store across a city or town. It's really mining that data and seeing the consumer economic pressure and being able to dial those resources appropriately for the situation that they're facing. So it's really about retail promotions in the marketplace that we continue to adjust through time. It allows us to be there for the consumer.\nAnother example would be Marlboro Black, having a place for the consumer that wants to engage with Marlboro, having a place that they can continue to gauge even when they're under economic pressure.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nAnd when you say promotional activity, would that apply to both the Marlboro brand and also some of your lower-priced brands?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nWe look across the portfolio. We think of the portfolio as one big RGM pool. And just like I mentioned, Marlboro Black and the Marlboro family, it allows us to take a small segment of Marlboro and be there for the consumer. It gives them a place to continue to engage with the brand, but we look across the entire portfolio.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nLooking out at the rest of 2024, do you expect pressures on lower-income consumers to continue or to moderate?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. I think when you think about the consumer being at the lower end of the socioeconomic status, they've been impacted. While inflation has slowed down a bit, it's still increasing in the cumulative impact of that inflation on their total market purchase, as well as the increase in debt levels. And that, coupled with increased interest rates through time, has impacted discretionary spend for our consumers.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nThanks. One more question on modern oral tobacco. So looking at the share losses in Skoal and Copenhagen, and also the share performance in on!, it seems like ZYN is taking significant share from traditional oral tobacco, and on! isn't catching up to ZYN. So what's your strategy for that overall oral tobacco category, and then specifically for the modern oral subcategory?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nYeah. You may have heard me mention earlier, the overall strategy in oral tobacco is to maximize profitability over the long term while making appropriate investments in Copenhagen and the investments in our on! product in the marketplace. I think when you think about it, it's intuitive that the moist smokeless consumer is the first to move over. They're used to putting nicotine products in their mouth, and moving from MST to nicotine pouch allows them to avoid some of the social friction, spitting things of that nature in relation to enjoying nicotine in their product.\nWhen you think about the ZYN versus on!, we feel very good. I think you saw that, and we highlighted in our remarks. We feel like we're going to have better positioning at retail. We feel good about the existing product, and we feel great about the pipeline to follow, which we'll be following with the FDA, PMTAs on on! PLUS as we progress to the end of this quarter.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nSo would it be fair to say that your goal would be to capture those folks who are moving from Skoal and Copenhagen to modern oral to capture as many of those folks as possible with on! rather than losing them to ZYN?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThat would be correct.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria\n\nThank you.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, Wall Street Journal\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd there appears to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mac Livingston for any closing remarks.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Altria\n\nThanks for joining the call today. Hope you all have a great day. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.\nFinally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was a pivotal year for Altria as we made significant progress in pursuit of our vision by enhancing our smoke-free product portfolio while our businesses performed well in a challenging environment. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 2.3% and continued our long history of rewarding shareholders by delivering nearly $7.8 billion in dividends and share repurchases.\nThroughout 2023, we took several transformative steps that we believe position us for sustained success in the US nicotine space, including completing our acquisition of NJOY and fully integrating it into our family of companies, making exciting progress on our promising smoke-free pipeline, including launching on! PLUS internationally in Sweden, one of the world's largest modern oral tobacco markets, continuing preparations to bring heated tobacco products to market.\nThis includes heated tobacco stick products through Horizon, our joint venture with JT, and our heated tobacco capsule product, SWIC, and advocating for a responsible and well-regulated e-vapor market, including stepped-up enforcement against illicit disposable products. Our vision continues to guide our actions, and we believe that our growing portfolio of smoke-free products positions us well to lead in the evolving nicotine space. My remarks this morning will focus on our view of the US nicotine space and our progress in each of the smoke-free categories.\nI'll then hand it over to Sal, who will provide an update on consumer and industry dynamics and further detail on our business and financial results. Let's begin with the operating environment. We estimate that total industry equivalized nicotine volumes increased approximately 3% for the year and approximately 1% over the past five years on a compounded annual basis, driven by the growth of illicit-flavored disposable e-vapor products. This new estimate marks a change from our previously provided estimates of low single-digit decline in total nicotine over the past several years.\nOur new estimate reflects a deeper ongoing analysis of the impact of illicit products on the e-vapor category. We have previously acknowledged the challenges associated with reading illicit market activity that takes place in less traditional channels, and we believe we have deepened our understanding of market dynamics through improved data sources. Information gaps still remain. As a result, we're making some informed assumptions to better reflect the dynamics at play.\nFor example, we account for differences in liquid volume across products, device attributes, and usage patterns by equivalizing e-vapor volume across different form factors. We then equivalize e-vapor volume back to cigarettes, our base unit of equivalized volume. Because of the volatility that exists in reading the illicit market, our estimates may change over time, and we plan to provide you with our latest and best thinking as it evolves. Of note, our estimate focuses only on usage among age 21 plus consumers.\nLooking now by category, industry cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 8% last year, primarily due to the historical secular rate of decline, the growth of illicit e-vapor products, and continued macroeconomic pressures on smokers. While we're deeply concerned about growth in illicit product use, we are encouraged that adult smokers continue to transition to smoke-free alternatives, which now represent approximately 40% of total nicotine space.\nE-vapor continues to be the largest smoke-free category, and we have observed an increase in the number of adult vapers, driven primarily by those choosing illicit products. Based on our new estimate, the e-vapor category grew approximately 35% in 2023. We believe the category growth was largely driven by illicit-flavored disposable products, which we estimate represents over 50% of the category. We estimate that pod-based products declined approximately 50% and represent between 15% and 20% of the category.\nWe continue to believe the e-vapor category is in the beginning of a reset, and the steps that we have taken since closing the NJOY transaction will allow us to responsibly participate in the category's growth. Let's briefly recap our 2023 actions with NJOY following the completion of our acquisition on 1 June. First, we strengthened NJOY's supply chain to enable our expansion plans. Our teams worked diligently to solidify the entire supply chain, from sourcing direct materials through shipment to retail.\nWe now expect to have capacity to support our expansion plans for NJOY moving forward. Next, we prioritized closing inventory gaps at retail and expanding distribution of ACE. For example, prior to closing, a number of stores had ACE pods in distributions but no devices, while other stores were missing various pod varieties. Our teams have closed inventory gaps in stores that already had distribution, which has significantly improved in stock conditions at retail.\nDuring the Q4, we expanded distribution of ACE to over 75,000 stores, surpassing our previously announced goal of 70,000 stores. These stores represent approximately 75% of e-vapor volume and 55% of cigarette volume sold in the US multi-outlet and convenience channel. We also introduced NJOY's first retail trade program, which we believe will help NJOY achieve optimal visibility and product fixture space at retail. Retailers can sign up for the program at various levels, with merchandising options designed to position NJOY strategically and responsibly to tobacco consumers while creating further awareness of the brand.\nWe're encouraged by our trade partners' response to the program, with approximately 70% of stores having chosen options that secure premium positioning in the e-vapor fixture for NJOY. Fixture resets are well underway, and we expect the majority will be completed in the first half of this year. We believe that achieving manufacturing capacity, supply chain security, and optimal product distribution and placement at retail were necessary precursors to engaging consumers with impactful marketing and promotional offers.\nTurning to NJOY's business results, NJOY's consumables shipment volume was approximately 11 million units for the quarter and 23 million units since closing. NJOY's retail share in the multi-outlet and convenience channel was 3.7% in Q4. In November, we began testing trial-generating bundle offers in a limited number of retail accounts, and the results were very encouraging. Despite the limited reach of these offers, NJOY's retail share increased 0.03 percentage points nationally in November and another 0.03 in December. While still early, we are excited by NJOY's momentum and remain optimistic about its potential in the US market.\nWe expect to further expand NJOY promotions and marketing activations in Q1, and we anticipate submitting a PMTA for NJOY's age-restricted Bluetooth device with non-tobacco flavors in the first half of this year. We look forward to sharing more detail about our plans for the year at CAGNY. Looking more broadly at the e-vapor category, we continue to believe that the current state of the market is intolerable for both legitimate manufacturers and consumers. As I previously stated, the total nicotine space grew in 2023 largely because of illegal flavored disposable e-vapor products.\nThese products are being distributed by companies violating virtually every rule and guidance the FDA has issued since 2016. We are actively engaging with regulators, state and federal lawmakers, our trade partners, and other stakeholders to build awareness of this serious issue and drive marketplace enforcement.\nWhile we believe there is still significant work ahead to eliminate these illicit products from the market, we have seen some encouraging actions. In December, the FDA, in collaboration with US Customs and Border Protection announced the seizure of approximately 1.4 million unauthorized e-vapor products, including ELFBAR and other brands that are popular with underage users.\nWe believe that adopting comprehensive border protection programs is an important step toward clearing the market of illicit products. Additionally, we have worked with legislatures in a number of states that have passed or are considering legislation requiring manufacturers to certify that they have either submitted a PMTA, which is pending, or received a marketing order in compliance with FDA regulations.\nWe also initiated litigation in the United States District Court in California relating to the sale of unlawful products. Although this litigation is facing some initial procedural challenges, we remain committed to explore and pursue all litigation opportunities against manufacturers, distributors, and online retailers related to the sale of unlawful products. A strong course correction is needed to protect the tobacco harm reduction for the millions of adult smokers in the US. We've learned from past experiences that complex issues like this require the work of many stakeholders.\nFor our part, we're working with regulators, legislatures, law enforcement, and others to address the illicit market. And while the FDA and other authorities are stepping up enforcement, more action is needed. Turning to oral tobacco, the nicotine pouch category experienced sizable growth once again, resulting in an estimated 7.5% increase in total US oral tobacco volumes over the past six months.\nIn the Q4, oral nicotine pouches grew 11.8 share points year-over-year and now represent more than 35% of the total US oral tobacco category, on! continued to participate in the category growth, as reported shipment volumes increased nearly 33% in the Q4 and 39% for the full year. In the Q4, Helix continued its focus on volume growth while improving profitability.\nHelix applied its analytics and revenue growth management capabilities to be more flexible and efficient with its promotional investments in the marketplace. As a result, on!'s retail price increased over 47% versus the year-ago period, while growing its retail share by 1.1 percentage points. Encouragingly, we continue to see increasing levels of both trial and adoption of the brand, with repeat purchases up more than 30% year-over-year, despite the substantial increase in retail price. We remain excited about on! PLUS and its potential in the US market. We believe its long-lasting flavor system and proprietary soft and mild material are differentiators in the category.\nWe continue to see encouraging results from the on! PLUS test launch in Sweden. Consumer research from the Q4 indicates that on! PLUS is competitive with the market-leading oral nicotine pouch product in Sweden and is seen as a unique offering with a strong repeat purchase rate of over 30% in the e-commerce channel. Given the success of on! PLUS Mint and Smooth Mint in December, we introduced on! PLUS Berry and Citrus in six and nine milligram strength variants in the e-commerce channel. We also plan to expand on! PLUS to additional retail accounts in Sweden.\nOur teams are on track to submit the PMTA for on! PLUS in the first half of this year, and upon FDA authorization, we expect it will contribute meaningfully to Helix's growth. In heated tobacco, we believe our compelling portfolio of products will appeal to the millions of adult smokers seeking innovative and viable alternatives to e-vapor products.\nWe are continuing regulatory preparations to bring heated tobacco stick products to the US market through Horizon, our joint venture with JT. We remain on track to follow PMTA for Ploom in first half of 2025. We are making continued progress on our heated tobacco capsule product, SWIC. While we believe heated tobacco products can play an important role in achieving harm reduction, the category remains nonexistent in the United States. We're encouraged by the progress we made in 2023, and we're committed to achieving long-term leadership in each of the smoke-free categories while delivering strong shareholder returns.\nLast March, we introduced our 2028 Enterprise Goals. We provided updates on our progress in this morning's press release, and we expect to provide progress updates annually moving forward. We look forward to discussing our exploration of non-nicotine and international nicotine markets at CAGNY later this month. Turning to our 2024 financial outlook, our plans include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with strategic investments toward our vision.\nFor 2024, our planned investment areas include marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products and continued smoke-free product research, development, and regulatory preparations. We believe the external environment will remain dynamic in 2024, and we will continue to monitor the economy, including the cumulative impact of inflation, tobacco consumer dynamics, including purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products, illicit e-vapor products, and regulatory litigation and legislative developments.\nConsidering these factors, we expect to deliver 2024 full-year Adjusted Diluted EPS in a range of $5 to 5.15. This range represents an Adjusted Diluted EPS growth rate of 1% to 4% from a $4.95 base in 2023. We expect 2024 Adjusted Diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our guidance includes the impact of two additional shipping days in 2024 and assumes limited impact from illicit e-vapor enforcement on combustible and e-vapor volumes.\nBefore I turn it over to Sal, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Murray Garnick, who recently announced his decision to retire from Altria. During his remarkable career, Murray represented Altria and its subsidiaries for nearly 40 years, both as outside and in-house counsel, including his last seven as general counsel leading the law and regulatory affairs departments.\nUnder his guidance, we have successfully managed significant litigation challenges and established Altria as a leading advocate for tobacco harm reduction policies in the US. We will continue to benefit from Murray's guidance through Q1, at which time Bob McCarter will assume the role of general counsel. Bob currently leads the management of tobacco health and other litigation. Bob has been with Altria since 2015 and spent 18 years before that representing the company as outside counsel. Please join me in thanking and congratulating Murray on an incredible career.\nWe look forward to introducing Bob to many of you at CAGNY and in the years to come. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nThanks, Billy. Let's begin with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on US tobacco consumers. We believe that discretionary income levels remained under pressure through the Q4. While slightly lower gas prices in the Q4 were a modest tailwind, we believe the cumulative effects of inflation and higher consumer debt levels led to lower discretionary income for tobacco consumers.\nLate last year, we conducted research to understand how tobacco consumers were adjusting their purchasing behaviors to the current macroeconomic environment. Our research indicates smokers continued to feel economic pressure throughout 2023 and were more likely to search for deals when purchasing tobacco products in the Q4. We will continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and changes in marketplace conditions in 2024.\nMoving to our results, our tobacco businesses generated solid financial performance again this year in a challenging external environment. In the smokable product segment, adjusted operating companies' income declined by 1.3% in the Q4 and was essentially flat for the full year. Adjusted OCI results in the Q4 and full year were primarily driven by elevated industry volume declines and higher promotional investments.\nAdjusted OCI margins expanded by 6/10 and 9/10 in the Q4 and full year, respectively. Net pricing remained robust, and net price realization for the segment was 5.5% for the Q4 and 8.8% for the full year. Marlboro displayed resiliency during a period of continued uncertainty for consumers. In the Q4, Marlboro's retail share was 42.2%, unchanged versus the year-ago period, and down just 1/10 sequentially. Marlboro also grew its share within the highly profitable premium segment to 59.2%, an increase of 8/10 versus a year ago and 3/10 sequentially.\nIn 2023, PMUSA used its sophisticated suite of RGM tools to make investments in Marlboro Black to support its share performance. The investments in Marlboro Black gave consumers under economic strain a place to stay within the Marlboro portfolio, while positioning PMUSA to maximize profitability over the long term. Historically, we have seen similar investments improve brand loyalty during times of economic uncertainty, which has contributed to Marlboro's long-standing leadership in the category.\nWe continue to believe that Marlboro remains the aspirational brand in the cigarette category, and we are encouraged by its performance in 2023. Total discount segment share was 28.6% in the Q4, up 4/10 sequentially and 9/10 versus a year ago. We believe that results were driven in part by seasonal trends in the discount segment, and the macroeconomic factors that I just discussed.\nTurning to volumes, smokable product segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 7.6% in the Q4 and 9.9% for the full year. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, domestic cigarette volumes for the Q4, and full year declined by an estimated 9% and 10%, respectively. At the industry level, when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8% in the Q4, and for the full year.\nIn Cigars, reported shipment volume decreased 1.4% for the Q4 and increased 2.8% for the full year, while Black & Mild continued to maintain its leadership in the profitable machine-made tip cigar segment. The oral tobacco product segment reported strong fourth-quarter results. Adjusted OCI and OCI margins increased, and on! continued to grow its retail share of the oral tobacco category year-over-year. For the Q4, adjusted OCI grew 10.3%, and the segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 63.1%, an increase of nearly 2 percentage points versus the prior year.\nThis performance was supported by robust net price realization, due in part to lower promotional investment behind on!. For the full year, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 5.5%, with adjusted OCI margins of 67.4%, up more than 1 percentage point. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 2% and 2.2% for the Q4 and full year, respectively.\nThe segment's volume decline was primarily driven by declines in MST volume, partially offset by the growth of on!. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volumes declined by an estimated 2.5% for the Q4 and full year. Oral tobacco product segment retail share declined by 5.8 percentage points in the Q4, as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by the year-over-year growth of on!.\nTurning to our investment in ABI, we recorded $628 million of adjusted equity earnings for the full year, up 10% versus 2022. We continue to view our stake in ABI as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. In our all-other operating category, we recorded $74 million in adjusted losses for the year, and we continue to return significant cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nLast year, we paid approximately $6.8 billion in dividends and raised our dividend by 4.3% in August, in line with our new progressive dividend growth goal. This marked our 58th increase in the last 54 years and repurchased 22.7 million shares, which completed our previously authorized $1 billion program. Our balance sheet remained strong. As of the end of the Q4, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x, in line with our new capital structure goal of approximately 2x. In the Q4, we issued $1 billion in debt that we plan to use to retire approximately $1.1 billion in maturing debt in the Q1.\nEarlier this week, our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2024. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory, and other items. Let's open the question and answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Once again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone at this time. Investors, analysts, and media representatives are now invited to participate in the question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question will come from Matt Smith, with Stifel.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning, Billy and Sal.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nGood morning, Matt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nI wanted to ask a question if we could start with the EPS guidance for the year. When we consider the 1% to 4% growth, you note that it'll be weighted towards the second half. Can you talk about the factors supporting that higher growth in the second half? How much of that is the difference between incrementally higher investment in the first half before your anniversary, some higher investment levels in 2023, versus your outlook for the cigarette volumes, including the additional shipping days in the second half?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, thanks, Matt, for the question. I think when you think about it being weighted to the second half of the year, I think there's two major components you should think of, the biggest being NJOY. You remember we closed that on 1 June 2023, so we had amortization of that acquisition. So you'll have the investments that we highlighted in our remarks, of course, in the first half of the year where you didn't have that in the first half of last year. I think the other thing to note is, remember, there are two extra shipping days.\nOne of those will occur in the Q3 and one in the Q4. So they're both back half of the year weighted. I think those are the two major things. Of course, there are always pick and take, but those are the two major things I would highlight.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nThank you for that, Billy. And if I could ask a second question here. When we look at the price realization on a per-pack basis in the smokable business, that year-over-year contribution decelerated through 2023, especially in the second half, with realized pricing well below the rate of list price increases. Can you talk about the offsets to the price announcements that you have made? How much of that difference between list and realized prices is due to trade-down mix within Marlboro, with Marlboro Black, Gold, and other extensions versus increased promotional spending?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, it's a little bit of both. I think when you think about it, Matt, we tried to highlight that our consumer is under pressure, and we felt like we could use the Marlboro Black franchise as well as rounding out that portfolio with the Marlboro Gold pack. I think if you look back in history, you see we use these tools. It allows us to take a small segment of Marlboro and provide a place for consumers under pressure because Marlboro is still the aspirational brand in the marketplace.\nThose that are facing economic pressures have a place to continue to interact with Marlboro and purchase Marlboro. You'll see historically when economic pressures ease a bit for our consumers, we're able to lessen those promotional. But in essence, we've kept them in the Marlboro franchise, the brand itself, and it's much more effective and efficient to do it that way than try to win them back if they trade it down.\nI would encourage you to think about price realization over the long term. When you look at it on a quarter basis, you have timing of pricing, things of that nature. But even if I can't encourage you to look at it over the long term, at least look at it and look at comps year-over-year. I think if you look last year, you'll see the Q4 was a high mark compared to the other quarters from a price realization. So comps will affect it to a certain degree as well.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stifel\n\nThank you for that, Billy. I'll pass it on.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThanks.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll turn now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst of Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Congrats to Murray and thanks to him for all of the help over the years.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, thanks for that, Pamela.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst of Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nSo, question on the guidance for low single-digit earnings growth in 2024. This follows a year of low single-digit growth in 2023, but your growth algorithm calls for mid-single-digit earnings growth. So do you think that your longer-term targets are still achievable, and what do you anticipate changing over the next few years that can put you on that path?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, thanks for your question, Pamela. I think there are a number of factors you should think about. When we put that enterprise goal out there, we talked about it on a compounded annual basis. We highlighted for you that there would be variability throughout that process because there are going to be years where you have investment. You heard the answer to the previous question. We closed NJOY in the second half of the year, and so now you have a full year of investment.\nOn the other hand, you have give and take across it because you saw the increase in profitability with on!.So as you're investing, the various categories are going to be at different levels of investment and as we're able to ease those investments, that's what we anticipate through time. The aspiration is to be a leader in each of the categories, and you know that we are pretty successful in increasing margins through time.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst of Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. And then in the smokable segment, this was the second consecutive quarter of negative sales and OCI growth. Given several years of elevated cigarette volume declines and a heightened competitive backdrop, how do you get comfort that your financial model is sustainable? And more near-term, do you anticipate that smokable segment operating profit can grow in 2024?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I would point you back to the decomposition of overall industry volume and the factors affecting it. The ones I would highlight is really the macroeconomic and other. And remember, there are two components there.\nOne, we've been highlighting for you that the consumer is under economic pressure, and when they're under economic pressure, they make different decisions in the moment. The other is the explosion of illicit vape. It's having an impact both in the combustible segment as well as the e-vapor segment, the legitimate e-vapor segment, if you will. And so it's having an impact on both. So I think as you think about the economy through time, as well as what is necessary, which is significantly more enforcement of illegitimate and illegal products in the marketplace, those consumers will be at play.\nWe want to keep them in the e-vapor market, and that's why you see the distribution and the movements we've made with NJOY, but keeping them in the e-vapor market responsibly. And so that's the way we think about it through time.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst of Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And just one last one. Can you talk about the current competitive backdrop and what you're observing from the premium and deep discount cigarette segments, as well as from e-vapor and your strategy to compete against each of these segments?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think when you think about the combustible segment, it has always been a competitive marketplace. I think we're seeing these other bigger challenges with the consumer being under pressure and the illicit vape. From an illicit vape standpoint, the consumers are moving. What's encouraging is it's a proof of harm reduction. If we had harm-reduced products in the marketplace, consumers would move, but they have to be reviewed and authorized by the FDA for the consumer to be able to count on that.\nSo I think when you think about through time the competitive, I would point to Marlboro continues to grow its share in the premium segment, and its overall share has been really steady if you go pre-pandemic to post-pandemic, but it continues to be a competitive marketplace. I think when you think about e-vapor, we've certainly seen competitors step up their promotional spend as we have expanded distribution of NJOY. We've shared with you, if you will, the consumer research that we did prior to the acquisition.\nWe feel good about the proposition we have with NJOY and the early consumer feedback we have on the product in the marketplace. So we look forward to being able to continue to engage with the consumer as we move through 2024.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst of Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I'll pass it on.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll hear next from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. All right. Thank you.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, everyone. And Murray, definitely all the best in your retirement.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nI'm sure he'll appreciate that, Bonnie. Thanks. Yep.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI had a quick follow-up question on your smokable segment. I guess, Billy and Sal, I mean, could you guys give us a sense of what's factored into your EPS growth guidance this year? I guess I'm thinking about it on the low end of your guidance range. Does the low end assume essentially no dollar profit growth for smokable? Just trying to understand maybe how much flexibility you have to kind of hit some of these ranges.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I appreciate your question, Bonnie. You'll recall we don't really offer guidance down to the level because we're balancing that. That's why we put forward the enterprise goals. Remember, one is the overall margin for the portfolio of products because, as I mentioned earlier, each of those categories are going to be in different points of investment. What we strive for in the combustible segment is to maximize profitability over the long term.\nWe're going to make appropriate investments in Marlboro and investments in the growth categories. So we tried to lay for you, if you will, the groundwork of how we're going to manage the business through time.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Then I did want to ask about your smoke-free vision. Just hoping for maybe a little more details on the vision and where you expect to be by the end of the year in terms of progress. You touched on NJOY and then maybe a little bit more color and update on your JV with JTI, etc. And then I'm also trying to understand how to think about required investments this year versus last year.\nCan you give us a sense if spending behind your vision will accelerate in 2024? And if so, are your core smokable and, I guess, oral tobacco businesses strong enough to support this stepped-up spending and your ability ultimately to generate EPS growth? I think that's one of the key questions here. Thank you.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, there was a lot in that question, Bonnie, so I'll try to unpack it, but follow up if I missed a piece. So I'll start in the reverse order. Yeah, we feel like our core businesses are very strong. When you look at the strength of Marlboro in the marketplace, you look at the aspiration of Copenhagen and MST, and you look at the performance of those businesses through time, you see that they're very strong and continue to be strong.\nAs far as investments, I'll speak to your ask about Ploom. We shared in our remarks we're continuing to work on the application there. We expect to file that in first half of 2025. It's just the application process, component, and the studies that are involved with that. But we feel good about what we've seen with interactions with the consumer to this point.\nAs far as NJOY, certainly you can expect more investment in 2024 than you did in 2023. Some of that's just the nature of we didn't close it until 1 June. But now we're in 75,000 stores, and so we're really looking forward to having that in the stores where consumers are shopping, having it displayed much more prominently than it ever has been. We secured, as I mentioned, the great spot on the fixture, but having that in the consideration set. And we feel like once we get that in consumers' hands, consumer research would tell us that they will convert through time to the product because they enjoy it.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder for our investors, analysts, and media representatives, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. We'll go now to Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks very much for the question. Another one on price mix, but maybe from a slightly longer-term perspective. We've obviously seen a divergence, I think I would describe it this year, between your pricing strategy and some of your big peers. And it seems like the peers are signaling that they're set to continue on their path. So I guess this is for Billy. My question is, do you see a strategic imperative to react to some of that more competitive pricing? And maybe is that what we're seeing in the big step down in sequential price mix this quarter? Or are you content over the longer term to continue this divergence?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I appreciate your question. I think if you recall, as we progressed through 2023, we highlighted for you pockets of the US where we felt like we needed to make some investments. Some in the menthol segment, we saw some competitors get a bit aggressive in the menthol space, and we made those investments. And some was related directly to the discount category and some of the aggressiveness there.\nI think overall, when you look at Marlboro and its steadiness in share and its growth in the premium segment, you can see with the RGM capabilities and the data analytics that we have, we're able to be very efficient and effective with spending in the marketplace, trying to get, if you will, to the individual consumer so that we can deal with the individual consumer that is facing those either competitive decisions with the aggressiveness that they take or with just their economic situation. And I think you see that we've actually been able to implement that very well, again, with the steadiness of Marlboro and the investments that we've made.\n\nSal Mancuso\n\nCFO, Altria Group\n\nHi, Callum. This is Sal. You know, I touched on this in our opening remarks, that the utilization of the breadth of Marlboro's brand family and utilizing SKUs to interact with consumers who are under economic pressure has occurred in the past. It's happened with Special Blend, as an example, during difficult economic times. So you called it a divergence, but I would say this is something that we've done in the past, and we've been able, as the economy improves, to margin up those SKUs, but also see consumers return to mainline Marlboro.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI guess I'm just slightly surprised because I think your table in the quarterly metrics disclosures suggests that the macroeconomic pressure has actually lessened this quarter, whereas obviously the price mix suggests that that trade down has accelerated in a very meaningful way.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think you have to think about it as headwinds, tailwinds. Certainly, gas prices have declined, so you can think of gas prices being a bit of a tailwind. You also have to think about the debt load and the cumulative impact of inflation on the total basket that our consumer purchases. It's that cumulative impact that's affected discretionary income. And then I mentioned debt load just because from a debt load standpoint, the increase in interest rate also affects their discretionary income. So I think overall, if you think about their discretionary income, it's down.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you. And I have a sort of very, very different follow-up. The question is, can you talk about some of the recent regulatory changes in Louisiana where I think they've been taking it upon themselves to clamp down on the illegal sales that you spoke about, Billy, of the disposable vaping products, given the inaction that we've seen from the FDA? I think some of those changes took place in November, so we should have a couple of months' worth of data now. What impact have you seen in Louisiana, and do you expect that other states might follow that path that Louisiana has taken?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, that is a law based on efforts by ourselves and working with the legislatures in the state. And what you're referring to is Louisiana requires manufacturers to certify the individuals within the company to certify that they either have followed FDA guidance and they have a legitimate application on file and it's pending, or that they have actually received authorization. It is early right now, Callum, in Louisiana.\nI would say the early signs are encouraging that we are seeing illicit vape being removed from the marketplace. I hope that that trend continues. And there have been a number of states that have passed similar legislation, as well as a number of states that are considering it. But it's a bit early, but yeah, the early signs are encouraging.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Pallav Mittal with Barclays.\n\nPallav Mittal\n\nVP of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you. Can you please comment on the sell-through trend for NJOY? Or is the 11 million number, the shipment, similar to retail trend as well?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, what we tried to share with you is that was the shipment volume. We tried to share with you also the share, and if you will, that's an estimate of consumer take. So it was 3.7 for the period that we owned them. And then we tried to highlight for you that we had put in place testing some bundle offers where we could test trial promotions so that we were prepared for the full distribution and be able to bring that across the US this year.\nWe did it on a small scale, but just that small scale impacted national share, an additional incremental 3/10 in November and another incremental 3/10 in December. So it's early. We'll be bringing that marketing activation and promotional to the nation this year, but certainly the early results are very encouraging.\n\nPallav Mittal\n\nVP of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nSure. And one more. So of the -8% decline in industry volumes, how much do you think is the cannibalization from e-cigarettes, and how much is the impact from the growth in modern oral?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I would say from modern oral, it's minimal impact. You'll recall that in secular decline, we represent historically about 1% across category movement. Then we try to call out any additional or special items. What we call out, and you'll see that in our quarterly metrics, is that about 1.5% to 2.5% is related to the illicit e-vapor category. So if you think about historically 1% being up in secular decline, this 1.5% to 2.5% being related to illicit vape. But yeah, we're encouraged that we're seeing some interaction with adult smokers, but at this point, from an impact to the overall industry, it is minimal. It is really illicit vape that is driving the majority of that.\n\nPallav Mittal\n\nVP of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go now to Jennifer Maloney with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nGood morning.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nGood morning, Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nI have a question about the California market dynamic data that you shared this morning. It looks like overall cigarette industry sales fell in California more steeply than the country overall in 2023. But it also looks like Marlboro and Philip Morris USA retail share increased in California more than elsewhere. So is it fair to say that as a result of the menthol ban, some consumers moved away from cigarettes, either stopped smoking or moved to other products? But also there was a dynamic here where people who might have smoked menthol cigarettes switched to Marlboro cigarettes?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, it's a complex issue, so let me try to unpack it for you. When you look at that 15%, we would consider that legitimate shipments that went to California. What you're seeing is a lot of black market activity that takes place in California. So you see gray market consumers going across the border, and we've seen that, whether it be Nevada or other bordering states, some consumers go across to get their menthol cigarettes.\nWe're seeing a lot of black market interruption from Mexico into the state of California. That would not be included in the 15%. So that is black market or illegal product that has made its way into California for the consumer to buy. Again, that wouldn't be in the 15%. We do believe some consumers have moved. Certainly, there's a huge market of illicit vape in California that continues even though the flavor ban is in place.\nTo answer your question on the adult cigarette consumer, what you see with the benefit of Marlboro is, I think if you look at various studies, when there's a menthol ban, the consumer really doesn't leave the nicotine space. And a lot of them don't even leave cigarettes. They look to non-menthol cigarettes as an alternative. And with their over-indexing in non-menthol, it makes sense that they would move to Marlboro.\nOne of the other things I would highlight in moving to non-menthol is we've seen an influx of what we call menthol cards into the state of California. So again, they're illegal, but it allows the consumer to buy a non-menthol pack of cigarettes, insert the card, and then, if you will, self-mentholate their cigarettes. So there, I think it points again to when you pass a law without an eye towards how you're going to enforce the law. You see a significant amount of illicit activity that takes place related to that.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhat I don't see here is PM USA total shipments in California. I see that there's a retail share increase, but did your sales in California decrease in 2023 more than the national average?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThey did. They're commensurate with overall industry.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nOkay. So based on your observations of the market dynamics in California, what would you expect to see if a national menthol cigarette ban were implemented in terms of market dynamics and the impact on your sales?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nIt's hard to answer on the hypothetical, Jennifer, and I apologize for it. Without seeing the actual proposed rule and what's going to take place, it's tough to say what their enforcement activities will be. I think if you look at our comments related to the menthol ban, you'll see that we felt like the FDA needed to take into consideration all of the unintended consequences, and that you're seeing them take place in California.\nBlack market activity, illicit product getting into the marketplace, mentholated cards. So there are a lot of unintended consequences. So it'd be tough to tell, if you will, how the consumer will be at play in that depending on what's available to them.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nBut in California, your sales went down, although you did see some share gain as menthol smokers switched over to Marlboro.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThat is correct.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nIf the draft rule were adopted as a final rule, do you intend to file a legal challenge if that final rule is published?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nI think it's too early to tell. We would certainly anticipate that there would be legal challenges, but it's too early to tell whether we would be involved. We would like to be able to understand the rule as it's published finally and then make that decision, and we'll share it with you when we have anything to share.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nOne last question on modern oral nicotine products. Are they a risk to young people? And what flavors and marketing approaches do you think are appropriate for that category?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I think they could be a risk for underage if not marketed and sold responsibly. So we actually sent a letter to the FDA many months ago that they should encourage them to issue marketing guidelines for the category so that, regardless of authorizations or not, be able to have marketing guidelines for that category so that all industry members could follow so that we can protect the harm reduction for adults without exposing underage users to the category.\nWe haven't seen any action by the FDA, but certainly we, as our approach to the marketplace, have very minimal underage interaction with our brand.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nWell, what would those marketing guidelines look like, ideally, in your view? Would it entail flavor restrictions? Would it entail restrictions on social media marketing and influencers?\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nWell, I won't get into the details because we shared that with the FDA, and we haven't seen any action at this point. But certainly, what would be considered a responsible approach to the marketplace.\n\nJennifer Maloney\n\nDeputy Corporate Bureau Chief and Retail Editor, The Wall Street Journal\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, it is star one if you would like to ask a question. We'll go next to Emma Rumney with Thomson Reuters.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Thomson Reuters\n\nHi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first one is around the successful challenges to the FDA's marketing denial orders for some vapes, which have started to put some pressure on the agency and also increase the likelihood of a case going to the Supreme Court. I wondered whether Altria would want to participate in any Supreme Court case, and if so, how it's preparing for that possibility.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, I think you certainly highlight that the circuit courts have taken different positions on the approach by the FDA in the e-vapor market. We certainly are closely monitoring these cases, but I think when you step back from it, we're in a unique position. We're the only pod-based product that has received authorization from the FDA. So if you think about other major competitors in the pod segment, they have not received authorization.\nOur authorization was in the tobacco-flavored pods, and our application for the menthol version of the same product is pending with the FDA. We really feel like, looking at those court cases in both instances where the circuit courts have taken different positions, we believe that we should get a marketing order for this menthol product, whether you look at the holdings on either of those instances of the circuit court. We'll monitor those, but we're in a unique position.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Thomson Reuters\n\nOkay. Thank you. Just to follow up to an earlier question around the sustainability of the financial model for the smokable segment in particular. Obviously, the industry has for some time now effectively used pricing increases to offset volume declines. The last couple of quarters, it seems that that's been a bit more difficult given the downtrading and the promotional environment that you flagged.\nSo I'm wondering whether the ability to offset declines with pricing in the smokable segment is kind of disappearing, or you feel that that will return when the economic environment improves and promotions sort of ease a little bit.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nYeah, I'll be careful not to talk about future pricing, but I'll describe how we think about pricing. It's certainly an important part of the algorithm. I think you've seen us take pricing. I know people are focused on Q4 price realization. I tried to express that if you're going to look at it on a short-term basis, at least look at comps versus prior year. We look at price realization over the long term. When we think about the strategy in combustibles, it really is to maximize profitability over the long term while balancing appropriate investments in Marlboro with the areas that are growing.\nWhen you look at that and look through history and see the price realization, you see the data analytics and the revenue growth management capabilities kicking in. Marlboro has been steady, has grown its share of premium, and we continue to compete what we feel like very effectively and efficiently, fulfilling what our strategy is for the category through time. Okay. So you're kind of confident that the smokable segment can return to revenue growth in the future? I think when you look at it, it will continue to execute against our strategy, which is to maximize profitability over the long term.\n\nEmma Rumney\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Correspondent, Thomson Reuters\n\nAll right. Thanks very much.\n\nBilly Gifford\n\nCEO, Altria Group\n\nThank you.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThere appears to be no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mac Livingston for any closing remarks.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer, Altria Group\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Ashley. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's third quarter and first 9-month business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com.\nDuring our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2022. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our Board. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.\nFinally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our highly profitable traditional tobacco businesses were resilient in a dynamic operating environment during the third quarter and first 9 months, providing fuel for a business transformation and significant cash returns to our shareholders. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 3.3% for the first 9 months and returned more than $5.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to balance maximizing profitability from our smokeable and moist smokeless tobacco businesses with investments to realize our vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.\nThis morning, I will focus on our progress with NJOY, the state of the e-vapor category and the encouraging third quarter results from on!. I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide an update on consumer and industry dynamics, further detail on our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year.\nLet's begin in the e-vapor category. In our first full quarter of ownership, our teams executed NJOY's business plans with speed and focus to lay the foundation for Enjoy's long-term success. To date, NJOY ACE remains the only pod-based e-vapor product with a marketing authorization from the FDA. We're actively working to bring this compelling smoke-free alternative for more smokers and e-vapors across the United States. We believe that the long-term success in e-vapor will be influenced by our actions in the near term, and we're executing in the marketplace to grow the business responsibly and sustainably.\nFirst, while already strong, strengthening NJOY's supply chain was a necessary step to begin the initial phase of our expansion with ACE. Our teams worked diligently to solidify the entire supply chain from sourcing directerials through the shipment to retail. As a result, we do not anticipate capacity constraints as we execute our initial expansion plan.\nNext, during the third quarter, our teams prioritized closing inventory gaps at retail and expanding distribution of ACE. Prior to the acquisition, NJOY had a small-scale sales force, resulted in inventory volatility and significant distribution gaps at retail. Upon completion of the NJOY transaction, we immediately unleashed our sales force to focus on closing the inventory gaps in stores that already had distribution. We improved inventory conditions in stores and are actively working to close remaining gaps at retail.\nFor expansion, ACE distribution grew to approximately 42,000 stores during the third quarter and is now distributed in all of the top 25 convenience store chains by e-vapor volume. In addition, we began to amplify visibility with new point-of-sale and fixture signage at retail. During the fourth quarter, we continue to expect ACE expansion to reach a total of 70,000 stores by year-end. Representing approximately 70% of e-vapor volume and 55% of cigarette volume sold in the U.S. multi-outlet and convenience scanner. As we continue to expand distribution and close inventory gaps, we expect to further enhance visibility and product fixture space at retail.\nLast month, NJOY unveiled its first retail trade program. Retail partners can sign up for the program at various levels with merchandising options designed to position NJOY strategically and responsibly to tobacco consumers while creating further awareness of the brand. And as we move to our next phase of e-vapor consumer engagement, we are beginning to test a variety of promotional plans and anticipate more disruptive execution at retail in the fourth quarter.\nMoving into 2024. We will continue to refine our promotional plans, implement NJOY's retail trade program, further expand distribution and evolve our consumer engagement strategy. Our strategies will focus on informing adult vapors and smokers of the attributes of ACE, such as battery capacity and pods relative to other leading brands, generating trial and growing brand loyalty. In addition, plans for a new brand equity campaign are well underway. We expect the equity campaign to further amplify the brand's presence at retail and drive consumer engagement with the brand. We're excited to share more on this campaign and the next phases of our growth plans in the near future.\nLooking more broadly at the e-vapor category, the current state of the market is intolerable for both legitimate manufacturers and consumers. As we have noted repeatedly 4 months, the regulated market is being overrun by illegal flavored disposable e-vapor products made and distributed by companies violating virtually every rule and guidance FDA has issued since 2016. Regulation not in force is indistinguishable from no regulation at all. Illegal e-vapor products circumvent the actions of regulators, responsible manufacturers and retailers by evading scientific review, quality manufacturing controls, marketing oversight and legal aids or purchase restrictions.\nDespite recent actions by the FDA, enforcement has been inadequate and ineffective. We believe the FDA has good tools necessary to bring order to the market. For our part, we are actively engaged with regulators state and federal lawmakers and trade partners and other stakeholders to build awareness of these serious issues and drive marketplace enforcement. We have also taken more targeted but necessary action and initiated litigation in the United States District Court in California against 34 organizations, including manufacturers, distributors and online retailers related to the sale of unlawful products. A strong course correction is needed to protect the tobacco farm reduction opportunity for the 30 million adult smokers in the U.S.\nTurning to oral tobacco. The nicotine pole category experienced sizable growth once again, resulting in an estimated 5% increase in total U.S. oral tobacco volumes over the past 6 months. Full nicotine cultures grew nearly 10 share points year-over-year and now represent more than 32% and the U.S. oral tobacco category. on! participated in the category growth as third quarter reported shipment volumes increased nearly 37% versus the year ago period.\nDuring the quarter, Helix focused on continued volume growth while improving profitability. Helix applied its evolving analytical resources to be more flexible with its promotions in the marketplace. As a result, Barn's retail price increased 33% per can sequentially and 52% versus the prior year, closing the gap [indiscernible] in by over $1 year-over-year. Encouragingly, we continue to see increasing level of both trial and adoption of the brand with repeat purchases up more than 35% year-over-year despite the substantial increase in retail price.\nIn addition, on's! retail share of the oral tobacco category was 6.9%, up 1.7 share points versus the prior year and stable sequentially. Internationally, on! PLUS began its test launch in Sweden, one of the largest modern oral tobacco markets in the world. And consumers are engaging with the brand through both e-commerce and select retail locations. While still early days, we are encouraged by the feedback we've received from consumers. Initial consumer data showed that on! PLUS performed well in the areas of comfort, flavor and overall satisfaction. We believe that on! PLUS' long-lasting flavor system and proprietary software material are differentiators in the category.\nWe are at an exciting period in our history. We have an unprecedented opportunity to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to our smoke-free future. Our smoke-free portfolio is compelling, and I am encouraged by our initial progress with Enjoy and on's! strong performance. I believe we have the appropriate strategy, on! people in place to execute our growth plans. I continue to believe that we can achieve our vision and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Billy. Let's begin with an update on consumer and industry dynamics. During the third quarter, cigarette industry volume declines continued to be elevated from their historical levels, due in part to macroeconomic factors, and the growth of illegal favored disposable e-vapor products. By design, illicit products are largely distributed through nontraditional untracked channels requiring us to refine our ability to estimate their impacts on the industry. With the information we have today, we believe that there is more cross-category movement than previously assumed. And we now estimate that growth of illegal flavor disposable e-vapor products contributed to industry, cigarette industry declines in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% and over the last 12 months.\nThe updated estimates have been reflected in our decomposition of cigarette industry decline rates. We will continue to monitor this dynamic trend and are actively pursuing better data sources to enhance our estimates in this space.\nTurning to results for the quarter. The Smokeable Products Segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles over the long term, while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. In fact, during the third quarter, the smokable products segment expanded adjusted OCI margins while Marlboro grew its retail share sequentially in the cigarette category and within the premium segment.\nAdjusted operating companies income declined by 2.5% in the third quarter but grew by 0.2% for the first 9 months. The adjusted OCI declined during the third quarter was primarily driven by elevated industry volume declines due to the factors I mentioned and higher promotional investments. As a reminder, there was also 1 fewer shipping day in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by [ 70 ] and [ 0.9 ] in the third quarter and the first 9 months, respectively. Net pricing remained robust, and net price realization for the segment was 8.6% in the third quarter and 9.8% for the first 9 months.\nMarlboro was resilient during the quarter and its retail share of the cigarette category grew [ 310 ] sequentially to 42.3%, while declining [ 310 ] versus the year ago period. Promotional investments across the Marlboro portfolio, such as investments in Marlboro Black supported the strong share performance for the quarter. Additionally, Marlboro grew its share within the stable premium segment to 58.9%, an increase of [ 310 ] sequentially and [ 410 ] year-over-year. while other brands ceded share in the premium segment sequentially and year-over-year.\nTotal discount segment share grew 1.1 percentage points year-over-year to 28.2% but has been flat since the first quarter of 2023. We believe the recent stability in discount is an encouraging sign, considering the adverse macroeconomic conditions compacting smokers, in the premium position of our portfolio. Smokeable Products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 11.6% in the third quarter and 10.5% for the first 9 months. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, third quarter domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10%. For the first 9 months, adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10.5%. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8% in the third quarter and for the first 9 months.\nIn Cigars, John Middleton reported exceptional performance through the first 9 months and cigar shipment volume increased 4.2%. The Oral Tobacco Products Segment reported strong results during the quarter. As adjusted OCI and OCI margins increased while on! continued to grow its retail share of the oral tobacco category year-over-year. For the third quarter, adjusted OCI grew 7.1% and the segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 69.3%, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points versus the prior year. This performance was supported by robust net price realization due in part to the more efficient on! promotional investments, Billy described earlier.\nFor the first 9 months, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 4.1%, with adjusted OCI margins of 68.9%, up nearly 1 percentage point. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 3.3% and 2.3% for the third quarter and for the first 9 months, respectively. The segment's volume decline was driven by declines in MSP volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, segment volumes declined by an estimated 2% and 2.5% for the third quarter and first 9 months, respectively. Oral Tobacco Products Segment retail share declined 4.2 percentage points in the third quarter as declines in our MSP brands were partially offset by the year-over-year growth of on!.\nTurning to capital allocation. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders. In the third quarter we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raised our dividend by 4.3% in August, in line with our new progressive dividend goal. This increase marked our 58th increase in the last 54 years. And repurchased 5.9 million shares for $260 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had $268 million remaining under our current share repurchase program which we expect to complete by the end of the year. In addition, our balance sheet remained strong through the quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x.\nLet's turn to our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We are narrowing our full year 2023 guidance range and now expect to deliver diluted -- adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.91 to $4.98. This range represents a growth rate of 1.5% to 3% from a base of $4.84 in 2022. Finally, at our Investor Day, we announced the creation of our Connect and Transform open innovation system, which is focused on partnering externally to leverage subject matter expertise, new technologies and disruptive innovations to augment our internal capabilities and support our innovation strategies. As part of this system, today, we are publishing 11 innovation briefs. More information is available on altria.com.\nWith that, we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com.

While our brands continue to former levels in the day, we remain concerned policies. We continue of the is we cited in our first quarter remarks such as the products retail and then on and activity -- for example, 65,000 CDE, branded per were sold a couple in the first half of the year more in triple the MMS in the days combined. In comparison [Indiscernable]\nWhen the all cigarettes were still legally available. To further understand consumer use of illicit nicotine products, we commissioned a third-party study in California, where researchers collected and analyzed nearly 20,000 distorted tobacco products. Their findings suggest that almost half of the cigarettes consumed were not tax stamp for sale in California. And approximately 20% of the cigarette packs were menthol or products we believe other manufacturers recently introduced to sidestep the purpose of the law.\nIn comparison, Menthol represented approximately 1/4 of the total California cigarette category prior to the bands enactment. And finally, while disposable e-vapor products were overrepresented in the study, 98% of the collected e-vapor products were flavored despite being subject to the California flavor ban and unauthorized by the FDA. These figures are alarming. And indicate substantial illicit market activity. We believe the best way to prevent [ illicted ] markets is to keep tobacco products legal and regulated.\nWe have made this clear in the public comments we submitted in response to the FDA's proposed menthol ban. Our goal is for policymakers to embrace [ Harmon ] as the proper framework for tobacco and nicotine product regulation. And there's a growing course of diverse stakeholders who agree, including consumers, our trade partners, public health advocates criminal justice reform advocates, law enforcement and tobacco growers.\nIn fact, public opinion overwhelmingly supports for [ reduction ] over prohibition. And [ Sian ] shows a significant public health benefit us moving smokers away from combustible products for what a smoke-free future. We will continue to advocate for a well-regulated U.S. tobacco industry that embraces harmonuction. We have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our results and the business environment.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Billy. The smokeable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles over the long term, while appropriately balancing investments in [ lab ] with funding the growth of smoke-free products. The segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by 3.1% in the second quarter and by 1.7% in the first half. Adjusted OCI margins expanded to more than 60% for the second quarter and first half.\nThis performance was supported by robust net price realization of 10.1% in the second quarter and 10.5% for the first half. At retail, Marlboro net pack price increased 6.1% in the second quarter compared to last year. Smokeable Products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.7% in the second quarter and 10% in the first half.\nWhen adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, second quarter and first half, domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10% and 10.5%, respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 7.5% in the second quarter and by 8% in the first half.\nAt retail, the total discount segment share grew 1.8 percentage points year-over-year to 28.2%, but was flat sequentially. We believe some smokers are trading down as a result of the adverse financial conditions that Billy described. We also continued to see increased competitive activity in the discount segment. Including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.\nAs Billy mentioned, Marlboro displayed resiliency during a period of economic pressure for consumers. In the second quarter, Marlboro's retail share of the cigarette category grew 10% sequentially to 42.1%, while declining 0.6p versus the year ago period partially driven by the discount dynamics that I described.\nWe have also seen a decline in Marlboro's menthol share of the total category as a result of the California flavor ban and increased competitive activity from premium menthol brands in the balance of the country. Additionally, Marlboro grew its share within the premium segment to 58.6% and [Indiscernable] over the past year.\nWe believe Marlboro's performance over the long term is a testament to it as the aspirational brand with strong consumer loyalty. In cigars, reported cigar shipment volume increased 5% in the first half. To continue this momentum, the Middleton team is expanding Royal, which will further enhance Black & Mild's plastic tip offerings.\nThe team expects Black & Mild Royal to be available nationally later this month. Moving to the oral tobacco products segment. Second quarter adjusted OCI grew 3% and in the segment expanded adjusted OCI margins to 68%. This performance was supported by robust net price realization due in part to more efficient on promotional investments.\nIn the first half, the segment grew adjusted OCI by 2.6% with strong adjusted OCI margins of 68.7%. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased by 1.7% and 1.8% for the second quarter and the first half, respectively. The segment's volume decline was driven by declines in MSP volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volume declined by an estimated 2.5% for both the second quarter and first half.\nOral Tobacco Products segment retail share declined 2.8 percentage points in the second quarter as declines in our MSC brands were partially offset by the continued growth of on!. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! continued to grow share in a competitive category and Copenhagen remain the category leader.\nMoving to our investment in ABI. We recorded $132 million of adjusted equity earnings in the second quarter. This was an increase of approximately 6.5% from the year ago period and represents Altria's share of ABI's first quarter 2023 results. Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x.\nIn July, we received the remaining $1.7 billion plus interest from Philip Morris International as a part of the IQOS agreement we announced last fall. After receiving the payment, we repaid the term loan we entered to finance the NJOY transaction. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our focus on significant capital returns and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nWe demonstrated this commitment in the first half by completing our acquisition of NJOY. Retiring approximately $1.6 billion in long-term notes at maturity with available cash, paying approximately $3.4 billion in dividends and repurchasing 10.4 million shares totaling $472 million.\nAt the end of June, we had $528 million remaining under the currently authorized $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year.\nWith that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nJust quickly, before we turn it over to the Q&A, I just want to apologize to those of you on the webcast for some audio issues we had early on in the call. So we will work to expedite the posting of our replay so you'll have full access to the remarks. So with that, we'll turn to Q&A. .",

Earnings Call\n\nMONYSEAPR 27, 9:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and welcome to the Altria Group 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks with Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations with Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Katie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO will discuss Altria's first quarter business results.\nEarlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2022.\nOur remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of our Board.\nWe report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results.\nDescriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are off to a strong start and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against full year plans.\nOur tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we announced exciting progress toward our vision. Highlights from our first quarter included strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5.4%, resilient in-market performance from our leading brands, including Marlboro and Copenhagen and continued volume and share growth from on! and announcements made at our Investor Day, including updates on our pending acquisition of NJOY, the unveiling of our exciting smoke-free products in development, and the introduction of our 2028 enterprise goals.\nLet's now review first quarter results in more detail, beginning with the macroeconomic environment and its impact on industry cigarette volumes. In the first quarter, consumer discretionary income levels remained under pressure due to the negative effect of higher inflation over the past year. As a reminder, the cigarette industry experienced a higher rate of volume decline beginning in the second quarter of 2022 as smokers shifted their purchasing behaviors as a result of widespread inflation and the rapid increase in gas prices that were exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While gas prices began to recede in the second half of last year, higher inflation persisted across other goods and services and cigarette volumes remain under pressure.\nMoving into the first quarter of 2023, the cumulative effects of inflation over the past several quarters continue to impact tobacco consumers, discretionary income and tobacco industry volumes. We will continue to monitor these factors and their impact on tobacco consumers as we progress throughout the year. Sal will provide additional color on industry volume in his remarks.\nLet's now turn to the oral tobacco category. We are excited by the continued growth of Oral Nicotine Pouch products, which grew their share of the total oral tobacco category for the 20th consecutive quarter. Oral nicotine pouches grew 7.1 share points year-over-year and now represent 26.2% of the oral tobacco category. Encouragingly, continued oral nicotine pouch growth was the primary contributor to the estimated 1% increase in total oral tobacco volumes over the past 6 months.\nHelix grew on! reported shipment volume to 25.2 million cans during the first quarter, an increase of 38%. on! continued its momentum at retail growing its share of total oral tobacco category by 2.4 share points to 6.5% and on! continue to grow its share of the nicotine pouch category reaching 24.6% in the first quarter, up 3.3 percentage points.\nNotably, on! outgrew then sequentially on an absolute basis in 50,000 stores. Helix delivered these impressive results as on!'s retail price grew 7% sequentially and 32% versus the year ago period. We believe on!'s ability to continue to grow share while effectively reducing its promotional investment demonstrates the strength of its product portfolio and brand equity. Helix is continuing its focus while strategically investing behind the brand as the category grows and remains committed to achieving profitability in 2025.\nLet's now move to e-vapor, which has been the most successful category in the U.S. in transitioning smokers to alternative products. We believe the category is continuing to undergo a significant reset, and we estimate that first quarter e-vapor volumes decreased 11% versus a year ago and 1% sequentially.\nWe have observed a decline in traditional multi-outlet and convenience channel volumes, which we believe is primarily a result of the FDA marketing denial orders issued for JUUL and MyBlu. This volume decline has been partially offset by increased volume in nontraditional channels, such as e-commerce and vape stores. We are excited about our pending acquisition of NJOY and its portfolio of e-vapor products. NJOY is the only company to receive a marketing granted order for pod-based product. We continue to believe the strength of our commercial resources can benefit smokers and vapors across the U.S. and expand smoke-free competition in stores where NJOY ACE has not been distributed. The completion of the NJOY transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance from the Federal Trade Commission.\nMoving to the regulatory environment. We remain optimistic about the future of harm-reduction in the U.S., and we continue to encourage the FDA to make more progress for the benefit of the $47 million tobacco consumers. In February, the FDA provided a response to the Reagan-Udall Foundation's assessment of FDA's tobacco operations. We are encouraged that the agency recognizes some important areas for improvement, including developing and communicating a 5-year strategic plan, improving transparency and defining more efficient product pathways, increasing enforcement of marketing denial orders, and exploring ways that the agency can and should address nicotine misperceptions through communications. We look forward to learning more details on these efforts.\nIn addition, FDA enforcement is critical to making continued progress toward reducing youth usage of e-vapor products. The FDA has the necessary enforcement tools. and we encourage them to take the appropriate action against noncompliant manufacturers. We continue to believe that harm-reduction, not prohibition, is the best path forward, and we have made this clear in the public comments we submitted in response to the FDA's proposed menthol ban. Our comments highlight the many unintended consequences of prohibition, including the adoption of adulterated and unregulated products and the development of illicit markets. Unfortunately, we believe a number of those consequences are playing out in California, where a ban on flavored nicotine products went into effect in late 2022.\nOur operating companies immediately [ ceased ] their shipment of products to California wholesalers that we determined were not compliant with the law. A brands continue to perform well in the state with Marlboro and Copenhagen growing retail share sequentially. However, we remain concerned with the lack of enforcement in the state as some flavored products remained in the market. We also believe some manufacturers have introduced new products, or rebranded existing ones to sidestep the purpose of the law.\nIn March, menthol cigarettes still represented nearly 40% of the volumes sold in the multi-outlet channel in California, an increase of 1.3 percentage points from January. Additionally, we have seen evidence that some California smokers are self-mentholating their cigarettes using alternative products such as flavor cards and menthol drops. We have also observed flavored e-vapor products in the market that appear to have been renamed to mislead state regulators. And trade dynamics in surrounded states suggest that some smokers are crossing state borders to purchase menthol products. For example, the share of menthol in Nevada increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially in the first quarter to 37.4%. We believe this is significant as the total share of menthol in Nevada has not been greater than 36.5% over the past 4 years.\nCompliance remains a top priority, and our government affairs teams are engaging with California government officials to encourage them to enhance enforcement and to hold all manufacturers to the same standard. Our goal is for policymakers to embrace harm-reduction as the proper framework for tobacco and nicotine product regulation. In fact, public opinion strongly favor harm-reduction over prohibition, and science shows a significant public health benefit of moving smokers away from combustible products toward a smoke-free future.\nAs we described at our Investor Day, we are continuing our efforts to create the conditions for harm-reduction to succeed through advocacy, engagement and our actions. I believe we are well positioned for success in 2023 and beyond. And while the external environment remains dynamic, I am confident that we have the tools in place to succeed. We have amazing brands, sound strategies and most importantly, talented indebted employees.\nWith these things in mind, we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS and in a range of $4.98 to $5.13. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.84 base in 2022 and excludes the potential financial impacts of the pending NJOY transaction.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Billy. In the smokeable products segment, we continue to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles over the long term while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro funding the growth of our smoke-free portfolio.\nSmokeable segment adjusted operating companies income was essentially unchanged, and the segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 60.4%, driven by strong net price realization of 10.9%. As a reminder, manufacturer price realization does not reflect the retail price change.\nAt retail, Marlboro's net pack price increased 6.8% in the first quarter compared to last year. Total smokeable segment reported shipment volumes declined by 11.1% in the first quarter, as an 11.4% decline in cigarette volumes was partially offset by modest growth in cigars. When adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the first quarter declined by 11% and that industry volumes declined by 9% over the same period.\nAs Billy mentioned, we believe that industry volume trends have been negatively impacted by the cumulative effects of higher inflation, and we expect volume declines to moderate over time as the macroeconomic environment stabilizes. At retail, the discount segment grew 1.8 share points in the first quarter and 0.5 sequentially. We believe some smokers today are trading down as a result of adverse financial conditions. We continue to see increased competitive activity in the discount segment, including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.\nMarlboro share declined 0.2 sequentially and 0.6 versus the year ago period, partially driven by the discount dynamics that I described, we have also seen a decline in Marlboro's menthol share of the total category as a result of the California flavor ban and increased competitive activity from premium menthol brands in the balance of the country. However, we believe that Marlboro remains the aspirational brand in the category as it retained the majority of its share in this challenging environment, growing its share of the premium segment to 58.5%, an increase of 0.1 sequentially and 0.7 year-over-year, while other brands ceded share in the segment.\nAnd we believe at PM USA has the appropriate tools to navigate this challenging environment. For example, we recently announced a series of investments behind the Marlboro Black family of products, which are intended to provide additional support for price-sensitive Marlboro smokers. Included in these investments is the introduction of Marlboro Black Gold pack non-menthol offerings with a smooth flavor and rich taste. These products are intended to bolster the offerings within the Marlboro Black family of products and will be available nationwide beginning in May.\nOur RGM and advanced analytics capabilities inform the geographies and promotional rates for these strategic investments, allowing us to be precise with our spend while supporting our overall strategy for the segment. And as a result of the flavor ban in California, PM USA shipments to California retailers declined 12.8% in the state while reported industry shipments to retailers declined 18.8%. We've included more details related to first quarter California market dynamics in our metrics document that is available on altria.com.\nMoving to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI grew 2.2% in the first quarter and the segment delivered strong adjusted OCI margins of 69.3%. Total segment reported shipment volume decreased 1.8% as growth in on! was more than offset by lower MST volumes. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, we estimate that first quarter oral tobacco segment volumes declined by an estimated 3%. Oral Tobacco Products segment retail share declined 1.8 percentage points as declines in our MST brands were partially offset by the continued growth of on!. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! continued to grow share in the category and Copenhagen remained the category leader.\nTurning to our investment in ABI. We recorded $180 million of adjusted equity earnings for the quarter, up 28%. We continue to view the ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1. In February, we retired $1.3 billion of notes that came due with available cash. And as part of the IQOS agreement we announced last fall, we expect to receive the remaining $1.7 billion plus interest from Philip Morris International by July of this year.\nWe remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our focus on significant capital returns. We demonstrated this commitment in the first quarter, by paying approximately $1.7 billion in dividends and announcing a new progressive dividend goal that targets mid-single-digit dividend growth annually through 2028. Due to the timing of our announcement of the NJOY transaction, we did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter. As of March 31, we had $1 billion remaining under the current share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year.\nWith that, we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.\nLet's now open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and the question-and-answer session.\nRepresentatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of IR, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Todd. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's fourth quarter and full year business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility report are all available at altria.com.\nDuring our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2021. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.\nFuture dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis.\nAdjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.\nFinally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was an exciting year for Altria as our businesses delivered strong financial performance, and we continue to strategically invest toward our vision. We grew our adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5%, and our tobacco businesses remain resilient and successfully executed their strategies.\nWe also returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last year, we returned more than $8.4 billion to shareholders, outpacing our record returns from 2021 and representing the largest single year cash return since 2002. Our vision guided our actions, and we believe we made meaningful progress on our journey toward moving beyond smoking.\nOur teams took several steps forward during the year, including accelerating the growth of all nicotine pouches, creating long-term optionality for our inhalable smoke-free product portfolio, enhancing our digital consumer engagement and continuing to advocate for tobacco harm reduction. Helix grew on reported shipment volume to 82.5 million cans during its first full year of unconstrained manufacturing capacity, an increase of more than 70% versus the prior year. At retail, on! share momentum continued in the fourth quarter as the brand reached 5.9% of the total oral tobacco category and 24% of the nicotine pouch category.\nThis impressive performance was driven by continued increases in brand awareness and adoption by smokers and dippers. Additionally, we believe Helix effectively managed on! promotional spend as the year progressed and reduced on! promotional spend per can by approximately 15% during the second half of the year compared to the first half.\nIn all tobacco product development, we are excited to announce we have finalized a new product design, which will provide tobacco consumers more smoke-free options within our portfolio. We also began regulatory preparations for the product, and we are encouraged by the initial research results and the response we have received from Dippers and nicotine pouch users. We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling this innovative product at our Investor Day next month.\nTurning to our inhalable smoke-free portfolio. We created long-term optionality in the heated tobacco and e-vapor spaces. Internally, we have not yet finalized the design of our heated tobacco capsule product, but our teams continue to make progress. The consumer remains the focal point of our innovation system and our teams are tailoring the product to appeal to smokers who have not yet found a satisfying alternative to cigarettes.\nWe also look forward to unveiling this exciting new product at our Investor Day next month as well. And in October, we announced a strategic partnership with JT Group, including a joint venture for the U.S. commercialization of heated tobacco stick products. We're encouraged by the initial collaboration between our teams and the pace at which they are operating.\nHorizon is optimizing team for the U.S. market and plans to begin regulatory preparations later this year. We're excited about the opportunity and are working diligently to bring Ploom to smokers in the U.S. In e-vapor, we previously announced we elected to be released from the noncompete obligations related to our JUUL investment. We retain our economic stake in JUUL. E-vapor remains the largest smoke-free category in the U.S. and the most successful category in transitioning U.S. smokers away from cigarettes.\nWe believe the category can play an important role in harouction, and we're continuing to evaluate all options to best compete in the category. Next, let's discuss the progress we made to enhance our digital consumer engagement. We launched a new digital trade program last spring, and we believe this program enhances our ongoing commitment to responsible retail.\nThe program includes multiple participation options for retailers. For those participating at the highest level, we introduced incentives for retailers to include age and identity verification solutions in their digital platforms. And once the consumer is verified retailers can then provide offers and messaging from our brands within the retailer's app.\nI'm excited to share that we implemented these solutions in more than 33,000 stores exceeding the goal we outlined last year at CAGNY. Currently, consumers can view offers from our smokeable and most smokeless tobacco brands. But going forward, we expect to expand the program to include on! and other smoke-free brands.\nAs we continue to broaden our digital reach, data will help us better understand each smoker's journey and help them successfully transition to other smoke-free alternatives in our portfolio. Moving to the regulatory environment. We remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the U.S. We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers to smoke-free alternatives if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation.\nIn December, the Reagan-Udall Foundation published its operational evaluation of the FDA's Sinofert tobacco products. We were among the stakeholders who provided input into this evaluation. Among its recommendation, the report urges the FDA to fully defined product pathways and accelerate PMT decision-making, take enforcement actions against manufacturers and product and violation of the law and address the need for risk communications to tobacco consumers.\nWe agree these are important opportunities and believe that the FDA should direct its focus toward implementing a framework to advance harm reduction, rather than focusing on prohibition policies that we believe will further expand the illicit market and create other unintended consequences.\nLet's now move to the operating environment. We estimate that total equivalized tobacco volumes declined 6% for the year and 1.7% over the past 5 years on a compounded annual basis. Combustible volumes declined by an estimated 7.8% last year as smokers faced increasing economic challenges. We are encouraged that smoke-free volumes were stable compared to the prior year at 3.8 billion equivalized units and now represent an estimated 26% of the total tobacco space.\nE-Vapor has been a major contributor to the growth of smoke-free products over the 5-year period. Although volumes declined by an estimated 1% year-over-year amid considerable regulatory uncertainty such as the FDA's marketing from denial order and subsequent temporary stay on fuel products, which caused market disruptions for both consumers and retailers. In old tobacco, volumes grew by an estimated 1.5% driven by the continued adoption of all nicotine pouches. Turning to our financial outlook, our plans for 2023 include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with strategic investments towards our vision.\nFor 2023, our planned investment areas include continued smoke-free product research,development and regulatory preparations, digital consumer engagement, and marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products. We believe the external environment will remain dynamic in 2023. We will continue to monitor the economy, including the impact of high inflation, tobacco consumer dynamics and regulatory and legislative developments.\nConsidering these factors, we expect to deliver 2023 Full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.98 to $5.13. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.84 base in 2022.\nBefore I turn it over to Sal, I would like to send a sincere thank you to our employees. I continue to be impressed by the talent within our companies and our ability to adapt and overcome challenges in a dynamic operating environment. The passion and dedication of our employee base is evident, and I'm confident in our ability to execute our vision because of you.\nAlso, I'd like to honor the memory of Leo Cole, the long-standing member of our Board who recently passed away. Leo served on our Board since 2011 and made many contributions to Altria, including as Chair of the Compensation and Talent Development Committee and as a member of the Innovation Committee. We will miss his leadership, guidance and friendship. I'll now turn it over to Sal.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Billy. We were very fortunate to have Leo's 12 years of service at Altria and our thoughts remain with the Kyle family. Moving to our results. Our tobacco businesses generated strong financial performance again this year and were responsive to changes in a dynamic external environment. In the fourth quarter, the smokeable products segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by 4% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 58.4%. The segment also reported robust net price realization of 13.5%.\nAs a reminder, manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price changes for smokers. For example, Marlboro net retail path price increased 6.4% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We continue to successfully execute against our strategy in the smokable segment, maximizing profitability while balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products.\nFor the full year, smokeable segment adjusted OCI grew 2.9% to $10.7 billion, and adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.4 percentage points to 59%. In smokeable segment, net price realization for the year was 11.1%. In addition, over the past 5 years, the smokeable segment has grown adjusted OCI by $2.2 billion representing a compounded annual growth rate of 4.7%.\nOver the same time period, adjusted OCI margins have expanded from 51% to 59%, an impressive increase of 8 percentage points. Turning to volumes. Our smokeable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 9.7% for the full year. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, domestic cigarette volumes for the fourth quarter and full year declined by an estimated 11% and 9.5%, respectively. At the industry level, when adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 9% in the fourth quarter and by 8% for the full year.\nNext, let's discuss retail share performance. Full year retail share for the industry discount segment increased 1.4 share points. We believe these results were driven by an increased pressure on smokers disposable income and increased competitive activity, including multiple branded discount offerings priced at deep discount levels.\nMarlboro retail share declined by 4/10 for the full year. Most of the full year share losses were attributable to the value options within the Marlboro brand family, such as Special Select and Marlboro 72s as some price-sensitive consumers continue to seek additional price relief. Meanwhile, the brand's mainline non-menthol offerings, including the iconic red and gold varieties were resilient and performed well for the year.\nMarlboro's share of the premium segment grew to 58.2% for the full year. Marlboro has performed better than many other premium brands over the last several years. In fact, over the past 3 years, Marlboro grew its share of premium by 1 full share point. We are encouraged by Marlboro's resilient performance as the brand celebrates 50 years of leadership in the cigarette category.\nIn cigars, reported cigar shipment volume decreased 4% for the full year. While Black & Mild continued to maintain its leadership in a profitable machine-made tip cigar segment. Next, we will move to the oral tobacco products segment. Full year segment adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted as we continue to invest behind on!. Total segment reported shipment volume declined 2.4% for the year as growth in on! volume, which more than offset by lower reported MST volumes.\nWhen adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that full year total oral tobacco segment volumes declined by an estimated 2%. Full year oral tobacco products segment retail share declined 1.3 percentage points as declines in MST were partially offset by the continued growth of on!. Within the traditional smokeless category of MST and snus products, Copenhagen's share performance has been stable over the last 3 years, declining only 0.3 from 2019, whereas the second largest traditional smokeless brand has ceded 1.6 share points.\nOverall, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of our oral tobacco products as on! grew volume and share in a competitive category and Copenhagen remain the category leader. Turning to our investment in ABI. We recorded $571 million of adjusted equity earnings for the full year, down 10.6% versus 2021.\nWe continue to view the ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal remains to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. In our all Other operating category, we have completed our wind down of Philip Morris Capital Corporation and no finance assets remain. I would like to thank the many PMCC employees who contributed to its success over the years and to the other Altria employees who helped complete a successful wind down.\nFinally, we continue to effectively manage our balance sheet while generating strong financial performance and returning significant cash to shareholders. These results were driven by our tobacco businesses that continue to be highly cash generative. Our year-end credit metrics remain strong. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, down four tenths over the past 3 years, and our weighted average coupon was 4%, a decrease of 0.2 over the past 3 years.\nWe also expect to retire approximately $1.3 billion of notes coming through later this month with available cash. In addition, we returned more than $8.4 billion in cash to shareholders last year through dividends and share repurchases. These record cash returns included paying $6.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 57 time in 53 years.\nWe also repurchased more than 38 million shares during the year totaling $1.8 billion, which completed our previously authorized program. Earlier this week, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete by the end of 2023. I'll now turn it back to Billy to conclude our remarks.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sal. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. As we mentioned during the call, we have exciting topics to discuss at our Investor Day next month. We look forward to having a fulsome conversation about our smoke-free future and we are excited to share more about our journey toward moving beyond smoking. Todd will now transition to the Q&A period.",

(Operator Instructions) Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.

This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's third quarter and first 9-month business results.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This is an exciting moment on our journey towards moving beyond smoking. Our tobacco businesses remained resilient during the first 9 months of the year, and we continue to reward shareholders while making investments in pursuit of our vision.\nWe have deepened our consumer understanding, enhanced our capability and built the science to support smoker transition away from cigarettes.\nThe tobacco harm reduction opportunity remains in front of us, and we continue to believe Altria is uniquely positioned to responsibly lead adult smokers to a smoke-free future. Our remarks this morning will focus on our progress to date and several exciting steps we have recently taken that we believe will accelerate our progress toward harm reduction. I will then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further details on our business and financial results.\nLet's begin with the heated tobacco category. Last week, we entered into an agreement with Philip Morris International, under which we will receive $2.7 billion in cash in exchange for assigning our exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the IQOS system at the end of April 2024. We believe this agreement provides us with fair compensation and greater flexibility to allocate resources toward moving beyond smoking. The heated tobacco category is still undeveloped in the U.S., and we believe we can lead in this space supported by our robust infrastructure and deep understanding of the U.S. tobacco consumers.\nThis morning, we announced the pursuit of a global smoke free partnership with JT Group. We signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with JT signifying the commitment of both parties towards further smoke-free collaboration. JT is a leading international tobacco company committed to investing and growing reduced risk products. We believe that together, Altria and JT can accelerate global harm reduction by collaborating on product development and global commercialization of smoke-free products.\nWe believe this potential collaboration can leverage the strengths and resources of both companies to transition more smokers away from cigarettes. As a first step in this partnership, we announced the formation of Horizon Innovations, a joint venture between Altria and JT for the U.S. commercialization of heated tobacco stick or HTS products. We believe that HTS products can appeal to certain smokers as they provide a more familiar, tactile and sensorial experience to cigarettes.\nUnder the terms of the JV, both parties will combine their scientific and regulatory expertise to jointly prepare PMTA filings for the latest version of the Ploom HTS products which are not yet commercially available. The parties expect to file a PMTA in the first half of 2025. Upon authorization, Horizon will become the exclusive entity through which the parties market and commercialize stick products in the U.S.\nJTI will supply Ploom Heated Tobacco Stick devices. And PM USA will manufacture Marlboro HTS consumables for U.S. commercialization. The parties have agreed to commercialization milestones for Horizon, which include distribution requirements and minimal levels of cumulative marketing investment.\nUnder the financial terms of the JT, PM USA has a 75% economic interest in Horizon with JTI having 25%. We're excited about the prospect of introducing the latest version of Ploom HTS products to U.S. smokers. JT has demonstrated success innovating in the heated tobacco space. For example, JT launched Ploom X last year in Japan. And since its introduction, JT's doubled its share of the Japanese HTS segment. JT estimates that there are more than 1 million Ploom X consumers. And according to their research, these consumers perceive Ploom X as a stylish, credible and unique brand.\nConsumers also describe the product as easy to use. We look forward to bringing the newest version of this exciting product to U.S. smokers. We have discussed our increased focus and investment on an internal wholly owned heated tobacco product development. Our approach puts the consumer at the center of everything that we do. We receive more data on their preferences, purchasing patterns and friction points than we ever have.\nAdditionally, we embedded our regulatory sciences team early in the process to align our product development efforts with FDA expectations. We believe these efforts are building a promising pipeline of wholly owned heated tobacco products and intellectual property consisting of heated tobacco capsule or HTC formats and new-to-market technologies. We believe capsule products can appeal to smokers who are open to novel, smoke-free products but have not yet found a satisfying alternative to cigarettes. This audience includes the millions of U.S. smokers who tried but ultimately rejected e-vapor products.\nWe expect to finalize the design of our first capsule product by the end of this year, and we expect to follow PMTA by the end of 2024. We also expect to partner with JT to launch this product in an international test market using JT's sales and distribution network. We plan to share more on this product platform once the design is finalized.\nWe believe moving beyond smoking in the U.S. requires multiple FDA-authorized products within a smoke-free category to appeal to a diverse range of smokers and help them transition away from cigarettes. We believe that our pipeline of heated tobacco products and partnership with JT combined with the internal capabilities I described earlier, positions us well to increase adoption of smoke-free products for the millions of smokers interested in these products.\nLet's now move to the e-vapor category. In the third quarter, total estimated e-vapor volumes declined by 4% versus a year ago and were flat sequentially. we believe the regulatory uncertainty related to JUUL caused market disruptions in the quarter, and we observed a reduction in JUUL purchases throughout the supply chain. We previously disclosed that we have exercised our option to be released from our noncompete obligations related to our JUUL investment. While we retain our 35% economic stake in JUUL, we're exploring all options to build an FDA-authorized portfolio of e-vapor products that will help smokers transition away from cigarettes.\nFor example, our teams are conducting consumer research, performing external scans and evaluating internal product development options. We're excited about the opportunity to increase our participation in the largest smoke-free category in the U.S. Turning to oral tobacco. We remain encouraged by the growth of novel oral tobacco products, which grew its share of the total oral tobacco category for the 18th consecutive quarter. The category grew 6.5 share points year-over-year and now represents approximately 23% of the overall oral tobacco category.\nIn the third quarter, on! reported shipment volume increased nearly 70% to 21 million cans. And on! retail share increased 0.3 sequentially reaching 5.2 share points of the oral tobacco category in the third quarter. We believe these strong results were driven by increased brand awareness and adoption of on!, supported by continued equity and promotional investment.\nBuilding on its second quarter launch of the [carry on!] brand equity campaign, Helix recently introduced on! Rewards, a digital program that enables on! consumers to track the rewards balance online and redeem their points for coupons or other items. We're excited about on!'s continued momentum, increasing brand loyalty and the opportunity for future growth.\nLet's now turn to our view of the regulatory environment. We continue to believe that more should be done to advance harm reduction in the U.S. and that the FDA should move more deliberately toward creating a market of authorized smoke-free products to help accelerate smoker transition away from cigarettes. The fact remains that today, only a small percentage of e-vapor volume has been authorized and no oral nicotine pouch products have received market authorization.\nWe believe collaboration and accountability from all stakeholders are required for this market transition to take place. We also believe that smoke-free products should serve as an offering for smokers, not an on ramp for youth users. We remain encouraged that youth smoking rates in the U.S. are at the lowest levels ever recorded.\nIn fact, the latest Monitoring The Future study estimated that in 2021, the combined past 30-day smoking rates among 8th, 10th and 12th graders was 2.3%, a nearly 92% reduction from its 1997 peak. Additionally, data from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey indicate that while e-vapor usage remains high among middle and high schoolers, the levels were significantly lower than the peak observed in 2019. Per the 2022 NYTS survey, 50% of the middle and high school current e-vapor users indicated that they most often use disposable e-cigarettes such as Puff Bar.\nMoving forward, we hope to see timely science and evidence-based determinations on pending PMTA applications across all smoke-free categories and further enforcement on noncompliant manufacturers. Our journey towards responsibly moving beyond smoking continues, and we are optimistic that the actions we have taken to date have strengthened our portfolio into 3 major smoke free categories. We have built a compelling portfolio in the heated tobacco, enhanced our ability to compete in e-vapor and continue to strengthen on!'s position in the oral tobacco category.\nAnd we believe that we are able to maximize the value of these actions by leveraging our existing scale and infrastructure, such as our manufacturing centers and sales force. For example, our flagship Richmond manufacturing center began production of oral nicotine pouches in 2020.\nWe now expect to add production of heated tobacco sticks for our new JV. Our sales and distribution system driven by our world-class sales force gives us the ability to responsibly market products in over 200,000 stores.\nAnd we have decades of experience navigating dynamic U.S. regulatory and political environments through the strength of our regulatory and government affairs organizations. These functions, together with our many other talented employees, gives me confidence that we can achieve our vision.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to thank Leo Kiely for his distinguished service to Altria's Board. Leo has served on the Board since 2011 and will retire at the completion of his term early next year. I'd also like to welcome Jase Hernandez to our Board of Directors effective November 1. Jase brings a significant and deep understanding of the tobacco landscape following his years as an investment analyst covering the tobacco industry. Jase will serve on the finance and innovation committees. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Billy. I'd like to begin with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on U.S. tobacco consumers. In the third quarter, consumer discretionary income levels remained under pressure as higher gas prices and inflation persisted. However, we saw signs of continued brand loyalty in the tobacco space. In September, we conducted research to understand how tobacco consumers were managing their spending in several categories, including tobacco, alcohol, groceries and household items.\nOur research indicates that tobacco consumers continue to stick with their preferred tobacco brands at a higher rate compared to other categories when experiencing higher prices. These results were consistent with the results from our previous surveys. We believe Inflation and the rise in gas prices was partially offset for some consumers by a strong job market and wage growth. Overall, average wages increased 6.9% in the third quarter compared to an average 8.3% increase in CPI.\nAnd for some occupations, including the service industry, wage growth outpaced inflation. We continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and changes in marketplace conditions. Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our core businesses performed extremely well in the third quarter, underpinned by the strength of our premium brands: Marlboro, Copenhagen and Black & Mild continued to grow profitably. And on!'s momentum and growth reflected strong positioning in the marketplace.\nThis strong business performance, combined with fewer shares outstanding, drove Altria's adjusted diluted earnings per share results. Altria grew adjusted diluted EPS by 4.9% in the third quarter and by 4% in the first 9 months. Turning to our business results. The smokable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. The segment grew with adjusted operating company's income by 1.8% in the third quarter and by 2.6% in the first 9 months.\nThe smokeable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 58.9%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points for the third quarter and 1.2 percentage points for the first 9 months. This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 10.2% in the third quarter and 10.3% for the first 9 months. I'll remind you that manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price change for smokers.\nFor example, Marlboro price per packet retail increased 6% in the third quarter compared to last year, which was below overall inflation for the quarter. Multiple segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 9.2% in the third quarter and 9% for the first 9 months, driven in part by the continued macroeconomic pressures I described. When adjusted for trade inventory movement and other factors, domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first 9 months declined by an estimated 10% and 9.5%, respectively.\nAt the industry level, we estimate that the adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the third quarter and by 7.5% in the first 9 months. We believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one period can be influenced by various factors. In fact, Q3 year-to-date adjusted industry cigarette volumes have declined by an average of 4.5% over the past 5 years.\nIn the third quarter, the total discount segment retail share of the cigarette category increased 1.6 percentage points versus the year ago period and 0.7 sequentially, reflecting increased competitive activity and the challenging macroeconomic environment. We are encouraged that the discount segment share growth largely sourced from (technical difficulty) sequentially and 0.4 versus the year ago period. We are pleased with Marlboro's performance and stability over the long term.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Marlboro's retail share was 42.5 percentage points. We believe that increased discretionary income driven in part by government stimulus checks and lower consumer mobility led to an increase in Marlboro's retail share throughout the pandemic. As consumer mobility returned to pre-pandemic levels, and federal stimulus checks ended, Marlboro's share returned to its pre-pandemic levels and has remained stable through the subsequent quarters.\nIn fact, since the first quarter of 2020, Marlboro has performed better than many of the other premium brands in the category. As a result, Marlboro continued to grow its share of the premium segment to 58.4%, an increase of 0.4 sequentially and 0.7 versus a year ago. We believe its performance over the long term is a testament to its positioning within the premium segment as the aspirational brand with strong consumer loyalty.\nIn cigars, reported cigar shipment volume increased by 3.3% in the third quarter. Black & Mild continued its long-standing leadership in the profitable tipped cigar segment and Middleton continued to provide a strong contribution to smokable segment financial results.\nTurning to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI grew 4.9% in the third quarter, but declined 3.4% for the first 9 months, primarily due to higher investments behind on!. We're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and excited about on!'s performance in the marketplace. Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased by 1.3% for the third quarter and decreased 1.8% for the first 9 months.\nWhen adjusted for trade inventory movement and calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2% for the third quarter and 1.5% for the first 9 months. Oral Tobacco Products segment retail share declined 1.5 percentage points as declines in MST were partially offset by the continued growth of on!.\nTurning to our investment in ABI. We recorded a noncash, pretax impairment charge of approximately $2.5 billion for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022. This impairment reflects the difference between the fair value and carrying value of our investment in ABI as of September 30. We continue to believe that ABI's share price performance is not reflective of its underlying long-term equity value and that ABI's share price will recover.\nHowever, we believe that it will take longer than previously expected as macroeconomic and geopolitical factors may continue to impact foreign exchange rates and ABI's financial results and share price performance in the near term. As we have previously shared, we view our ABI's stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders.\nWe remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns, which we demonstrated in the third quarter by paying approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 57th time in 53 years and repurchasing 8.5 million shares totaling $368 million. We have approximately $375 million remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year.\nOur balance sheet remains strong and as of the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x. In August, we retired $1.1 billion of notes that came due with available cash. As Billy stated, we will receive $2.7 billion as a part of the IQOS agreement. We received $1 billion upon entry into the agreement and will receive the remaining $1.7 billion plus interest by July of 2023.\nOur expected use of the cash proceeds may include investments in pursuit of our vision debt repayment, share repurchases or general corporate purposes. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors and remains subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year 2022 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.81 to $4.89. This range represents growth of 4.5% to 6% from a base of $4.61 in 2021. We believe this range allows us the flexibility to react to marketplace conditions. With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions.\nWhile the polls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of IR, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ashley. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's second quarter and first half business results.\nEarlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com. During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2021. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results.\nPlease review the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board.\nAltria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com.\nFinally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Altria's tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment for the first half of the year. The smokeable products segment delivered solid operating company's income growth behind the resilience of Marlboro, and our moist smokeless tobacco brands continued to drive profitability.\nWe also continue to make progress toward our vision through the investments we laid out in January, which included supporting the expansion of on!. We are encouraged by on!'s retail momentum and significant share growth since achieving unconstrained capacity last summer. We believe this is a pivotal point in the U.S. tobacco industry. The FDA has the opportunity to create a mature, regulated marketplace of smoke-free products that can successfully realize tobacco harm-reduction and improve the lives of millions of smokers.\nWe share the FDA's goal, to transition smokers away from cigarettes, but we continue to believe that harm-reduction, not prohibition is the best path forward. My remarks this morning will focus on 3 topics: our core tobacco businesses, including the macroeconomic backdrop and potential combustible tobacco product regulation; the smoke-free opportunity in the U.S. and our smoke-free product portfolio; and our continued confidence in our vision. I'll then turn it over to Sal, who will provide further detail on our business and financial results.\nLet's begin with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on U.S. tobacco consumers. In the second quarter, rising gas prices and inflation continue to pressure tobacco consumers' disposable income, resulting in volume declines across the tobacco space. However, we believe that tobacco consumers adapted their purchasing patterns across a variety of goods and services to compensate for the increases in prices. Some of the tactics used by consumers to manage their spending included only partially filling the gas tank and shifting their tobacco purchases from multipack towards single-pack purchases particularly among discount smokers.\nWe also saw signs of continued brand loyalty in the tobacco space. In May, we conducted research to understand how tobacco consumers were managing their spending in several categories, including tobacco, alcohol, groceries and household items. Our research indicates that tobacco consumers are more likely to stick to their preferred brand regardless of price in the tobacco category compared to other categories. Additionally, tobacco consumers saw price relief in other categories before doing so within the tobacco category. We believe that this prioritization is reflected in the sequential stability of Marlboro retail share despite greater economic pressures on consumers. We believe inflation and the rising gas prices was partially offset for some consumers by a strong job market and wage growth.\nOverall, average wages increased 5.2% in the second quarter compared to an average of 8.6% increase in CPI. And for some occupations including the service industry, wage growth outpaced inflation. We continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and changes in marketplace conditions, such as the declining gas price that we have observed in recent weeks, and we will continue to provide our insights as the year progresses. These macroeconomic factors contributed to accelerated cigarette volume declines in the second quarter and first half, which Sal will discuss in his remarks.\nIn combustible regulatory news, the FDA proposed rules that would ban menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. The FDA has already received over 200,000 comments on the proposals, and we expect to submit our comments by the August 2 deadline. The FDA will need to address all of these comments before advancing to the next step in the rule-making process. As our comments will make clear, we believe that there are compelling reasons for the FDA to reconsider its proposed rules relating to menthol and cigars.\nAdditionally, the Biden administration announced plans for future FDA rule-making to develop a product standard that would set a maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. If and when the FDA proceeds with rule-making, we expect to be fully engaged in the multiyear process. We believe harm-reduction is the best approach toward reducing smoking and improving public health. And according to a nationwide survey, others agree.\nBased on our research, a majority of the survey public policy professionals, smokers and general population adults support the concept of tobacco harm-reduction and prefer this policy approach over tobacco prohibition. But to achieve harm-reduction, we believe manufacturers must develop and the FDA must authorized an array of potentially reduced harm products that can appeal to and transition smokers.\nThis brings me to my next topic, the smoke-free opportunity in the U.S. and our smoke-free product portfolio. Today, over 20 million U.S. smokers seek less harmful alternatives to cigarettes. Our strategy is to deliver a compelling portfolio of smoke-free products that offers a range of satisfying product choices for smokers and to responsibly lead them to these alternatives.\nOur approach spans 3 of the most promising smoke-free categories with the potential to reduce harm: oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco. In oral tobacco, we're encouraged by the growth of the novel oral products, which comprise more than 1/5 of total industry oral tobacco volume in the second quarter. The category grew 6.8 share points year-over-year, with on! representing more than 40% of this growth. In the second quarter, on! reported shipment volume increased nearly 60% versus the year ago period. And on! retail share of oral tobacco increased 8/10 sequentially, reaching 4.9 share points in the second quarter. This represents a growth rate of almost 150% year-over-year. These strong results were driven by increased adoption of on!, increased brand awareness and higher levels of investment.\nHelix achieved unconstrained on! manufacturing for the current U.S. market in the second quarter of 2021. Over the 4 quarters since then, Helix enhanced the retail visibility and awareness of on!, leading to an over 70% increase in consumer awareness, tripled on! repurchases and continue to increase trial using transition marketing and data-driven strategies. And grew on! retail share to be a top 5 U.S. oral tobacco brand and solidified its position as the second largest oral nicotine pouch brand in each region of the U.S.\nMore recently, Helix launched the new Carry On Equity campaign, which encourages smokers to make progress in their transition journey. The campaign highlights that by converting to on!, smokers can have nicotine satisfaction without having to step away from their daily routines, which addresses the social friction they experience with smoking.\nLooking ahead, Helix expects to use its understanding of the smoker journey, the smoke-free products to drive repeat purchases and adoption among smokers. We are excited about the performance of on! and the opportunity for future growth.\nI'll now move to the e-vapor category, which we continue to believe will be significantly influenced by regulatory actions. In the second quarter, total estimated e-vapor volumes declined 2% versus a year ago and 7% sequentially as a result of decreased volume in the vape store channel, a reversal of the trend we observed in the first quarter. Currently, slightly over half of the category's volume is comprised of pod-based products such as JUUL and Vuse Alto.\nWithin e-vapor, disposables represent the fastest growth segment since January 2020, which corresponds to when the FDA issued in its guidance banning flavors only in pod-based e-vapor products. Many of these disposable brands, including Puff Bar contain synthetic nicotine. Recent legislation, which we strongly supported, clarified the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products containing nicotine from any source.\nManufacturers of synthetic nicotine products were required to obtain FDA authorization by July 13 to continue legally marketing their products. So far, no synthetic nicotine product has been granted authorization. And the FDA has committed to pursuing compliance and enforcement action against companies found to be marketing, selling or distributing illegal synthetic nicotine products.\nThus far, the FDA has authorized only 23 total e-vapor applications, accounting for only 8 products and approximately 1% of estimated e-vapor category volume. Further, the FDA has only authorized tobacco-flavored e-vapor products, most of which were for cigalike-style products, which we believe generally do not meet smoker expectations or deliver a satisfying product experience. Given the limited number of authorizations today, we believe that the e-vapor category is still in its early phases.\nBut with the support of reasonable regulations, we believe it could play in important role in harm-reduction. Moving forward, we hope to see timely science and evidence-based determinations from pending PMTA application and further enforcement or noncompliant manufacturers. In the second quarter, JUUL products received marketing denial orders, or MDOs. Earlier this month, the FDA administratively stayed the JUUL MDOs citing unique scientific issues that warrant additional FDA review. The administrative stay temporarily suspend the MDOs during the additional review, but does not rescind them.\nRegarding our investment in JULL, we recorded for the second quarter a noncash pretax unrealized loss of $1.2 billion as a result of a decrease in the estimated fair value of our investment. The decrease in fair value was driven by several factors including uncertainty created by the FDA's action related to JUUL and uncertainty relating to JUUL's ability to maintain adequate liquidity. As of June 30, our estimated valuation is $450 million, which reflects a range of regulatory, liquidity and market outcomes. Under the terms of our relationship agreement with JUUL, we have the option to be released from our non-compete obligation under several conditions including the fair value of our investments, if the fair value of our investment is not more than 10% of the initial carrying value of $12.8 billion.\nHowever, if we elect to be released from our noncompete obligations, we would lose many of our investment rights, including our consent rights, our preemptive rights, and most of our Board designation rights. At this time, we continue to believe that these investment rights are beneficial to us. Therefore, we have not opted to be released from our non-compete obligations at this time, but retain the option to do so in the future in accordance with our agreement with JUUL. We continue to believe that e-vapor products, including JUUL, can play an important role in tobacco harm-reduction.\nIn heated tobacco, our teams remain in discussions with PMI related to IQOS. We continue to believe in the potential of the heated tobacco category in the U.S. Our plans remain on track to finalize designs by year-end for 2 product platforms within heated and oral tobacco and then begin regulatory preparations.\nOur journey towards responsibly transition adult smokers to a smoke-free future continues. And while we may face near-term challenges, we believe that the tobacco harm-reduction opportunity remains in front of us. As the leader in the U.S. tobacco industry, we have continued confidence in our ability to achieve our vision for several reasons, including our robust manufacturing, sales and distribution system and understanding of U.S. tobacco consumers.\nOur science-based approach to tobacco harm reduction, which we believe is aligned with tobacco consumers, society and the FDA. Our portfolio of products and investments across the most promising smoke-free categories and our significant cash flows and flexible balance sheet, which support our investments and shareholder returns. With these in mind and the resiliency of our organization, we believe we can lead the U.S. in moving beyond smoking.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Billy. Altria grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 2.4% in the second quarter and by 3.5% in the first half across the challenging macroeconomic environment that Billy described. The smokeable product segment continue to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. The segment grew its adjusted operating company's income by 0.6% in the second quarter, and 2.9% first half. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 0.7 percentage points to 59.1% for the second quarter and by 1.33 percentage points to 59.3% for the first half. This performance was supported by robust net price realization of 11.5% in the second quarter and 10.4% for the first half.\nI'll remind you that manufacturer price realization does not reflect retail price change for smokers. For example, Marlboro net retail pack price increased 5.6% in the second quarter compared to last year. Smokeable products segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 11.1% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first half, primarily due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior as a result of increased gas prices and inflation. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and factors, second quarter and first half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 10% and 9%, respectively.\nAt the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.5% in the second quarter and 7.5% in the first half. As Billy mentioned Marlboro displayed resiliency during a period of continued uncertainty for consumers. In the second quarter, Marlboro's retail share of the cigarette category grew 1/10 sequentially to 42.7% while declining 4/10 versus the year ago period. Additionally, Marlboro grew its share within the premium segment to 58.1%, an increase of 3/10 sequentially and 5/10 versus a year ago.\nMoving to the total discount segment. Total share was flat sequentially even as gas prices rose significantly from the first to second quarter. Discount increased 1.3 percentage points year-over-year to 26.4% as we lapped the period when the discount segment contracted from smokers having higher disposable income. Additionally, we observed increased churn between the branded and deep discount segments as a result of a deep discount manufacturer's exit from the marketplace earlier this year.\nIn cigars, reported cigar shipment volume decreased by 5% in the second quarter due to macroeconomic pressures on consumer, disposable income, trade inventory movements and other factors. However Middleton continue to provide a strong contribution to smokeable segment financial results. In the oral tobacco product segment, adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted in the second quarter and first half due to several factors, including declines in MST volumes, increased investments behind on! and unfavorable mix. We remain pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment as we made progress with on!.\nAt the industry level, tobacco oral tobacco volume declined 0.5% over the past 6 months. We continue to observe steady growth from the oral nicotine pouch category, but this has been offset by declining MST volumes due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and its effect on consumer behavior, consumer movement to oral nicotine pouches and other factors.\nTotal segment reported shipment volume decreased by 4.4% for the second quarter and by 3.2% for the first half. The segment's volume was -- volume decline was driven by declines in MST volumes, partially offset by the growth of on!. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, segment volume declined by an estimated 2.5% for the second quarter and 1% for the first half. The total oral tobacco product segment's retail share for the second quarter contracted 2/10 sequentially and 1 share point versus the prior year to 46.7%.\nCopenhagen is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. We're extremely proud of Copenhagen's long history and the fantastic employees who have supported the brand over the years. To them, we say thank you. After 200 years, Copenhagen remains the #1 dip brand because of your hard work, dedication and passion. To honor this impressive milestone, the team introduced Cop Rewards, the first and only national rewards program for an MST brand. Under the program, dippers can earn points by entering codes from their Copenhagen cans and can redeem them for coupons or rewards. We're excited about Cop Rewards and its potential contributions to Copenhagen's sustained leadership in MST.\nTurning to our investment in ABI. We recorded $124 million of adjusted equity earnings in the second quarter. This was an increase of approximately 9.7% from the year ago period and represent Altria's share of ABI's first quarter 2022 results. We committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our focus on significant capital returns. We demonstrated this commitment in the first half by acquiring intellectual property and other assets for a multi substrate heated capsule technology from Poda. Paying approximately $3.3 billion in dividends and repurchasing 21.4 million shares, totaling $1.1 billion.\nWe have approximately $750 million remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by the end of this year. Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3x. In August, we expect to retire $1.1 billion of notes coming due with available cash.\nAnd lastly, our financial plans for the year remain on track and we reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.79 to $4.93. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 4% to 7% from a $4.61 base in 2021. With that, we'll wrap up and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions.\nWhile the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available all on altria.com We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.\nLet's open the question-and-answer period.

Today's call is scheduled to last about an hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of IR, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gretchen. Good morning and thank you for joining us.\nThis morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's first quarter business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com.

Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mac.\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. We're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full year plans. Our tobacco businesses performed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we continue to make progress toward our vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.\nLet's start with a review of the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on U.S. tobacco consumers.\nIn January, the surge of Omicron cases disrupted consumers' routines and purchasing patterns, resulting in short-term decreases in retail trips and overall tobacco volumes.\nIncreased inflation throughout the quarter pressured discretionary income levels as the Consumer Price Index reached a 4-year high in March and higher gas prices were exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nHowever, the rise in inflation was partially offset by improved employment metrics and increased wage growth for some consumers. The unemployment rate was 3.6% at the end of March, down from 6% in March of 2021. Total wages grew by nearly 5% in the first quarter compared to 8% average inflation. For some occupations, wage growth outpaced inflation, including occupations that over-indexed toward tobacco consumers. For example, wages grew 11% for production-related jobs and nearly 10% for jobs pertaining to transportation and materials moving.\nAdditionally, the pressures of inflation were also offset for some consumers by higher federal income tax refunds. In the first quarter, the average federal income tax refund payment issued by the IRS increased by approximately 12%. We do expect inflation to persist for the balance of the year, however, and we will continue to monitor its effect on tobacco consumers.\nMoving to our consolidated results. Altria delivered strong first quarter performance in this dynamic environment, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 4.7%. Adjusted EPS growth was primarily driven by higher operating companies' income and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower adjusted earnings from our ABI investment.\nIn the smokeable products segment, we continued to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products. First quarter smokeable segment adjusted OCI increased 5.7% and Marlboro retail share was stable sequentially. We believe Marlboro's share performance through this period reflects its continued strong brand equity among smokers.\nWe believe the investments we have made behind data analytics and revenue growth management provide us with the right tools to support the smokeable strategies. These tools include PM USA's manufacturer-supported off-invoice program, which enables more efficient resource deployment for Marlboro, as well as retail trade programs with multiple options designed to provide retailers with store-level solutions for our brands. We believe these capabilities position our smokeable businesses to navigate the current environment and to continue to deliver strong profitability in support of our vision and shareholder returns.\nTurning to our smoke-free product portfolio. We're excited by the performance of on! and oral nicotine pouches. on! reported shipment volume nearly doubled to 18 million cans in the first quarter. At retail, on! share of all tobacco increased by 2.5 percentage points, reaching 4.1%. As we shared at CAGNY, on!'s share growth has been primarily driven by repeat purchases from existing on! consumers and increased tobacco consumer trial. We are encouraged that these dynamics continued into the first quarter.\nAt the category level, oral nicotine pouches reached a total oral tobacco retail share of 19.3 percentage points in the first quarter. The category grew 6.1 share points year-over-year, with on! representing more than 40% of this growth. We believe the brand continues to be a highly competitive product in the space, and it continues to perform well in all regions of the U.S.\nAs a reminder, our Premarket Tobacco Applications for the entire oral portfolio remain pending with the FDA. And we believe the FDA should determine that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health.\nWe are also actively working on Modified-Risk Tobacco Product applications for on! We believe MRTP claims will provide impactful points of differentiation for the brand and important tools in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products.\nIn e-vapor, we estimate that total category volume increased 10% versus the year-ago period and increased 4% sequentially as a result of increased volume in the vape store channel. Our minority investment in JUUL remains subject to challenge by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In February, an administrative law judge found in favor of Altria and JUUL and dismissed the entirety of the FTC's claims. The FTC is appealing that decision to the FTC. Any decision by the FTC is subject to appeal in federal appellate court.\nIn heated tobacco, our teams are continuing to work with PMI on IQOS reentry plans, and we will keep you informed on developments as circumstances warrant. There is no change to our expectations regarding IQOS product availability.\nMoving to the regulatory environment. President Biden signed a bill last month to bring synthetic nicotine products under FDA regulation by updating the definition of a tobacco product within the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include any product that contains nicotine, including synthetic nicotine products. The bill allows manufacturers of synthetic nicotine products currently on market to keep those products on the market for 120 days after the bill's enactment provided that they have submitted a PMTA for those products by May 14. Unless the FDA grants a PMTA within that time period, the products become unlawful and subject to the FDA's enforcement discretion.\nThe bill creates a certain exception for this review period for those circumstances where the FDA issued a denial of a marketing order and the manufacturer thereafter marketed the product with synthetic nicotine.\nWe believe this legislation is an important step toward the creation of a responsible, smoke-free marketplace consisting solely of FDA-authorized products.\nIn combustibles, the FDA has indicated that it is on track to issue proposed\nIn combustibles, the FDA has indicated that it is on track to issue proposed product standards this month regarding menthol and cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. As a reminder, the FDA rule-making process has multiple steps and provides several opportunities for stakeholders to provide input.\nUnderage smoking is at the lowest level in a generation, and efforts to prohibit the legal sale of products to adults, as we have seen with alcohol prohibition and cannabis criminalization, have consistently failed. Prohibition pushes products into illegal markets that lack regulatory oversight and lack underage prevention. We believe equitable harm reduction is a better public policy approach to reducing smoking and improving public health. This means manufacturers must develop and the FDA authorize an array of potentially reduced-harm alternatives that can appeal to and transition smokers across all backgrounds and demographic groups. We expect to be actively engaged in providing our perspective to the FDA throughout the process.\nWe remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the U.S. We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes. We're encouraged that the FDA has started authorizing smoke-free products. But more needs to be done to build a marketplace of authorized reduced-harm products that smokers can consider as they move away from cigarettes.\nOur tobacco businesses delivered extraordinary results in a challenging and dynamic environment, and this cannot be done without the passion, resiliency and fierce determination of our employees. Their talent and dedication continue to give me confidence in our ability to move beyond smoking.\nI'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Billy. I'd like to begin with a discussion on the inflationary environment, which was exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nWe continue to monitor the potential impacts to our operations and supply chain, and we are actively working to mitigate risk. Thanks to the hard work of our teams, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from these events. While our company will continue to monitor the situation, our hearts go out to the suffering Ukrainian people and to all of those affected by the war.\nMoving to our businesses. The smokeable products segment delivered excellent financial performance once again. In the first quarter, the segment grew its adjusted OCI by 5.7% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 59.5%. The segment also reported strong net price realization of 9.2%.\nFirst quarter smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 6.3%. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the first quarter declined by 8% and that industry volumes declined by 6.5% over the same period.\nWe believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one period can be influenced by various factors. In fact, the 2-year average decline rates for first quarter adjusted smokeable segment and industry cigarette volume declines were 5.5% and 4.5%, respectively.\nIn the marketplace, Marlboro demonstrated strength and resilience during a dynamic period for consumers. In the first quarter, Marlboro's retail share of the category was 42.6%, stable sequentially and down 0.4 versus the year ago period. Marlboro also maintained its leadership among premium brands, growing its share of the premium segment to 57.8%, up 0.2 sequentially and versus year ago.\nAnd in discount, total share of the cigarette category in the first quarter increased 0.3 sequentially to 26.4% driven primarily by deep-discount products. We believe the share increases in discount were due to the previously mentioned macroeconomic factors that affected tobacco consumers in the first quarter.\nIn cigars, Middleton continued to provide strong contributions to smokeable segment financial results, and we are encouraged by the continued strength of the iconic Black & Mild brand. Reported cigar shipment volume decreased 9.6% in the first quarter, primarily driven by trade inventory movements. To date, Middleton is successfully navigating the regulatory environment with the support of our regulatory affairs team, having received market orders or exemptions from the FDA covering over 99% of its volume.\nOf course, as Billy mentioned earlier, we will continue to monitor the FDA's proposed product standard on characterizing flavors in cigars and its potential impact to Middleton's portfolio. We expect to be actively engaged in providing our perspective throughout the rule-making process.\nMoving to the oral tobacco products segment, adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted in the first quarter primarily due to the increased investments behind on! Total segment reported shipment volume decreased 1.9%. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that total oral tobacco segment volumes were unchanged.\nAt the industry level, total oral tobacco volume growth moderated to 1.5% over the past 6 months. We continue to observe steady growth from the oral nicotine pouch category, but this has been offset by declining moist smokeless tobacco volumes as a result of difficult comparison periods and the macroeconomic challenges facing tobacco consumers.\nRetail share for the oral tobacco products segment declined 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter as declines in MST offset strong share gains for on!. We remain pleased with the overall performance of the segment as Copenhagen continues to generate significant income in the high-margin MST category, and we remain excited about the performance of on!\nTurning to our investment in ABI, we recorded $141 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter, down 25.8% versus the prior year. As we have previously shared, we view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders.\nMoving to capital allocation and our financial outlook. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares totaling $576 million. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the currently authorized $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by year-end.\nWe reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.79 to $4.93. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 4% to 7% from a $4.61 base in 2021. We continue to expect that 2022 adjusted diluted EPS growth will be weighted toward the second half of the year.\nBefore opening it up to Q&A, I'd like to comment on our recent ESG progress.\nWhilst harm reduction and underage use remain the most important social issues for our company to address, we have committed to make advancements in other ESG areas. At Altria, we are committed to reducing our environmental impact and recently announced our first virtual power purchase agreement for energy produced by a new wind farm project in Texas. This agreement marks significant progress toward 2 of our science-based environmental targets: Achieving 100% renewable electricity and reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030. When the project is operational, we expect we will hit both those targets ahead of schedule. We're proud to support a project that will bring additional renewable energy to the electricity grid, contributing to positive climate action.\nWith that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.\nLet's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mac Livingston, Vice President of Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMac Livingston\n\nVP of IR, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Leo. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Billy Gifford, Altria's CEO; and Sal Mancuso, our CFO, will discuss Altria's fourth quarter and full year business results. Earlier today, we issued a press release providing our results. The release, presentation, quarterly metrics and our latest corporate responsibility reports are all available at altria.com.\nDuring our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.\nFuture dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results.\nDescriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy.\n\nWilliam F. Gifford\n\nCEO & Director, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Altria delivered outstanding results in 2021 across our businesses, including strong financial performance, progress toward our vision and advancements in our ESG efforts. This morning, we'll highlight our accomplishments in each of these areas. First, Altria grew its 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5.7%, driven in part by the resiliency of our cigarette, cigar and moist smokeless tobacco businesses. Additionally, we returned more than $8.1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nThis total represents the third largest single year cash return in Altria's history and the largest annual return since 2002. We have continued to make progress toward our vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. Our teams took several steps forward in 2021, including accelerating the retail share growth of on! and further enhancing the capabilities to expand heated tobacco and other new U.S. tobacco products, advancing the science, research and development behind our smoke-free products, advocating for tobacco harm reduction by encouraging the FDA and other stakeholders to address the widely held nicotine misperceptions in society.\nAnd we made excellent strides in establishing a best-in-class consumer engagement system to support smoker transition to smoke-free products. Our system leverages robust transactional data and our advanced analytic capabilities to engage with consumers at the point of purchase. Finally, some of our achievements across our responsibility focus areas, included publishing 6 corporate responsibility reports, summarizing our progress in critical areas such as harm reduction and underage prevention and publishing our inaugural task force on climate-related financial disclosures report.\nWe were recognized for the second consecutive year with a AA rating from CDP for climate and water stewardship. And we advanced our internal talent and cultural goals, embraced workplace flexibility and embedded inclusion and diversity considerations within our performance review process to hold our leaders accountable. We're excited to share more about our responsibility efforts and our consumer engagement system next month at CAGNY. 2021 was a dynamic year for the U.S. tobacco industry, and total industry volumes were influenced by several factors, including pandemic-induced shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and tobacco usage occasions, a continued trend towards smoke-free alternatives and under evolving regulatory and legislative landscape.\nDespite year-over-year volatility due to pandemic-related factors, total tobacco volume trends remained stable. In fact, we estimate that overall tobacco space volumes have decreased by 0.3% annualized for the past 2 years and by 0.8% over the last 5 years on a compounded annual basis. Diving deeper, total estimated equivalized volumes for smoke-free products in the U.S. grew to 3.8 billion equivalized units in 2021 and represented approximately 24% of the total tobacco space.\nWe estimate the year-over-year increases in smoke-free volumes were driven by the e-vapor category, which resumed its growth after a temporary pause in 2020 and [oral] nicotine pouches, which continue to grow rapidly from a small base. 2021 smoke-free volumes also benefited from the geographic expansion of IQOS in the heated tobacco category. But we're pressured by modest declines in the MST category due to shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and movement to other smoke-free categories.\nAnd in combustibles, volume declined to approximately 11.8 billion equivalized units driven by several factors, which Sal will discuss later in his remarks. Turning to our smoke-free product portfolio. We're excited by the exceptional performance of on! and oral nicotine pouches. [on!] retail share of oral tobacco increased by nearly a full share point sequentially, reaching 3.9 share points for the fourth quarter and nearly doubling its share over the past 6 months. These strong results were primarily driven by an increase in (inaudible) purchases. As of the end of the year, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 in U.S. retail stores. The on! nicotine pouch category reached a total oral tobacco retail share of 17.9 percentage points in the fourth quarter, growing 7.4 share points year-over-year. We're encouraged that on! represented more than 1/3 of this growth and the brand is proving to be a highly competitive product in the space. Our premarket tobacco applications for the entire on! portfolio remain pending with the FDA. And we believe that the FDA should determine that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health. We are also working -- actively working on modified risk tobacco product applications for on! and expect to submit these applications to the FDA by the end of this year.\nWe believe an MRTP claim would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products. In heated tobacco, our teams made excellent progress with IQOS in the Northern Virginia market with Marlboro HeatSticks achieving a 1.9% retail share of the cigarette category in stores with distribution for the month of October. Unfortunately, PM USA had to remove IQOS from the market in November due to the International Trade Commission's importation ban and cease and desist orders.\nPMI is responsible for IQOS manufacturing, and we have been in contact regarding product availability. At the present time, we do not expect to have access to IQOS devices or Marlboro HeatSticks in 2022. However, we remain focused on returning IQOS to the market as soon as possible. Our teams are actively working on reentry plans and we expect to be ready to bring IQOS back to U.S. consumers when available. Our agreement with PMI contemplates disruptions such as those caused by the ITC orders and requires the parties to negotiate in good faith to amend the agreement appropriately.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we disclosed 2 milestones in our IQOS agreement with PMI necessary for PM USA to maintain its exclusive license and distribution rights for IQOS in the U.S. and to earn the renewal option for an additional 5-year term. The initial 5-year term does not expire until April of 2024. But we believe that PM USA has already met these milestones based on the strong performance of IQOS in the Charlotte and Northern Virginia markets. PMI has communicated that it [disagrees] with their position. We expect to continue discussing these matters with PMI. We firmly believe that heated tobacco products can play an important role in U.S. [harm reduction], and we are continuing our efforts to support the category's growth.\nWe have gained significant knowledge from our IQOS commercialization efforts, which we expect to use going forward. Our teams learned how to educate U.S. smokers on a brand-new tobacco category and how to effectively support their transition journey to smoke-free alternatives. We demonstrated improved performance in each successive market and gained valuable knowledge on leveraging MRTP claims to transition smokers. Additionally, we have built a robust post-market surveillance system, all of which we believe will position us to successfully achieve our objective of moving beyond smoking.\nMoving to the e-vapor category. The 2021 Monitoring the Future study was recently released, and the data showed positive improvements in underage usage trends. Both underage use of nicotine vaping products and JUUL specifically show continued signs of decline. The latest data shows that JUUL underage usage is down by 70% from 2019 with total underaged nicotine vaping down 27% over the same period. We are encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done, and we remain committed to continuing our work to reduce underage use of all tobacco products.\nTurning to the regulatory environment. The FDA is currently weighing several decisions that we believe will shape the future of harm reduction in the U.S. In the e-vapor category, the FDA has issued marketing denial orders for many e-vapor PMTAs, predominantly applications for open systems and flavored e-liquids. These denial orders have resulted in significant litigation across the country. In the meantime, PMTAs for most leading e-vapor products, including JUUL, are still an FDA review. The FDA granted its first e-vapor market order last year for the tobacco variant of a Cigalike product. The FDA has not reached a final decision for that manufacturer's (inaudible) variant but did deny its submissions for its other flavored cartridges.\nIn oral tobacco, PMTAs for the leading oral nicotine pouch products, including on! remain pending with the FDA. Last year, the FDA granted the first market authorizations among innovative oral tobacco products for our Verve discs and chews in the flavors of Green Mint and Blue Mint. These were also the first flavored product authorizations for newly deemed tobacco products. Additionally, MRTP applications previously submitted for Copenhagen Snuff and competitive snus products remain an FDA review.\nFinally, in combustibles, the FDA has stated that they are on track to issue a proposed product -- to issue proposed product standards by April 2022 and regarding menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. As a reminder, the FDA rule-making process for these and all potential product standards has multiple steps and provide several opportunities for stakeholders to provide input. There are formal requirements related to public notice and comment and steps requiring the office of management and budget to assess economic consequences at several points in the process.\nImportantly, if the FDA chooses to move forward with their final rules, they must address all comments received throughout the rule-making process. Of course, any final rule must take into account the potential for unintended consequences and would be subject to legal challenges. We plan to review the proposed rules in detail and intend to engage with the FDA and throughout the rulemaking process on each of these issues. We remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the U.S. We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation.\nWe are encouraged that the FDA has authorized a product in each of the 3 major smoke-free categories. Going forward, this year, we expect the FDA to carefully consider the scientific merits of each remaining application, and we're hopeful for significant progress in product marketing and claim authorizations. I would like to end my commentary regarding 2021 with the message to Altria's employees. Thank you for your dedication, passion and creativity through a difficult period. We experienced several challenges last year in both our professional and personal lives, and I admire your resiliency and fortitude. You are a driving force in moving beyond smoking and we are very appreciative of your efforts and commitment.\nLet's now move to our financial outlook for 2022. Our plans for the year ahead include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with investments toward our vision. For 2022, our planned investment areas include digital consumer engagement, smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparations and marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products.\nThe external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors such as the economy, including the impact of increased inflation; the impact of current and potential future COVID-19 variants and mitigation strategies; tobacco consumer dynamics, including tobacco usage occasions and available disposable income; and regulatory and legislative developments. Taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.79 to $4.93. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 4% to 7% from a [$4.61] base in 2021. We expect 2022 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Our guidance includes anticipated inflationary increases in master settlement agreement expenses and direct materials expenses and our current expectation that we will not have access to the IQOS system in 2022. I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results.\n\nSalvatore Mancuso\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Altria Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Billy. I'd like to begin with an update on consumer disposable income, mobility and retail store traffic. We believe rising gas prices, inflation and the reduction of COVID-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In addition, increased consumer mobility versus the prior year, offer consumers more options for their discretionary spending and led to fewer tobacco usage occasions.\nAt retail, fourth quarter trends were unchanged sequentially. We estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continue to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated.\nMoving to our businesses. The smokeable products segment delivered excellent financial performance once again. Our strategy for this segment continues to be maximizing profitability while balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. We believe our teams are successfully executing this strategy and the segment has delivered strong profit growth and stable Marlboro marketplace performance throughout the pandemic period. In the fourth quarter, the segment grew its adjusted OCI by 4.9% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 56.2%. The segment also reported strong net price realization of 8.8%.\nFourth quarter smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5.9%. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the fourth quarter declined by 8%, and that industry volumes declined by 6.5% over the same period. As a reminder, adjusted cigarette volumes were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020. With our smokeable segment adjusted cigarette volumes declining by just 1% and industry volumes growing by 1.5%.\nFor the full year, smokeable segment adjusted OCI grew 3.1% to $10.4 billion. Adjusted OCI margins expanded by 1.2 percentage points to 57.6%. These strong full year results were supported by robust net price realization up 9.1%. Full year smokable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 7.5% due to the strong comparison period and the continuation of pandemic-driven changes in the consumer behavior. When adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that smokable segment cigarette volumes declined by 6% and that the full industry declined by 5.5%.\nWe believe it's important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any 1 year can be influenced by various factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly been one of these distorting factors. And we believe the best way to assess cigarette volumes during this period is looking at 2020 and 2021 volumes combined. In fact, the 2-year average decline rates for adjusted smokable segment and industry cigarette volume declines were 4% and 3%, respectively, well within the range of historic norms.\nTurning to marketplace performance. Marlboro remains strong and has demonstrated resilience. The cigarette category remains very competitive. After market share gains in the first half of 2021, Marlboro did see share in the fourth quarter. We believe the sequential share decline occurred due to macroeconomic pressures on consumer disposable income. While the vast majority of Marlboro consumers are highly brand loyal, we do know that cigarette brand selection for a subset of smokers is dependent on economic conditions. These consumers are more likely to select premium brands during economic upswings as demonstrated by Marlboro share gains in the first half of 2021, but they are also more likely to trade down in tougher economic situations. We remain focused on the long-term strength of Marlboro. And we are very pleased that its full year share grew [0.2] to 43.1% and that the brand remained stable since the beginning of the pandemic.\nIn discount, total segment retail share in the fourth quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing (inaudible) sequentially to 26% driven primarily by deep discount products.\nWe believe the share increases observed in the discount segment or due to the previously mentioned macroeconomic factors that pressured the consumer in the fourth quarter. For the full year, discount segment share increased 0.5 to 25.4%, which was at the high end of its historical ranges. We expect fluctuation in discount segment shares to continue as the cohort of price-sensitive consumers react to their short-term economic conditions. And in cigars, Middleton provided strong contributions to smokable segment financial results.\nReported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged for the year, as Middleton maintained the strength of the iconic Black & Mild brand and successfully managed the supply chain during a challenging year. Turning to the oral tobacco products segment, adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted for the full year, primarily due to increased investments behind on!. Total segment reported shipment volume was unchanged for the year. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, we estimate that total oral tobacco segment volumes declined by 0.5%.\nWe remain pleased with the overall performance of the segment as Copenhagen continues to generate significant income in the high-margin MST category, and we're excited about the growth demonstrated by on!. Oral Tobacco Products segment retail share for the fourth quarter was down slightly sequentially as strong share gains from on! nearly offset declines in MST. The segment declined 1.6 percentage points versus the fourth quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category.\nTurning to our investment in ABI. We recorded $172 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing Altria's share of ABI's third quarter results. For the full year, we recorded $639 million in adjusted equity earnings, up 18.3% versus 2020. As we shared in our previous earnings call, we view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. In our all Other operating category, we continue to make progress on our wind down of Philip Morris Capital Corporation. At year-end, the net finance assets balance was $114 million, down more than $200 million since the end of 2020 due to rents received and asset sales.\nAs previously announced, we expect to complete the PMCC wind down by the end of 2022. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns. As Billy mentioned in his opening remarks, we returned more than $8.1 billion in cash last year to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These record cash returns included paying $6.4 billion in dividends, raising the dividend for the 56th time in [50] years and repurchasing nearly 36 million shares during the year totaling $1.7 billion.\nWe also sold St. Michelle Wine Estates and expanded our share repurchase program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion. We have approximately $1.8 billion remaining under this expanded program, which we expect to complete by December 31, 2022. We continue to have a strong balance sheet, and our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. As of year-end, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3x and our weighted average coupon was 4%.\nWith that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?",

Thank you for joining us, and welcome to the Cboe Global Markets Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to Ken Hill, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call.\nOn the call today, Craig Donohue, our CEO, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Jill Griebenow, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as discuss our 2025 financial outlook.\nFollowing their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be Chris Isaacson, our Chief Operating Officer; Prashant Bhatia, our Head of Enterprise Strategy and Corporate Development; and Rob Hocking, our Global Head of Derivatives.\nI would like to point out this presentation will include the use of slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of the website.\nDuring our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.\nPlease refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.\nDuring the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Craig.\n\nCraig Steven Donohue\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CME Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results.\nOur performance this quarter underscores how Cboe is operating from a position of strength a result of our world-class products, platforms and people. We're building on that momentum and sharpening our strategic focus designed to unlock even greater value and opportunities for growth. Following the conclusion of a rigorous review of our businesses, we will initiate a sales process for our Cboe Australia and Cboe Canada businesses. We will discontinue our U.S. and European corporate listings efforts, and we will reduce our costs related to our U.S. and European ETP listings businesses, Cboe Europe Derivatives Exchange and several of our smaller risk and market analytics businesses. This strategic realignment ensures Cboe is well positioned in a dynamic and evolving market and strengthens our long-term vision to be a global derivatives leader. These changes will be accretive to earnings and Jill will discuss in her prepared remarks how these actions strengthen our financial position and unlock new growth opportunities.\nI'd like to express our deep appreciation to all our team members for their dedication and hard work and supporting each of these businesses.\nWhile our Australian and Canadian equities businesses are performing well, we've determined that they fall outside of our core focus and strategy. We are grateful to our regulators in Australia and Canada for the support and collaboration they have shown us, and we will work closely with them to ensure a smooth transition for all of our key stakeholders.\nWith this renewed focus, we are directing greater attention to our core businesses, which are operating from a position of strength. We see tremendous opportunities across index and multi-list options, Futures, U.S. and European equities and FX inclusive of Data Vantage. Leveraging these core areas of strength for Cboe and the strong secular growth trends supporting them, we believe we are well positioned to fully capture their growth and earnings potential as we strengthen our competitive positioning.\nTurning now to the third quarter. Cboe grew net revenue 14% year-over-year to a record $605.5 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased a robust 20% to a record $2.67. These results were again driven by strong volumes in both our multi-list and proprietary index option products solid new sales growth in our Cboe Data Vantage business, robust industry volumes in our Cash and Spot Markets and continued strong expense discipline. Most importantly, our performance once again underscore the durability of our net revenue generation with strength evident across nearly every segment of our business. In fact, in the third quarter, all 3 of our revenue categories, Derivatives Markets, Cash and Spot Markets and Data Vantage posted double-digit net revenue growth.\nAs we head into the final months of the year, we look forward to building on those broad-based trends. Taking a closer look at the third quarter trends by category, our derivatives franchise delivered another record quarter with net revenue increasing 15% year-over-year. In our multi-list options business, net transaction and clearing fees revenue was up a solid 14% and given higher industry volumes and positive market share trends. While the multi-list option space remains highly competitive, Cboe is well positioned to benefit from strong secular trends, having taken meaningful steps to deepen our talent pool in the options space, while actively pursuing thoughtful regulatory reforms that support both the industry and investors.\nOn the index options side, net transaction and clearing fees revenue was up a strong 19% as our proprietary SPX options complex set new records powered by robust growth in 0DTE options trading. SPX 0DTE average daily volume surged 62% year-over-year while overall SPX ADV increased 26% to a record 3.9 million contracts. 0DTE options made up over 61% of SPX volumes, up from a 48% share a year ago. We saw a similar dynamic in many SPX options where 0DTE ADV more than doubled over the past year and drove an impressive 66% increase in total ADV during the quarter. 0DTE options now make up roughly half of many SPX volume, up from 35% a year ago.\nIn our Proprietary Options business, it's noteworthy that 9 of the 10 highest average daily volume months occurred in 2025, with September ranking as the third highest month on record only behind March and October month-to-date activity. In fact, our largest SPX day on record occurred on October 10 with 6.4 million SPX contracts traded and a record 33.2 million total options contracts traded across our index and multi-list products. It's also worth noting that growth in our 0DTE options franchise reflects not only wider adoption and broader access, but it's also a result of Cboe's distinct advantages in product innovation contract design and market structure. We look forward to leaning into these advantages with our new MAG 10 Index options and futures launch subject to regulatory approval, giving investors a simpler way to gain exposure to the AI and tech being and a more precise way to manage risk using cash-settled European style options.\nWhile SPX volumes in the third quarter were robust, our VIX products face a more stable macro backdrop and lower realized volatility. The continued growth in our index options despite the lower activity in our VIX complex highlights the strength and versatility of Cboe's comprehensive volatility toolkit.\nLooking ahead, we remain positive on the outlook for our core derivatives business. With trade tensions, a government shutdown and more uncertain economic outlook, we see investors continuing to utilize options to manage risk. Secular trends of increasing retail participation and international expansion should provide further tailwinds. We continue to onboard more international brokers as global customers seek exposure to U.S. financial markets.\nMoving to Cash and Spot Markets. Net revenue was up a strong 14% as our European cash equities business continued to drive robust performance for the category, led by another quarter of strength in our European transaction businesses, the Europe and Asia Pacific segment delivered the strongest year-over-year net revenue percentage growth of any Cboe segment for the fifth quarter in a row, achieving an impressive 24% increase. This was driven by a 35% year-over-year growth in net transaction and clearing fees resulting from strong industry volumes, solid market share gains and a higher net capture. Global FX also made another solid contribution, growing net revenue 13% year-over-year in Q3. Over a longer time horizon, FX delivered quarterly year-over-year net revenue growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters, speaking to the durability of this segment's revenue generation.\nTurning to Data Vantage. Net revenue increased by 12% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued momentum across our platform. Notably, nearly 90% of the growth across our market data and access businesses was driven by new unit and new sales as opposed to pricing. This growth speaks to the sizable demand for Cboe's data and access products, including our newer offerings, decaded cores and time damping.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jill to walk through the details of our financials and guidance for the quarter.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Craig.\nCboe posted another strong quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of 20% on a year-over-year basis to $2.67. I will provide some high-level takeaways from this quarter's operating results before going through segment results.\nNet revenue increased 14% versus the third quarter of 2024 to finish at a record $605.5 million with each of our categories producing healthy year-over-year growth. Specifically, Derivatives Markets net revenues grew 15%. Data Vantage net revenues grew 12% and cash and spot markets net revenues grew 14%. Adjusted operating expenses of $210 million were up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA of $409 million grew 21% and adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded by 3.8 percentage points to 67.5% versus the third quarter of 2024, demonstrating both our strong business performance and disciplined expense management.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments, so I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe Options segment delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record net revenue with 19% year-over-year growth. Cboe total options ADV was up 26% with a 15% increase in index options volume and a 31% increase in multi-listed options volume. North American Equities net revenue increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. Access and capacity fees increased 10% as compared to the third quarter of 2024. And stronger industry volumes helped temper softer net capture and market share in our transaction net revenues. Europe and APAC produced 24% year-over-year net revenue growth, reflecting another quarter of strong growth in Europe. Net transaction and clearing fees for the segment were up 35%, while non-transaction revenues were up a combined 14%. Futures net revenue decreased 22% from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower volume. And finally, Global FX net revenue was up 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 3% increase in average daily notional value and a 9% increase in net capture.\nLooking at our CBO Data Vantage business, net revenues were up 12% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Building on the solid year-to-date trends, revenue growth was again driven by strong new subscription and unit sales. New sales represented nearly 90% of Market Data and Access Solutions revenue growth in the quarter, with the remainder coming from pricing changes. As Craig discussed, we are encouraged by the sales momentum occurring across our new product offerings.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were $210 million for the quarter and up 3% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense as a result of our strong revenue trends, which have increased our bonus incentive accrual.\nBefore moving to our 2025 guidance update, I would like to discuss the anticipated financial impact of the business decisions announced earlier this morning. While we are still working through these changes with our key stakeholders, we do not anticipate that these actions will have a material impact on our 2025 total organic net revenue growth or our 2025 adjusted operating expenses, and they are fully captured in our updated guidance. On a go-forward basis, we expect the annualized run rate impact of both today's announcements and the completed wind down of our Japanese equities business to be accretive to our earnings, resulting in roughly a 3% reduction in net revenue and an 8% to 10% erection in adjusted operating expenses using the 2025 guided ranges of the baseline. That being said, realizing the full impact of the actions will take time as we work through the various realignment actions and sales processes. We will look to provide a more fulsome progress update to help calibrate the timing of various impacts when we announced our 2026 guidance during fourth quarter earnings in February.\nMoving to our full year 2025 guidance. We are increasing our full year total organic net revenue growth guidance range to low double-digit to mid-teens from high single digit given our strong year-to-date results and fourth quarter trends. We are increasing our Data Vantage organic net revenue growth range to high single digit to low double digit from mid- to high single digit, following stronger-than-expected year-to-date growth. We are lowering our full year adjusted operating expense guidance range to $827 million to $842 million from $832 million to $847 million. This decrease reflects our year-to-date operating discipline as well as reduced expectations for depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by higher incentive compensation given our healthy revenue generation. We are lowering our full year guidance range for CapEx to $73 million to $83 million from $75 million to $85 million, and we are also lowering our expectation for depreciation and amortization to $50 million to $54 million from $53 million to $57 million. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for the full year. And while we don't provide formal guidance on interest income or interest expense, we expect that interest expense, net of interest income, will be approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter.\nOn the capital front, our adjusted cash position of $1.5 billion and leverage ratio of 1.0x demonstrate our healthy balance sheet. In addition, Moody's recently upgraded our credit rating by 1 notch to A2, reflecting the strength of our financial profile.\nIn the third quarter, we returned $76 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.72 dividend, representing a 14% year-over-year increase in our quarterly dividend.\nTurning to our investment in the Seven Ridge Fund holding trading technologies. The transaction detailed in last quarter's earnings call is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 and subject to regulatory approval. As of September 30, 2025, the carrying value of the investment reflects assumptions, including the agreed sales price related to the estimated fair value of trading technologies. A gain of $45.6 million is included in our earnings on investments for the third quarter, but the impact has been adjusted out of our non-GAAP income statement.\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate recognizing an incremental gain upon the final closure of the transaction. Similar to the third quarter, we will adjust the gain out of our non-GAAP income statement.\nAs an organization, we are focused on optimizing capital deployment to strike the right balance between margin efficiency and investment in emerging growth trends following our review. And while the decision process to strategically realign our business portfolio is complete, our commitment to continuously assessing new opportunities and optimizing our businesses will be unwavering. We will maintain a disciplined approach to assessing all aspects of our business with a clear emphasis on driving revenue growth and enhancing profitability to maximize shareholder returns.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Craig for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nCraig Steven Donohue\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CME Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jill.\nAs Jill highlighted, our business is operating from a position of exceptional strength, and we now have a clear path to unlock even greater value. The strategic realignment of our business portfolio and human capital allows us to focus on optimizing our core businesses for further growth and profitability and pursue opportunities in emerging growth areas. While we continue to undergo change, our continued success makes us a destination for talent. The realignment and focus on growth allows us to continue to build senior leadership talent across the organization. In the past 6 months, we have made key hires in Strategy and Corporate Development, Global Derivatives, Clearing and Data Vantage. And yesterday, we announced another key hire as we welcome JJ Kinahan as Head of Retail Expansion and alternative investment products. JJ is a well-regarded industry veteran and the retail brokerage space with deep expertise in equity derivatives markets. He brings a wealth of experience to the Cboe management team, and I look forward to working closely with him and Rob as we pursue new growth opportunities in the retail-oriented digital crypto and event contract space.\nWe have made meaningful progress over the last 6 months, and we have a great deal more to do. I am energized by the momentum of the organization and excited to channel what we've learned into driving transformative change.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ken for Q&A.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\n[Operator Instructions]"

My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cboe Global Markets Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ken Hill, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Craig Donohue, our CEO, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Dave Howson, our Global President, will provide some comments as he hands his responsibilities to Chris Isaacson, our Chief Operating Officer; and Cathy Clay, our Global Head of Derivatives, who will join us for Q&A.

During the earnings call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Craig.\n\nCraig Steven Donohue\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CME Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Having assumed the CEO role in early May, I have been impressed by the outstanding results Cboe delivered while navigating an evolving macro landscape as well as a variety of corporate developments.\nDuring the second quarter, Cboe grew net revenue 14% year-over-year to a record $587 million and adjusted diluted EPS and by 14% to $2.46. These results were again driven by robust volumes across our derivatives franchise both in multi-list and proprietary index option products, strong new sales growth in our Cboe Data Vantage business, resilient industry volumes in our cash and spot markets and disciplined expense management.\nBuilding on a theme we've seen gain traction in recent quarters, the second quarter strength was broad-based. All 3 categories, Derivative Markets, Cash and Spot Markets and Data Vantage produced double-digit net revenue growth on a year-over-year basis contributing to record first half results for the firm.\nTaking a closer look at the second quarter trends, our Derivatives franchise delivered a record quarter with organic net revenue increasing 17% year-over-year. Options volumes increased on the back of heightened market volatility as investors used options to help manage risk in a quarter marked by both sharp sell-off and even sharper rebounds.\nIn our multi-list options business, net transaction and clearing fees revenue was up a robust 32% given higher industry volumes and positive pricing trends.\nIn our proprietary products, SPX options volumes jumped 21% year-over-year to a new record average daily volume of 3.7 million contracts, while many SPX options average daily volume rose 50% to a record 108,000 contracts. Even more importantly, the second quarter demonstrated the full utility of our S&P 500 volatility toolkit as well as the resilience of our diverse customer base.\nAs volatility surged in April, traders gravitated to our established SPX and VIX contracts for liquidity and market depth with SPX options setting a single-day record of 6 million contracts on April 4. Much of the increase in April came from institutional investors using index options to hedge particularly longer-dated options, which saw the biggest increase relative to other tenors.\nWhile institutional activity was robust in April, retail traders pulled back as evidenced by decreasing share of 0DTE volume in April. While retail investors tend to step back when volatility jumps unexpectedly as it did in April, they typically reengage once volatility moderates, which is what we observed in May and June.\nSPX 0DTE volumes rebounded to new highs ending June with a new record monthly ADV of 2.2 million contracts. We've highlighted the resilience of SPX 0DTE trading in the past and it's encouraging to see it reaffirmed once again last quarter. In the past year alone, we've seen the VIX Index hit a high of 60 twice and SPX intraday volatility jump to a post global financial crisis high.\nThrough it all, SPX 0DTE options have continued to grow propelled by wider adoption and new use cases. In Q2, they made up a record 57% of overall SPX options volume. Looking ahead, we remain positive about the growth potential of options as an asset class and our proprietary index options franchise. Continued uncertainty regarding monetary and trade policy is expected to support the continued use of options to dynamically manage risk.\nStructural factors such as increasing retail participation and international expansion should provide further tailwinds. Anecdotally, we see encouraging signs from international brokers. They continue to expand access by extending trading hours and by increasing functionality for complex and simple orders across Cboe's proprietary index product set and a greater number of symbols. These efforts are well aligned with Cboe's initiatives to deliver education and local market intelligence to a global audience.\nMoving to Cash and Spot Markets. Second quarter net revenue was up a strong 11% as our European cash equities business continued to drive robust performance for the category. Led by the strength in Europe, our Europe and Asia Pacific segment delivered the strongest year-over-year percentage growth of any Cboe segment for the fourth quarter in a row achieving an impressive 30% increase.\nThe increase was driven by a 39% year-over-year growth in net transaction and clearing fees, resulting from strong industry volumes and solid market share gains in Europe across our portfolio of products. Higher nontransaction revenues in the segment also contributed to the growth with revenue up 21% year-over-year.\nIn other areas of global equities, last week, we announced the decision subject to consultation with regulators to close our Japan equities business on August 29. This will include the Cboe Japan proprietary trading system and Cboe BID Japan business. This decision reflects our philosophy of directing resources to the highest potential return activities across our organization, specifically exiting the equities business and redeploying time, energy and investment dollars to supporting Japanese customers through our derivatives and market data capabilities.\nWe continue to see great demand from Japanese market participants for access to international markets, U.S. and European market data and our global derivative products. To support these efforts, Cboe will maintain a presence in Japan focused on sales and client engagement.\nTurning to our Data Vantage business. Net revenue for the category improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis. During the second quarter, we saw a positive contribution from all 3 major components of Data Vantage with subscription-based data, analytics and index products producing strong year-over-year gains.\nLooking more closely at the second quarter dynamics, international demand remains a key driver of new data sales with roughly 45% occurring outside the U.S. in the second quarter. We are looking to accelerate that growth with new hires to lead our market data sales as well as our analytics and indices businesses in the Asia Pacific region.\nBeyond strengthening our sales capabilities we're leveraging new technologies and developing new products to enhance our offerings. We're accelerating the migration of our Derivatives data to the cloud and actively exploring new global access points where we see growing demand.\nOn the product front, we're leaning into the secular trend in derivatives-based ETFs while leveraging our expertise to create indices and partnership with our index providers and issuers. On access, our dedicated cores offering, which provides superior performance and determinism continued to perform well as we see the benefits of reallocating resources to revenue-enhancing activities.\nThe interconnectedness and importance of the Data Vantage business at Cboe should not be understated. Each enhancement to our market access layer, subscription-based data sales and even real-time values from the index business, provide an ecosystem benefit to Cboe in the form of better customer engagement and improved activity levels for our trading businesses.\nBefore I conclude this portion of my remarks, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank Dave Howson for his contributions during his time here at Cboe. While we'll miss Dave, I also could not be more pleased to elevate Chris and Cathy, both of whom are strong and proven leaders here at Cboe.\nCboe is on solid footing, and we are well positioned to deliver on the opportunities ahead. And now I'll turn the call over to Dave to say a few words.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & President of Europe, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Craig. I just wanted to briefly take the opportunity to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues here at Cboe and our customers that have taught me so much over the years. I am proud to have been part of such transformational change over the last 12 years as part of the Cboe and [ Bats ] management team, and in particular, the last 3 years as President.\nOver which time we've expanded our global presence through establishing a [ One ] Cboe mindset. The firm success has been a collective achievement as we've managed through a tremendous amount of change while laying the foundation for future success. I am grateful to be able to hand things off to such capable leaders in Chris and Cathy as I return home to be closer to my family.\nI have known Chris and Cathy for 12 and 8 years, respectively. They are not only both long-time close partners but seasoned leaders and respected market practitioners with a track record of driving innovation in the industry.\nAnd before I hand it over to Jill for the financial update, I want to say a heartfelt thank you to the analyst and investor community. I have enjoyed engaging with you all on earnings calls and numerous conferences over the years and will truly miss our interactions. Now I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. Cboe posted another strong quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 14% on a year-over-year basis to $2.46. I will provide some high-level takeaways from this quarter's operating results before going through segment results.\nNet revenue increased 14% versus the second quarter of 2024 to finish at a record $587 million with each of our categories producing healthy year-over-year growth. Specifically, Derivatives Markets net revenues grew 17%. Data Vantage net revenues grew 11% and Cash and Spot Markets net revenues grew 11%.\nAdjusted operating expenses of $213 million were up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA of $387 million grew 19% and adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded by 2.3 percentage points to 65.8% versus the second quarter of 2024, reflecting strong performance across our businesses as well as disciplined expense management.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments, so I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe Options segment delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record net revenue, with 19% year-over-year growth. Total options ADV was up 20%, with a 17% increase in index options volume and a 22% increase in multi-listed options volume. North American Equities net revenue was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis.\nAccess and capacity fees increased 16% as compared to the second quarter of 2024, and industry volumes supported the transaction side of the businesses. Europe and APAC produced another quarter of record net revenue with a 30% year-over-year increase, reflecting particularly strong growth in Europe. Net transaction and clearing fees for the segment were up 39%, while nontransaction revenues were up a combined 21%.\nFutures net revenue decreased 14% from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower volumes. And finally, our global FX segment also achieved another quarter of record net revenue, with 19% year-over-year growth, driven by a 17% increase in average daily notional value.\nLooking at our Cboe Data Vantage business. Net revenues were up 11% on an organic basis in the second quarter. Net revenue growth continued to be led by strong new subscription and unit sales which accounted for roughly 3/4 of the total net revenue growth for the quarter. The remaining growth was attributable to pricing changes, which continue to play a more modest role in our Data Vantage growth strategy.\nAs Craig mentioned, we remain focused on scaling our product set by leveraging our advanced technology and differentiated product offerings. We believe these additions, combined with ongoing brand investments and a sharpened focus on sales outcomes, position Data Vantage for sustained long-term growth.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were $213 million for the quarter and up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization and technology support services expenses were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in travel and promotional as well as professional fees and outside services expenses.\nMoving to our 2025 guidance. We are lowering our full year expense guidance range to $832 million to $847 million from $837 million to $852 million. This decrease reflects our year-to-date operating discipline and the impact from our decision to close our Japanese equities business, partially offset by higher incentive compensation.\nRegarding the wind-down of our Japanese equities business, we expect to record an estimated pretax charge of approximately $5 million in the third quarter of 2025, primarily related to noncash impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and technology-related software. This charge is expected to be excluded from adjusted operating expenses.\nFrom an expense savings perspective, we expect the impact on adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million in 2025. Going forward, savings are expected to be in the $10 million to $12 million range on a normalized annual basis.\nPartially offsetting some of the lower expense components mentioned, our updated guidance also factors in a higher bonus accrual given both our strong year-to-date revenue trends as well as our healthy expectations for the second half of the year. In addition, we anticipate some reacceleration in marketing spend throughout the remainder of 2025. Overall, we believe our expense guidance range provides flexibility to invest in the business while also positioning us to deliver on our shareholder return objectives.\nLooking at our full year guidance more broadly, we are increasing our full year total organic net revenue growth guidance range to high single digits from mid- to high single digits given our strong first half results. We are reaffirming our Data Vantage organic net revenue growth range of mid- to high single digits, following solid year-to-date trends and a steady outlook for the second half of 2025.\nOur full year guidance range for CapEx remains at $75 million to $85 million, and we are lowering our expectation for depreciation and amortization to $53 million to $57 million, from $55 million to $59 million range. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for the full year.\nAnd while we don't provide formal guidance on interest income or interest expense, we expect that interest expense net of interest income, will be approximately $1 million in the third quarter of 2025.\nOn the capital front, we remain pleased with the health of our financial position, exemplified by the $1.2 billion of adjusted cash on our balance sheet, an attractive debt profile and a leverage ratio of 1.0x.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $35 million in shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $65 million. Alongside our share repurchase activity, we returned $66 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.63 dividend during the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain focused on effectively allocating capital while leveraging our flexible balance sheet and free cash flow profile to produce sustainable shareholder value.\nLastly, I want to provide an update on our investment in the 7RIDGE funds holding trading technologies. This week, Trading Technologies announced an investment transaction that is expected to result in Cboe fully exiting its investment in the 7RIDGE fund that currently owns trading technologies. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025 after regulatory clearance. Cboe expects the transaction to result in the gain recorded against the June 30, 2025 tiering value of its investment in the 7RIDGE fund.\nWhile I cannot provide any incremental details around the potential gain until the transaction is complete, I will note that consistent with our historical treatment of minority investment gains and losses at sales, we anticipate adjusting out any future impact incurred with the exit of this investment from our non-GAAP metrics. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Craig for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nCraig Steven Donohue\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, CME Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jill. While I have only been in the CEO role at Cboe for a few months, I wanted to leave you with some of my early impressions of the company and what you can expect from me and our senior leadership team moving forward.\nFirst, I have been impressed by the power of Cboe's suite of cash, data and derivatives products, our global presence and our market-leading technology, all underpinned by a highly capable management team and associate base. As reflected in today's results our portfolio of businesses is performing at a very high level.\nAt the same time, with the continued guidance and support of our Board, we are an organization that remains committed to improving, adapting and positioning ourselves to deliver more value to shareholders over time. This not only means exploring organic and inorganic investment opportunities around key capabilities but optimizing the growth and profitability in our core businesses.\nWe are committed to bringing a rigorous financial discipline to how we allocate capital, both dollars and people across the firm. Our decision to close our Japanese equities business was representative of that thought process in action.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to continually assessing our business portfolio to produce the best long-term returns for shareholders. As I mentioned, clearly, several areas at Cboe are performing exceptionally well from cash to data to derivatives. The second quarter was an outstanding one and the record first half results showcase the power of the business.\nHeading into the second half of the year, I am energized by the opportunities ahead. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ken for questions and answers.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cboe Global Markets First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ken Hill, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Fred Tomczyk, our CEO; and Dave Howson, our Global President, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then Jill Griebenow, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as discuss our 2025 financial outlook. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be Chris Isaacson, our Chief Operating Officer.\nI'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nDuring our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.\nDuring the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Fred.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our results, I want to express my support for the announced appointment of Craig Donohue, as Cboe's new CEO. Craig is a seasoned visionary leader who brings a wealth of experience to the role and is deeply respected across the industry. The Board believes he is the right leader to take Cboe into the future. I'll share more about the planned transition a little later in the call, but let me first recap our strong results.\nDuring the first quarter, Cboe grew net revenue 13% year-over-year to a record $565 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by 16% to a record $2.50. These results were driven by strong volumes across our derivatives franchise both in multi-list and our proprietary index option products, strong performance in our cash and spot markets, continued global expansion of our data vantage business and disciplined expense management. While the robust option volumes were especially notable for the quarter, the broad-based results across each category, derivative markets, cash and spot markets and data advantage were strong and contributed to the record quarterly growth.\nOur Derivatives business delivered a record quarter with organic net revenue increasing 16% year-over-year as traders and investors utilize our flagship VIX and S&P 500 index option products across an ever-changing market environment, helping to respond to geopolitical events, market volatility and the macroeconomic uncertainty around the globe. We saw strong volumes across our suite of index option products with first quarter ADV in the SPX contract, increasing 13% year-over-year. And ADV in the XSP contract increasing 61% year-over-year. We also saw solid performance in our volatility product suite during the first quarter with fixed options ADV increasing 33% and VIX futures ADV increasing 13%.\nVolumes across our index and multi-list products remained elevated in April, as the tariff announcements created significant volatility and uncertainty in global markets, fueling a robust start to the second quarter. Given the secular and cyclical tailwinds in place, we are well positioned as investors continue to utilize options in their portfolio and trading strategies.\nOur Data Vantage business performed well during the quarter, with organic net revenue increasing 8% year-over-year. We continue to see durability in this business as we leverage our global network and ecosystem of data and access solutions to drive growth.\nOur Cash and Spot markets also performed well during the quarter as organic net revenue increased 10%, driven by healthy trading volumes and growth across all of our regional equities markets.\nOverall, it was an excellent quarter for both transaction and non-transaction revenue growth to start the year. Looking forward, we remain laser-focused on executing our longer-term strategy including investing in the continued growth of our core business, global derivatives, increasing recurring revenue opportunities through Data Advantage, harnessing the power of our global network and client base to expand product reach and access, capitalizing on the demand for access to the U.S. capital market, leveraging our superior technology to help drive innovation and product development and disciplined allocation of resources and capital towards the long-term secular growth trends.\nAs witnessed during the first quarter, our strategic focus is well aligned to the secular trends we see in the capital markets and leverages our core strengths. We see significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific region where we see growing demand for our index option products, which serve as an efficient and accessible way to gain exposure to the U.S. market.\nWe see a solid pipeline of clients in the region, and during the first quarter we onboarded new clients in Korea and Taiwan to offer our proprietary products. We see this as a long-term secular growth trend, and we are excited about the early signs of growth and penetration in this market.\nTurning to our Data Vantage business. Our global footprint continued to help drive results during the quarter. Leveraging Cboe Data Vantage products will be key to helping our Asia Pacific customers, gain the access they need to U.S. markets, and we're working diligently to make that more seamless and accessible. And more recently, we've also seen increased interest for European market data amongst our Asia Pacific customers, reinforcing the power of our global network to provide our customer base with the data and access they need across global markets.\nAdditionally, we remain focused on product innovation across our ecosystem and unlocking access to U.S. markets for international investors. Whether it be through increased accessibility, new products or education will continue to help people access the liquidity and efficiency of the U.S. markets while also providing trusted markets in local regions around the world.\nTo that end, in the first quarter, we completed our final equities exchange migration to Cboe Titanium, our best-in-class exchange technology platform. During the recent market turbulence, our exchanges have demonstrated remarkable resilience and reliability which is critical to our customers. We will continue to invest in our exchange technology platform to help ensure we have durable technology powering our markets and driving innovation for our customers.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave to talk in more detail about the business line results.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. Starting with our Derivatives business. Net revenues increased a robust 16% to a record $309 million in the first quarter. We saw activity accelerate throughout the period to produce record total options average daily volumes across our 4 options exchanges. Notably, we reached all-time quarterly, monthly and single day highs in SPX during the first quarter. XSP, our Mini-SPX product reached a new quarterly record at overall proprietary index options ADV achieved all-time quarterly and monthly highs.\nLooking a little deeper into the drivers of the record activity auction volumes surged on the back of heightened geopolitical volatility as investors turn to options to help navigate the increasingly uncertain macro outlook. SPX options volume increased 13% year-over-year to a record ADV of 3.6 million contract, while VIX auction volumes jumped to almost 33% to an ADV of 948,000 contracts.\nThe growth in our SPX options franchise was led by a continued rise in 0 DTE options trading. This was on the back of 2 factors. First was the fast-moving nature of headlines coming from this administration as investors turn to 0-day options to help monetize the increase in intraday volatility. Second was expanded access with Robinhood rolling out index options to all its customers in late January. Zero DTE auction volumes averaged almost 2 million contracts in Q1, up 29% year-over-year and making up a record 55% share of overall SPX volume. In this headline-driven market, the ability to trade in and out of risk at all hours of the day became ever more important, especially as we expand our customer base internationally. Index option volume in our global trading hours hit a record last quarter, up 36% year-over-year. Over 253,000 SPX options traded during overnight hours on January 27, when the deep sea headlines hit the market more than during the November U.S. election. That record has since been broken multiple times in April as trade tensions escalated.\nOutside of our established SPX and VIX franchise, we're also seeing encouraging growth in several new products. Most notably, our new Bitcoin index options, tickers, CEDX and MBTX since the December launch. ETF issuers, in particular, have gravitated toward our products by introducing options-based strategies on Bitcoin. Already, 15 ETFs are using CEDX and [ NBTX ] options in their strategies with more expected to come. [ NBTX ] options volumes hit a record high of over 27,000 contracts on March 31, equivalent to $527 million in notional. We're excited to expand on our Bitcoin offering with Cboe FTSE Bitcoin index futures, which launched on April 28.\nBesides crypto, we also saw a healthy uptick in our corporate bond futures. Open interest in our high-yield futures recently hit a record high of $901 million in notional value while open interest in our investment-grade futures jumped to $547 million. As credit market volatility picks up, we expect continued growth and adoption in these products. The breadth and strength of the Cboe [indiscernible] was on full display to start the year, be it early in the quarter as investors made tactical shifts with the use of 0 DTE SPX options or navigated more outsized volatility events with Cboe's VIX options and futures.\nAs we head into the second quarter, volatility has remained elevated with trade tensions, recession risk and potential inflation shocks. The need for both retail and institutional investors to use options to dynamically manage positions, hedge exposures and generate income only increases.\nAlready in the second quarter, we've seen SPX volumes hit an all-time high of 6 million contracts on April 4, with quarter-to-date proprietary product ADV running above previous quarterly and annual records.\nMoving to Cash and Spot markets. First quarter revenue was up 10% as each region contributed to the upside. With Cboe Canada successfully migrating to Cboe Titanium during the quarter we now have all our equities and derivatives markets across North America, U.K., Europe, Australia and Japan, running on Cboe Titanium. The resiliency of the platform has been on full display in 2025 as we have seen record volumes and activity in many of our markets.\nFor context, on April 7, we seamlessly processed over 1 trillion orders and market data events across our 27 global markets. In today's environment, having a globally consistent locally optimized technology platform is a differentiated strength that will help Cboe to expand access to its market, data, products and services to customers around the world.\nIn North American equities, net revenue was up 2% as increased non-transaction revenue was partially offset by lower net transaction and clearing fees versus the first quarter of 2024. In the U.S., industry activity levels have been healthy, but the benefit was muted by a smaller addressable market for Cboe with total volume transacted off exchange or during auctions hitting 56% for the first quarter or 6 percentage points higher than Q1 2024 levels. On the nontransaction side, we have seen durable demand for our access services and data products.\nOur Europe and Asia Pacific segment delivered the strongest year-over-year percentage growth of any segment for the third quarter in a row, printing an impressive 18% increase or 22% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by higher net transaction and clearing fees, up 30% in the first quarter behind strong industry volumes and solid market share trends.\nWe remain excited about our prospects in these regions both for the opportunity to grow share in local markets as well as the ability to import activity back to the U.S. given the continued demand by global participants.\nTurning to Data Vantage. Net revenue grew over 8% in the first quarter with solid increases in all 3 components of our Data Vantage business, real-time market data, analytics and indices. Also of note, in Q1, we saw new recurring annual contract value, ACV, increased 47% year-over-year, a strong leading indicator for our business. As we redeploy a greater proportion of our technology resources to revenue-generating activities, we look forward to building on our positive 2025 sales trends. Taking a closer look at some of the first quarter dynamics, 55% of new data sales occurred outside the U.S. with efforts to improve access to the U.S. and European market for global investors by increasing our APAC sales force, adding more brokers in the region as well as rounding out our market intelligence group with local expertise, we are looking to lean into this secular trend.\nWe believe getting our data in the hands of more customers around the globe is not only beneficial for our Data Vantage business, but enhances our trading businesses as well. Historically, we have seen customers increase data consumption ahead of implementing trading strategies in new markets. In this case, international investors analyzing and back testing ahead of putting money to work in the U.S. or Europe.\nThe first quarter showcased the breadth and durability of the Cboe model. We look forward to building on the strong Q1 results and robust start to the second quarter through continued enhancements to our education efforts, broadening access to our markets and leveraging our differentiated set of products for investors around the world.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. Cboe posted a record first quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 16% on a year-over-year basis to $2.50. First quarter results reflected strength across our ecosystem and in each of our business segments. I will provide some high-level takeaways from this quarter's operating results before going through segment results.\nOur first quarter net revenue increased 13% versus the first quarter of 2024 to finish at $565 million with each of our categories producing healthy year-over-year growth. Specifically, Derivatives Markets net revenues grew 16%, Cash and Spot markets net revenues grew 10% and Data Vantage net revenues grew over 8%. Adjusted operating expenses of $192 million were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Driven by our strong business results and disciplined expense management, adjusted operating EBITDA of $385 million grew 20% and adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded by 4.3 percentage points to 68.1% versus the first quarter of 2024.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments, so I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe Options segment delivered another quarter of record net revenue with 15% year-over-year growth. Total options ADV was up 23%, with a 17% increase in index options volume and a 25% increase in multi-listed options volume. North American Equities net revenue increased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Access and capacity fees increased 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 9% decline in net transaction and clearing fees. The Europe and APAC segment produced record net revenue with an 18% year-over-year increase resulting from strong growth across both transaction and nontransaction revenues. Net transaction and clearing fees were up 30%, while nontransaction revenues were up a combined 8%.\nFutures net revenue increased 8% from the first quarter of 2024 with higher net transaction and clearing fees, reflecting a 13% increase in ABD. And finally, global FX record net revenue increased 16%, driven by higher net transaction and clearing fees.\nLooking at Cboe's Data Vantage business, net revenues were up over 8% on an organic basis in the first quarter. The ability to match an expanding product set with an increasing global sales presence and cloud distribution capabilities is a compelling combination. We saw this benefit play out more recently with our dedicated cores offering in time stamping services. And we believe the future remains great as we plan to continue to redeploy technology resources to revenue-enhancing activities.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were $192 million for the quarter, and roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Lower other expenses as well as travel and promotional expenses were partially offset by higher technology support services and depreciation and amortization expenses. Despite the first quarter favorability, we are leaving our full year expense guidance range unchanged at $837 million to $852 million. Our full year guidance takes into account the first quarter expense benefit from timing-related elements in our marketing spend. Moving forward, we would expect to see marketing-related costs reaccelerate.\nIn addition, given the continued strong results in April, we're projecting an uptick in short-term incentives in our compensation and benefits line. And finally, our guidance framework captures the expected expense impact of our CEO transition.\nOverall, we are pleased to be in the advantageous position to invest in our business, expanding areas like our global sales efforts and making further marketing campaign enhancements to investor education for our index options products globally, all while maintaining our strong operating efficiency to drive durable returns for shareholders.\nLooking at our 2025 guidance more broadly on Slide 16, we are increasing our full year total organic net revenue growth guidance range to mid- to high single digits from mid-single digits given the robust start to the year and confidence we have in our markets and products to provide utility to customers moving forward. We are reaffirming our Data Advantage organic net revenue growth range of mid- to high single digits on the back of solid first quarter results. And as mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted expense guidance range of $837 million to $852 million, rounding out the remaining pieces of our guidance.\nOur full year guidance range for CapEx remains at $75 million to $85 million, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the $55 million to $59 million range. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for the full year. And while we don't provide formal guidance on interest income or interest expense, we expect that interest expense net of interest income, will be in the $2 million to $3 million range in the second quarter of 2025.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We remain in a strong financial position with over $1 billion of adjusted cash on our balance sheet, an attractive debt profile with medium-term fixed rates averaging 2.8% and a low leverage ratio of 1.0x. We resumed open market share repurchases following our fourth quarter earnings call on February 7 and repurchased $30 million in shares during the remainder of the first quarter. We have continued our opportunistic repurchase activity to start the second quarter with an incremental $5 million in shares bought back in April. Complementing our share repurchase activity, we returned a total of $66 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.63 dividend during the first quarter.\nMoving forward, we remain focused on leveraging our flexible balance sheet and healthy free cash flow profile to produce durable returns for shareholders.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jill. The year is off to a strong start with excellent first quarter and robust beginning to the second quarter. And while volumes may ease from the exceptional levels seen in recent months, we believe the market ecosystem remains healthy and supportive of volume growth moving forward. Cboe is well positioned for Craig Donohue to take the reins. Many of you know Craig from his days at CME, where his track record speaks for itself. Craig brings decades of experience in the global derivatives markets and a history of driving growth and innovation to Cboe. His visionary leadership, deep experience, industry relationships, and proven track record in global financial markets make him an excellent individual to take the helm as CEO of Cboe.\nWhen I moved from the Board to CEO 18 months ago, my priorities were to stabilize the organization, sharpen our strategic focus, bring a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and leadership development and succession. Together with a strong management team, we have achieved these goals, and I'm proud of the results we have delivered. We are now executing on an orderly and well-planned CEO succession strategy. Craig will assume the CEO seat on May 7, upon which point I will transition to an advisory role through to the end of June. I look forward to working closely with him on a seamless transition and returning to my role as a non-employee Director of the Board. I am pleased to leave things in Craig and the executive management's team's very capable hands, having accomplished each of my goals as CEO. It's been an honor to lead this great company over the past 18 months. I am incredibly proud of our achievements and optimistic about the future of Cboe. I will now turn the call back over to Ken for Q&A.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your question to 1 per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits, we'll take a second question."

Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope the year is off to a great start for everyone. I'm pleased to report on strong fourth quarter and full year results for Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we grew net revenue 5% year-over-year to $524.5 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by 2% to $2.10 over a strong fourth quarter in 2023. These results capped another record year, which saw us grow net revenue 8% to a record $2.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share, 10% to a record $8.61.\nOur results for the year were driven by solid volumes across our derivatives business, Strong volumes across our cash and spot markets, growth of our data advantage business, formerly known as Datas and Access Solutions and more disciplined expense management. I'm incredibly pleased with the strong 8% net revenue growth in 2024, coming against a modest 6% increase in adjusted expenses, stabilizing our margins and driving a 10% improvement in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year.\nWhile the robust option volumes were a standout for 2024, the results were notable in that each category derivatives markets, data advantage and cash and spot markets contributed to the fourth quarter and full year growth. Record-setting trends drove broad-based growth across business lines as every major segment and category produced year-over-year net revenue growth in 2024. Our derivatives business delivered a solid year with organic net revenue increasing 8%, wrapping up another record year of option volume growth. Total volume across Cboe's 4 options exchanges was 3.8 billion contracts traded in 2024 with an ADV of nearly 15 million contracts traded a fifth consecutive record-breaking year.\nFor 2024, we saw record volume in SPX and fixed options, as investors turn to our S&P 500 volatility toolkit to help navigate markets. ADV and SPX options was a record 3.1 million contracts traded while ADV and VIX options was a record 830,000 contracts traded. Our Data Vantage business finished the year strong, driving a 7% increase in organic net revenue in 2024. The technology investments we made to further optimize access, data and insights for our Data Vantage business drove positive results for Cboe and our customers. We continue to see durability in this business as we leverage our global footprint and technology enhancements to drive growth.\nOur cash and spot markets performed well during the year as organic net revenue increased 10%, driven by healthy trading volumes and growth across all of our regional equities markets. Overall, it was an excellent year for both transaction and non-transaction growth capped by a strong fourth quarter for Cboe. As we entered 2025 with our sharpened strategic focus and framework we outlined last quarter we believe that we're well positioned for the secular trends that we expect to continue shaping the markets globally. The rising popularity and adoption of options trading, the continued rise of the retail investor, the globalization of markets and the rapidly evolving area of technology and data management, including newer technologies like artificial intelligence.\n2024 was another record-breaking year for the options market as more investors embrace the utility and versatility of options. Our derivatives business remains resilient supported by a growing customer base, demand for access to the U.S. market and an increasing demand for options. The combination of these trends moves that we're well positioned as we enter 2025 to further expand and enhance our derivatives ecosystem. With our diverse suite of products, we are well situated to help market participants navigate the elevated uncertainty we're witnessing across the market and geopolitical environment. We believe the new administration in Washington has a markedly different tone signaling a pro-business environment with regards to deregulation and tax cuts, fostering a bullish settlement.\nHowever, significant uncertainty remains around the strange geopolitical environment, combined with the record number of executive orders and the more recent tariffs coming out of the new administration, all of which injected volatility in the market. As markets evolve in response to these events, our SPX and VIX products provide an unparalleled toolkit for our investors to help seize opportunities and hedge their portfolios around the clock. We believe that the strong performance in the U.S. market with the S&P 500 index notching a return of more than 20% for 2 consecutive years will continue to attract new investors, both domestically and internationally. Through our SPX options complex, the ability to facilitate risk management and import foreign investment back into the U.S. market is expected to be a significant and growing opportunity that will be a top focus for us in 2025.\nOn the retail front, we continue to work with key retail broker partners across the globe to expand access to our products and education so more investors can leverage the numerous benefits of index options. I'm pleased to report that Cboe's index options are now available to all customers at Robinhood, one of the largest options trading platforms for retail investors. We believe that retail adoption of index options still has room to run and Cboe is well positioned to meet this growing demand through education, access and product innovation.\nOne of the core components of innovation is technology. And over the last year, we have reallocated capital and resources to rewards investment in our exchange technology platform. Last month, we unveiled a new brand identity for this platform, Cboe titanium, signaling an exciting new chapter in our ongoing evolution and commitment to delivering best-in-class trading technology for our market participants around the globe. Cboe titanium enables innovation across our markets, products, data and insights. All on a unified and scalable global technology platform. In every new market we have entered, our market share has improved following a migration to Cboe technology.\nAs we enter 2025, I'm excited about how Cboe is positioned. Our strategic framework as well as aligned to the secular trends we see in the capital markets we compete in and leverages our strengths. Our balance sheet is in a strong position that enables us to follow a disciplined and long-term approach to capital allocation, and we're well suited to invest in strategic organic growth opportunities that drive growth not just in 2025, but beyond.\nI'll now pass it over to Dave to discuss the business line results in more detail.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. Starting with our derivative business. On a full year base, net revenues were up 8%, led by another year of strong index options growth. We remain excited about the secular trends in place for our options business as SPX option volumes increased 7% year-over-year to a record ADV of $3.1 million in 2024. While VIX Options ADV hit a record high of 830% contracts up 12% from 2023 record. The fourth quarter showcased the utility of our S&P volatility toolkit in helping investors quickly and effectively navigate changing market conditions.\nWhile we saw a pickup in hedging demand going into the U.S. election, we saw a risk on rally that caught many investors by surprise following the results. [indiscernible] volumes jumped post election as investors use [indiscernible] to quickly adjust their portfolio. Meanwhile, VIX put volume surged higher as trade is positioned for a normalization and volatility. While volatility conditions and market outlooks changed, what stayed constant was the sustained growth in our Zero DTE options in both SPX and [indiscernible]. In the fourth quarter, SPX 0 DTE options ADV gained 8% quarter-over-quarter to nearly 1.6 million contracts, now making up over half of all SPX options ADV for the first time.\nSince we launched daily expirations on options on the Russell 2000 Index last January, up auction volumes have grown 11% year-over-year with the share of 0 DTE options trading doubling from 11% in January 2024 to 23% in January 2025. As we look ahead to this year, we see a sustained need for investors to stay nimble in the face of Engine monetary and viscose in the U.S. as well as rising trade tensions globally. We believe options are a great tool in these environments as they allow investors to quickly reposition and hedge their portfolios as market conditions change. Against this macro backdrop, we're excited to work towards broadening access to our products, increasing education efforts for all investors and showcasing the advantages of our expanding S&P volatility toolkit to help manage risk. On the access front, we are well aligned with the secular drivers of our business, including the rise of the retail investor. We are pleased with the early traction following the Robinhood launch in the fourth quarter and anticipate the increased volume from the platform will be additive to our proprietary product volumes as we expand access to more retail traders. With the expanded access on the Robinhood platform, customers are able to leverage the full advantages of index options from the simplicity of cash settlement and the certainty of European-style exercise to the potential 60-40 tax treatment.\nTurning to our international endeavors. We are excited by the import and export potential of our derivatives products. We anticipate that making investments in our sales and educational efforts around the globe will translate to greater volumes being imported back to the U.S. In the Asia Pacific region, specifically, we remain focused on expanding our presence in our 6 priority markets: Japan, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. By building a local sales force and educational tools tailored for local customers. During the fourth quarter, we saw 2 new brokers turn on access in our priority markets making Cboe products available for trading during global and regular trading hours. Outside our initial priority markets, we now have 2 brokers providing Malaysian investors with listed options. On the export side, [indiscernible] continued to add capabilities with over 320 single-stock company options available to trade from 14 countries and record levels of open interest to finish 2024. And on the innovation front, the fourth quarter was a busy 1 for our product development team as we introduced 2 new ways to trade S&P index volatility through various futures and VIX options on futures.\nGiven the introduction of these products, education will be a key focus in 2025 as we continue to grow the toolkit. To maximize the impact of these initiatives across our global derivatives platform we must have the right talent in place to drive success at Cboe. This week, I was incredibly excited to welcome Megan Dugan, who is joining the company as Head of U.S. auctions. In addition, we recently outlined several new hires and key promotions to further strengthen our business development, market intelligence and sales capabilities across the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. We expect 2025 to be a transformational year as we leverage a strong bench of talent to provide customers with improved access, enhanced education and continued innovation around our volatility toolkit.\nMoving to cash and spot market. The fourth quarter produced robust results with net revenues increasing 14% on a year-over-year basis. This capped a strong year where net revenues increased 10%, given solid contributions from all regions. 2024 was notable not only for the housing results but also the innovation across markets that helped drive improved market share in regions like Europe and Asia Pacific. As we near the end of our integration efforts in Canada later this quarter, we are excited to leverage the full power of our global and cohesive trading infrastructure.\nIn North America, 28% increase in net transaction and clearing fees during the fourth quarter helped improve net revenue for the segment by 10% on a year-over-year basis. Industry volumes were a tailwind. The 22% growth in the U.S. on exchange ADV, 5% growth in off-exchange ADV and 11% growth in Canadian ADV on a year-over-year basis. Capture in U.S. on-exchange equities improved 42% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 as we continue to strike the right balance between market share and capture to optimize revenue.\nIn Canada, we are excited to build on the solid 2024 trend as we anticipate completing the migration of our Canadian market to Cboe technology on March 3. Our Europe and Asia Pacific segment delivered impressive 17% year-over-year net revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 16% growth for the full year. The increases were driven by higher net transaction and clearing fees up 23% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. For Europe specifically, Cboe was the largest European stock exchange for the fourth quarter with our share of continuous trading volume hitting 33%, up nearly 90 basis points versus the third quarter's record level.\nThe results were again out by strength in periodic auctions with a market share of 87% with periodic auctions accounting for a record 9.6% of continuous trading during the fourth quarter. In Asia Pacific, we saw sustained progress in both Australia and Japan market share and industry volumes, driving year-over-year net revenue growth in the region.\nTurning to Data Vantage. Net revenue grew 8% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Results in the fourth quarter was driven by increases in all 3 components of our data advantage business. real-time market data, analytics and indices with notable strength in our dedicated course offering and proprietary market data. More broadly, on a full year basis, the record results were underpinned by 2 hallmarks of Cboe Data Vantage that we expect to carry through 2025 and beyond new product development and the ability to sell products across our global network.\nThe uptick from our U.S. dedicated [indiscernible] launch in 2024 exceeded our expectations. We have built on that success by rolling the product out across Europe and Australia in the first quarter of 2025, highlighting our ability to take a product working well in one region and replicate that success across our global network.\nWith our technology team shifting from migration work to revenue-generating activities, we look forward to further product development that leverages our scale infrastructure. Looking at our sales trends for Data Advantage more broadly, in 2024, we saw net new annual contract value hit record levels, increasing 33% year-over-year.\nInternational growth was healthy with 40% of new sales coming from outside the U.S. I'm excited to build on that global growth with a larger sales and educational resources footprint across the globe. This investment should help amplify the benefits of our global network. The fourth quarter, again, highlighted the power of the entire ecosystem at Cboe, with derivatives, cash and spot market and Cboe Data Vantage all delivering durable results. 2025 will be a year of focused execution for Cboe by providing more uniform access, greater education and leveraging our differentiated set of products for investors. January is off to a great start with Index options ADV running at record levels, trends that we look forward to building on in the year ahead.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. Siebel posted a solid fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 2% on a year-over-year basis to $2.10. The fourth quarter results continue to illustrate the strength across our segments that was on display during 2024.\nI will provide some high-level takeaways from this quarter's operating results before going through segment results. Our fourth quarter net revenue increased 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2023 to finish at $524.5 million. The growth was driven by strength in our cash and spot markets and data advantage categories as well as solid results from the derivatives business. Specifically, cash and spot markets organic net revenues grew 14% on a year-over-year basis with all geographies contributing to the growth. Data Vantage net revenues increased 8% on an organic basis during the quarter, and derivatives markets produced 1% net revenue growth versus a robust fourth quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 7% to $205 million for the quarter, with the year-over-year growth driven by higher travel and promotional expenses as well as technology support services expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $332 million grew 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments. So I'll provide some highlights for each. The Options segment produced another quarter of record net revenue, with 3% year-over-year growth led by higher multi-listed options transaction fees. Total options ADD was up 5%, driven by an 8% increase in multi-listed options volume.\nRevenue per contract decreased 5% as index options represented a lower percentage of total options volume during the quarter. North American Equities net revenue increased 10% on a year-over-year basis. Net transaction and clearing fees grew 28%, reflecting higher industry volumes and an improved net capture rate in on-exchange U.S. equities. On the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees increased 14% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The European APAC segment delivered a 17% year-over-year increase in net revenue. a result of strong growth across both transaction and nontransaction revenues. Transaction revenues across each region benefited from market share gains as well as increased volumes versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFutures net revenue decreased 7% from the fourth quarter of 2023 with lower net transaction and clearing fees, reflecting a 12% decrease in ADD. And finally, the FX segment recorded 3% year-over-year net revenue growth as a product of higher net transaction and clearing fees. Turning now to Cboe's Data Advantage business. Net revenues were up 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. International sales enhanced growth with 40% of new sales coming from outside the U.S. over the quarter. We believe Data Vantage is positioned to perform well in 2025. More specifically, we expect increased capabilities around our data, access and insights as we reallocate technology resources from integration efforts to organic revenue-generating enhancements. We anticipate growth will be aided by greater demand for access across our global markets, particularly as we increase our sales presence in new geographies and leverage the distribution capabilities of Cboe Global Cloud.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $205 million for the quarter, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase primarily resulted from higher travel and promotional expenses as well as technology support services expenses. I would note that the fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for travel and promotional expenses given our annual risk management conference. This year, we also saw an increase in our marketing spend, coinciding with the launch of index options on Robinhoods platform. While we plan to continue investing behind marketing efforts, as we see opportunities for returns for our business, we expect to see travel and promotional expenses move lower sequentially from fourth quarter levels.\nAs we look ahead on Slide 16 to our 2025 guidance, we anticipate our Data Vantage organic net revenue growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. and we expect our full year total organic net revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range. I would note that while we tweaked our guidance framework for 2025, both our Data Vantage organic net revenue guidance and our total organic net revenue guidance are in line with the ranges we provided under our previous guidance framework at this time last year. We are also introducing our full year 2025 adjusted expense guidance range of $837 million to $852 million, representing 4.8% growth on the lower end and 6.7% growth on the higher end.\nThe 2025 guidance accounts for modest growth in our core expense lines, while allowing for investment to help drive incremental revenue expansion across Cboe businesses. A few examples of the types of investments we plan to make include incremental sales hires in the APAC region, our securities financing transaction offering in Europe and continuing marketing efforts to improve investor education and monetize the expanding access to our index options products. Taking a step back, in 2024, Cboe produced 8% net revenue growth against 6% adjusted expense growth, stabilizing our adjusted EBITDA margin and expanding it by 30 basis points for the full year.\nWe believe the 2025 revenue and expense guidance outlined today strikes the right balance between investment for long-term growth and disciplined expense management as we look to drive long-term margin stability. Rounding out the remaining pieces of our 2025 guidance, our full year guidance range for CapEx is $75 million to $85 million, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the $55 million to $59 million range. The year-over-year increase in CapEx and depreciation and amortization reflect our efforts to sustainably invest in the business where we see long-term growth potential. A portion of the CapEx budget is also earmarked for our Kansas City office move, which is planned for this summer. We maintain a sizable presence with many of our technology and operations, finance and regulatory associates in the area, and we remain committed to investing in our people and culture.\nWe expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for the full year. And while we don't provide formal guidance on interest income or interest expense, I wanted to highlight that fourth quarter interest income outperformed our expectations, given some additional accounts that started to earn interest income and higher cash balances. We expect that interest expense net of interest income will be in the $5 million to $6 million range for the first quarter of 2025.\nThe last element I wanted to touch on as it relates to our 2025 guidance is the below-the-line items, earnings on investments and other income. In past years, we have provided detailed guidance on these items, but today, we believe that we have reached a more mature phase in our investment cycle and anticipate a more modest impact on our earnings and investments line in 2025. We anticipate other income will continue to grow gradually in line with cash dividends received.\nTurning to our balance sheet. The effective allocation of capital has been a cornerstone of our strategic review process. We take a long-term view on allocating capital to areas where we see the greatest return, whether it be organic investments or in the form of share repurchases, dividends or inorganic investments. In the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $66 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.63 dividend, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to $249 million for 2024. Factoring in both share repurchases and dividends for 2024, Cboe returned a total of $454 million to shareholders, representing 50% of adjusted earnings for the year.\nWe entered 2025 on a strong financial footing with $880 million of adjusted cash on our balance sheet, an attractive debt profile with low medium-term fixed rates averaging below 3%, and in an average leverage ratio of 1.1x. As we move forward, we anticipate leveraging our flexible balance sheet and healthy free cash flow profile to produce durable returns for shareholders.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up for Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nI'd like to thank the entire Cboe team for their incredible work in 2024 that led to record results. When I moved from the Board to CEO in September of 2023, my priorities were to stabilize the organization after the sudden departure of the previous CEO, sharpen our strategic focus, bring a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and leadership development and succession. On my first priority, unexpected succession require an experienced CEO to lead the organization through that challenging time. The management team has been stable since. Our current management team is a strong team that is more unified than ever and focused on executing our refocused strategy. Over the past 18 months, we've made significant progress sharpening our strategic focus and framework leveraging the core strength of our equity derivatives franchise. We're well positioned to benefit from the secular trends as we start the year. We have also changed our capital allocation strategy to focus less on M&A and more on investing in organic growth opportunities and allocating resources to line up behind our strategic focus.\nFollowing the completion of the 2 technology migrations this year, this will be the first time in 10 years that our technology resources will be fully focused on the business and driving on our strategy as opposed to focusing on migrations. Redeploying our technology resources enables us to leverage 1 of our greatest strengths to focus on strategic organic growth opportunities. The company now has a clear organic growth strategy, moderated expense growth and stabilized margins and attractive return of capital strategy and a strong balance sheet. As we enter 2025 on solid footing with a refined strategic focus and the financial flexibility to execute that strategy. while being well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, which brings me back to my last priority, leadership development and succession.\nCboe has been through a lot of change in the executive ranks over the last 18 months. But not only did we get through all that change, I believe we've come out stronger and more unified as a team. This is a credit to the strong management team I have around me. While the board and I have devoted considerable time to leadership development and succession throughout 2024, in the latter part of last year, a Board engaged a search firm to more formally assist with the process.\nWe have reviewed internal candidates and are also considering external candidates with the search room's heat. While the board and I are putting greater focus on my succession, I will continue to serve as CEO until a successor is appointed and will help ensure a smooth transition. Upon transitioning out of the CEO role I plan to remain a director on the Board. I will continue to work closely with the management team to execute our strategy and drive continued success for Cboe. We have many exciting initiatives underway and I remain steadfastly committed to ensuring we stay focused on our long-term goals.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken for Q&A.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'll be happy to take questions.

Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our strong second quarter results for Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we grew net revenue 10% year-over-year to a record $514 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by a robust 21% to $2.15. These results were driven by a contribution from each part of our ecosystem with improved volumes in our cash and spot markets, solid volumes across our derivatives franchise, specifically our proprietary index option of futures products, continued expansion of our Data and Access Solutions business and disciplined expense management.\nOur cash and spot markets category performed very well in the second quarter with revenue increasing 15% on a year-over-year basis. The contribution was broad-based with each of our global regions posting solid growth as compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nOur derivatives business delivered another solid quarter as organic net revenue increased 11% year-over-year. We saw solid volumes across our suite of S&P 500 index option products with second quarter ADV and the SPX contract increasing 9% year-over-year to 3 million contracts. We also saw strong year-over-year growth in our volatility product suite during the second quarter as ADV increased 8% in fixed options and 30% in VIX futures.\nGiven the secular and cyclical tailwinds in place, we believe we are well positioned as investors continue to utilize options in their portfolios and trading strategies.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business continued to deliver durable results with organic net revenue increasing 5% year-over-year for the second quarter and running at approximately 7% through the first 6 months. We are optimistic on our outlook for this business as we look to further leverage our -- network and ecosystem to drive growth.\nOverall, it was another solid quarter for both transaction and non-transaction revenues, wrapping up a strong first half of the year, which have seen us grow adjusted diluted earnings per share by [ 17% ]. We look forward to building on these strong results in the second half of 2024.\nFrom a strategic perspective, I remain centered on sharpening our strategic focus in areas where we see the most valuable growth opportunities for Cboe. Throughout the strategic review process, we have made a number of adjustments to our strategy including dialing back on M&A activities, reallocating resources to align with our core strengths, including winding down our digital spot market and refocusing on digital asset derivates, lowering our expense growth, stabilizing our margins and changing our capital allocation strategy away from M&A activities to increase investments in organic growth initiatives and returning capital to our shareholders.\nThe strategic review has provided us with the framework to hone our strategy and determine how to best leverage our core strengths, reallocate our resources internally, including investing in our global technology platform and position the company for continued growth over the longer term and returning capital to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nTo that end, refocusing our view of the company -- both in import and export business helps enable us to unlock even more global growth potential. Over the last few years, we have been very focused on the export type of business, expanding into new geographies and deploying our exchange technology and data to create better training experiences for our customers across the globe. We've also exported our U.S. derivatives market model to Europe, leveraging our proven blueprint for success in the U.S. to build out new markets and reach new customers.\nAs we enter these markets and listen to our customers, we found opportunities to grow our import business. For mine traveling and talking to our global client base over the last 9 months, I learned there is a huge appetite to invest in the U.S. market and our analysis confirms this trend. While our customers want to trade and invest in their local markets, they are also eager to gain access to the investment opportunities in the U.S. market. They are excited about the innovation that Cboe has brought to their markets and our investments in our technology, and they are optimistic about the investment opportunity that they continue to see in the U.S. market, representing nearly 45% of the $109 trillion global equity market cap, the U.S. equity marketplace is by far the largest and one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.\nForward holdings of U.S. equities reached nearly $14 trillion last year, growing at an approximately 10.5% CAGR over the last decade. And we expect this trend will endure as growth of the retail investor globally continues and different markets implement legislative changes that are expected to create opportunities for Cboe.\nThe S&P 500 Index is the dominant global equity benchmark with an estimated $16 trillion benchmarked index -- more than any country's individual market cap globally. Through our SPX options complex, the ability to facilitate risk management and the import of foreign investment back into the U.S. market is a significant and growing opportunity.\nWe continue to see significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific region specifically, where we see growing demand for our index options products -- serve as an efficient and accessible way to gain exposure to the U.S. market.\nIn the first half of this year, three global brokers, Futu Hong Kong; Webo, Thailand and Samsung futures added various Cboe products to their platforms, including SPX options, further expanding access to our product suite. We see this as a long-term secular trend, and we are eager to help facilitate access to the U.S. markets.\nInternational participants are highly valuable to the U.S. market as diversity of opinion and goal helps to lead to a better trading ecosystem. Whether it be through global trading hours, new products or education, we'll continue to help investors access the liquidity and efficiency of the U.S. market while also providing trusted market in local regions worldwide.\nWe believe the secular trends that are reshaping trading at capital markets, including the globalization of markets, the rise of the retail investor, the increased use of options by market participants to manage risk efficiently, generate income and take speculative positions and the technology and data revolution create excellent opportunities for Cboe.\nThe strategic review process has enabled us to examine long-term growth and value creation opportunities and reach position and redeploy resources to leverage our strengths against those opportunities we see in the market. The strategic review should be viewed as a journey and not an event, and you will see us continue to refine our strategy over time.\nFinally, we remain well positioned due to our strong balance sheet combined with our disciplined approach to the allocation of our capital. Our approach to capital allocation focuses on a balanced mix of reinvestment in core operations, including our technology platform, prudent expense management, strategic investments that drive sustainable growth and returning capital to our shareholders.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 90 million of shares and we'll continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase efforts. Overall, we -- to maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet while investing in organic growth initiatives, our technology capabilities, operating efficiencies and thereby driving durable revenue growth, optimize margins and earnings growth for the firm.\nI'll now pass the call over to Dave to discuss the business line results in more detail.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. Starting with our global derivatives category. Q2 was a tale of two halves. Volatility spiked in April on the back of rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East with the VIX index hitting a year-to-date high of 19 before falling precipitously in May and June, with July ranking as the least volatile month since November of 2019. Not surprisingly, index auction volumes were particularly strong in April with SPX recording its highest monthly ADV of 3.3 million contracts, driven by notable increase in put volumes as hedging demand picked up.\nWhile activity normalized in May and June, overall second quarter SPX ADV was still up a solid 9% year-over-year to 3 million contracts. 0DTE options made up 48% of overall SPX activity in Q2, unchanged from the previous quarter. VIX option volumes, on the other hand, surged higher in Q2, up over 18% quarter-over-quarter to an ADV of 843,000 contracts, making it the third largest quarter on record behind the first quarter 2018 and ahead of even Q1 2020's COVID-driven spike.\nInvestors have flocked to VIX options to help hedge against potential tariffs, whether it be geopolitical shocks or macroeconomic surprises with year-to-date ADV on track, they see that even last year's all-time high.\nOn the back of this unprecedented interest in VIX options trading, we're excited to expand the access and utility of Cboe's VIX product suite with our planned October launch of options on VIX futures, subject to regulatory review. These will be options that physically settle into the underlying front month of the future, and they will trade on our futures exchange, CFE.\nThis is important for two reasons: First, it allows us to provide access to VIX options products to a wider set of market participants in the U.S. and abroad that may not have access to our securities and options exchange; and second, it allows us to offer more tenants to meet customer demand.\nWe're especially excited to expand our volatility -- ahead of this year's U.S. election, which has historically been a meaningful volatility catalyst for markets and where demand for options to help manage risk is particularly strong. For example, the VIX index jumped over 10 points in the month leading up to both of the last two elections.\nIn addition to introducing options on VIX futures, we also plan to launch Cboe S&P 500 variant futures in September, subject to regulatory review. Cboe's variant futures will provide an exchange listed alternative to over-the-counter variant swaps and introduce yet another way to trade volatility around the U.S. election as well as other key catalysts.\nOur commitment to continually innovate is often cited by customers as one of the key reasons they're eager to partner with us. As we continue to make investments in our products and our markets, our customers are responding by increasing their collaboration with us, whether it be making enhancements to better compete in SPX 0DTE options, setting up to trade in GTH and the U.S. election or the international import of business as more retail growth has come online for options trading in different geographies. Strong client engagement and an exciting product pipeline makes us confident that we're well positioned to continue to grow our derivatives business for the rest of the year.\nOutside of the U.S. specifically, we continue to make sustained progress exporting our U.S. derivatives model to Europe, leveraging our blueprint in the U.S. by deploying our exchange technology to create better trading experiences for customers in Europe through our European derivatives platform, CLX. We saw the first equity options trade of CLX in June with nearly 14,000 lots traded in 201 distinct options during the first month of trading.\nOn the index side, spreads tightened on the back of our recently implemented liquidity provision program helping improve the quality of our book for index options. From a participant perspective, during the second quarter, we announced two noteworthy developments with the addition of Interactive Brokers as a direct training participant of CDX and a clearing participant in Cboe -- Europe in addition to IMC becoming new directly participant in June. While we still have a great deal of work ahead, we are pleased with the milestones -- during the second quarter and look forward to building on that momentum in the quarters ahead.\nTaking a look at the cash and spot businesses across regions, second quarter results were very strong with year-over-year net revenue growth reaching a robust 15%. Each region saw year-over-year increases as Cboe leveraged its scale infrastructure to monetize a healthy market backdrop.\nLooking at the various regions, in North America, U.S. on-exchange net capture rates improved markedly as a result of pricing changes we made in the first half of the year as well as a dramatic in customer mix given the mean stock activity. Moving forward, we expect to continue to look to strike the right balance between market share and capture to maximize the revenue outcome.\nIn Canada, we produced another 50 basis points of market share improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and remain on track with our final technology integration, the migration of our Canadian market to Cboe technology in early 2025, subject to regulatory review.\nMoving over to Europe, while closing auction activity hit another record high constituting an estimated 27% of on-exchange market share unavailable to Cboe in Q2, we retained our leading market position during continuous trading, accounting for 31% of intraday activity for the quarter. Periodic auctions also notched another market share record, and Cboe Bids Europe retained the distinction of the largest platform of its type for the 27th month in a row in June.\nAs we look to adjacent areas of the market for future growth, we remain on track for our fourth quarter launch of our securities financing transactions clearing services subject to regulatory review.\nAnd finally, turning to Asia Pacific, we, as continued strong momentum in Australia and Japan. In Australia, Cboe continued its market gains with market share for the quarter finishing at 20.8%, up [ 2.4 percentage points ] from the second quarter of 2023. In Japan, market share continues to set records, reaching 5.5% for the second quarter, a 1.4 percentage point improvement versus the second quarter of 2023. In addition, volumes increased by a very strong 71% as compared to Q2 of 2023 levels. Cboe's positive momentum in Japan has continued into the third quarter with solid volumes and market share.\nThe APAC region remains one where we are incredibly excited about moving forward. Not only do we see the opportunity to more effectively monetize our ecosystem of transaction and nontransaction business in local markets like Australia and Japan, but as we grow, we look for to fueling import of derivatives activity into the U.S. We anticipate making measured investments to maximize our brand and sales efforts in developing regions.\nWhile we are in the very early stages of realizing this opportunity, the onboarding of three new brokers out of Asia Pacific early this year highlights the underlying demand for exposure to Cboe's U.S. benchmark products.\nTurning to Data and Access Solutions. Net revenues grew 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2023. The slower second quarter growth was as a result of longer sales cycles and an outsized onetime backfill payment in our index business hitting in the second quarter of 2023 creating a more difficult comparison against softer-than-expected collections in Q2 of 2024. And whilst the first half results are trending slightly below our guidance range of 7% to 10% for the year, we anticipate the lower trends will prove transitory given initiatives we have in place to accelerate revenue expansion in the third and fourth quarters.\nGiven the year-to-date results and our second half expectations, we anticipate hitting the low end of our 7% to 10% guidance range in 2024. Specifically, on the Access Solutions side, we are excited about the momentum behind our dedicated cause offering, greatly enhancing our exchange access layer. Dedicated core is a new offering launched this year to help market participants improve determinism, reduce latency and enhance their ability to effectively navigate markets. We are currently live on all four of our U.S. equities markets with strong initial interest and have plans to roll out the technology in Europe in the fall.\nDedicated core is another example of leveraging Cboe's strong global technology infrastructure to provide scaled solutions to customers across our ecosystem.\nLooking internationally, approximately 40% of this quarter's growth came from outside of the U.S. We saw a notable uptick in Canada behind sales of our Cboe One data product as well as a solid momentum in Europe and Australia.\nAs we think about expanding our global footprint, Cboe Global Cloud has been instrumental in extending our activity with clients. During the second quarter, nearly 80% of Cboe Global Cloud sales came from outside the Americas.\nMoving forward, we anticipate being able to shift greater resources to the development of DnA opportunities as we move from the integration efforts with our technology and resources to revenue enhancing capabilities in our Data and Access Solutions category, particularly as it relates to enhancements around U.S. auctions in the quarters ahead.\nThe breadth of our cash and derivatives markets provides us with the unrivaled position to harvest, aggregate and deliver custom data sets and services closer to customers, both current and prospective and we look forward to investing behind those opportunities.\nCboe's second quarter results highlight the power of the entire ecosystem with cash and spot markets, Data and Access Solutions and derivatives all delivering durable results. And the third quarter is off to a great start. We look forward to leveraging the global footprint of our scaled infrastructure to enhance revenue generation across cash, data and derivatives.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. As Fred and Dave highlighted, Cboe posted a strong second quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $2.15, equaling our previous quarterly record. While the second quarter results are notable for a number of reasons, I believe the most powerful message to illustrate is our focus on driving margin stabilization as a result of durable revenue growth against diligent expense management as well as the robust capital return results on display throughout the first half of 2024. I will provide some high-level takeaways from this quarter's operating results before going through -- of the segment results.\nOur second quarter net revenue increased 10% versus the same quarter of 2023 to finish at a record $514 million. The growth was driven by strength in our cash and spot markets and derivatives categories as well as solid results from our Data and Access Solutions business. Specifically, cash and spot markets organic net revenues grew 15% versus the second quarter of 2023 with all geographies producing solid year-over-year growth. Derivatives markets produced 11% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter as our proprietary product franchise continue to provide increasing utility to the market. Data and Access Solutions net revenue increased 5% on an organic basis during the quarter. Despite the second quarter slowdown, we are confident in our ability to hit the lower end of our 7% to 10% targeted net revenue growth range for 2024.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased a modest 2% to $197 million for the quarter with the year-over-year growth driven by higher compensation-related expenses given the strong year-to-date revenue results as well as professional fees and outside services, offset by favorable results in travel and promotional expenses. And adjusted EBITDA of $341 million grew a healthy 16% versus the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, as a result of our strategic focus on revenue generation and diligent expense management, we continue to make meaningful progress in stabilizing our adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 3.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 66.3%.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments, so I'll provide some highlights for each. Net revenue in the options segment grew 8%, led by higher index options transaction fees. Total options ADV was up 1%, driven by a 9% increase in index options volume and revenue per contract moved 9% higher as index options represented a higher percentage of total options volume.\nNorth American equities net revenue increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to a record level in the second quarter, reflecting higher net transaction clearing fees and access and capacity fees. Increased net transaction and clearing fees were driven by stronger U.S. exchange and off-exchange net capture rates as well as higher volumes and market share in Canadian equities. On the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees increased 6% as compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nThe Europe and APAC segment produced a 15% year-over-year increase in net revenue, resulting from strong growth across both transaction and nontransaction revenues.\nTransaction revenue in Australia and Japan benefited from continued market share gains as well as greater volumes versus the second quarter of 2023. The future segment reported 19% net revenue growth for the quarter with the higher net transaction and clearing fees, reflecting a 28% increase in ADV.\nOn the nontransaction side, market data revenues were up 10%. And finally, the FX segment delivered a quarter of record net revenue with an 11% year-over-year increase driven by higher net transaction and clearing fees. Market share was 20.2% for the quarter, as compared to 19.5% in the second quarter of 2023.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up 5% on an organic basis in the second quarter. Net revenue growth continued to be driven by sales outside the U.S. with approximately 40% coming from international growth, the largest increase coming in Canada related to our Cboe One product. The strong second quarter international sales growth helped more than double overall sales annual contract value as compared to first quarter levels and highlights the many ways we can monetize our ecosystem of exchange networks across the globe. And while new sales may only provide a partial benefit in the quarter they occur, we believe the sales trends are a strong leading indicator of potential future revenue growth for the business.\nWe continue to believe DnA is well positioned and anticipate an acceleration in trends in the third and fourth quarters, helping us deliver on the lower end of DnA revenue growth guidance of 7% to 10%. More specifically, we expect to see continued strength from demand for access across our global markets, particularly as we increase our presence in new geographies and leverage the distribution capabilities of Cboe Global Cloud.\nThe expansion of dedicated cores, greatly enhancing our exchange access layer and increased capabilities around our U.S. options data and access as we reallocate technology resources from integration efforts to organic revenue-generating enhancements.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $197 million for the quarter, up a modest 2% compared to the second quarter of last year. The increase was a result of higher compensation and benefits as well as an increase in professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decline in travel and promotional expenses.\nLooking forward, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 adjusted expense guidance of $795 million to $805 million. Our guidance factors in stronger-than-expected revenue trends we have seen at the start of the year and supportive revenue expectations for the second half of 2024, putting some upward pressure on our short-term incentive bonus accrual, but is balanced by our strong expense discipline, leaving our overall guidance unchanged for the year. Importantly, the guidance provides opportunity for continued investment in the businesses. We anticipate that the continued reallocation of resources from integration efforts to areas like the DnA enhancements I just covered, or derivative technology upgrades and marketing spend will provide attractive returns in the quarters ahead.\nOutside of our adjusted expense goal, we recorded a number of onetime accounting adjustments I want to briefly touch on. Following the digital business realignment we announced in April, Cboe recorded an $81 million charge representing the noncash impairment of intangible assets related to the Cboe digital spot market wind down. In addition, we reported a $16 million impairment as a result of a routine review of the carrying value of Cboe's other minority investments. These charges are considered onetime and are excluded from our second quarter adjusted operating expenses.\nAs we look ahead on Slide 16 to our 2024 guidance, we are increasing our full year organic net revenue growth range to 6% to 8% from the higher end of 5% to 7%. The updated guidance reflects our strong first half results, solid July activity and a supportive outlook for the second half of the year.\nLooking at our full guidance more broadly, while we anticipate hitting our DnA organic net revenue guidance range of 7% to 10% for the year, we are guiding to the lower end of the range given the softer second quarter results. We anticipate a steady increase in DnA revenue growth throughout the back half of 2024, given incremental demand for our dedicated cores offering as well as continued geographic growth in our DnA business.\nOur expectation for nonoperating income is unchanged at $37 million to $43 million in 2024. We continue to anticipate $33 million to $37 million from positive marks on our investments to help our earnings and investment line and $4 million to $6 million in largely dividend income to flow through our other income line.\nOur full year guidance range for CapEx remains at $51 million to $57 million for 2024 and depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $43 million to $47 million for the year. And finally, we continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for 2024.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Our second quarter leverage ratio remained at 1.1x. We remain comfortable with our overall debt profile and the balance sheet flexibility it affords having locked in low, medium to longer-term fixed rates averaging roughly 2.8% on our outstanding debt.\nAs Fred highlighted earlier, a core tenet of the ongoing strategic review is the effective allocation of capital. As such, you have seen us pull back on our M&A activity, choosing to allocate capital to higher return internal projects or to shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased 90 million in shares, bringing total repurchases for the first half of 2024 to $180 million. We have continued our repurchase activity to start the third quarter, buying back an incremental $25 million in the month of July. Moving forward, we plan to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares as appropriate given our expected strong free cash flow generation and flexible balance sheet.\nAlso in the second quarter, we returned a total of $58.2 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. Factoring in share repurchases and dividends paid in the first half of 2024, Cboe returned nearly $300 million to shareholders, representing an attractive 65% of adjusted earnings being paid out as repurchases and dividends.\nAs always, we aspire to allocate capital and resources in the most value-enhancing way, striking the right balance between investing in future revenue growth and optimizing our margins. We look forward to building on our first half trends and delivering durable shareholder returns in the quarters ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nIn closing, we are pleased to report another strong quarter, delivering 21% growth in earnings per share year-over-year. That caps a strong first half with 8% net revenue growth and 17% earnings per share growth year-over-year as we have continued with strong revenue growth, brought down our expense growth and stabilized our EBITDA margins, reallocated our resources to invest in technology and organic growth initiatives and allocated our capital away from M&A towards strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders.\nFor the first half of 2024, we have returned 65% of our adjusted earnings to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our balance sheet is strong, and we're well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

Welcome, everyone, to the Cboe Global Markets first quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ken Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin your conference.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Fred Tomczyk, our CEO; and Dave Howson, our Global President, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update on the strategic initiatives. Then Jill Griebenow, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as discuss our 2024 financial outlook. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this call. During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Fred.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on strong first quarter results for Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we grew net revenues 7% year-over-year to a record $502 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by 13% to $2.15. These solid results were driven by strong volumes across our derivatives franchise, specifically our proprietary index option products; continued expansion of our Data and Access Solutions business; and disciplined expense management.\nOur derivatives business delivered another strong quarter as organic net revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We saw strong volumes across our suite of S&P 500 index option products with first quarter ADV and the SPX contract increasing 17% year-over-year to 3.2 million contracts.\nWe have also seen solid performance in our volatility product suite during the first quarter with fixed futures and options volumes further accelerating in April. Given the secular and cyclical tailwinds in place, we are well positioned as investors continue to utilize options in their portfolio and trading strategies.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business continued to perform well during the quarter with organic net revenue increasing 8% year-over-year. We continue to see durability in this business as we leveraged our global network and ecosystem of Data and Access Solutions to drive growth.\nNet revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets business was stable during the quarter as volume across global equity markets remain muted. Overall, it was a strong quarter for both transaction and nontransaction revenue growth to start the year.\nI continue to remain focused on 3 priorities that I believe will further strengthen Cboe and support our longer-term growth strategy: first, sharpening our strategic focus on areas where we see strategic growth opportunities for Cboe; second, the effective allocation of our capital; and third, developing talent and management succession.\nAs part of our strategic review process, coupled with the lack of regulatory clarity in the digital space, last week, we announced plans to refocus our digital asset business to leverage our core strengths in derivatives, technology and product innovation while realizing operating efficiencies for both Cboe and our clients. We plan to transition and fully integrate our digital assets derivatives currently offered by Cboe Digital into our existing global derivatives, harnessing the power of our global derivatives franchise and global technology platform to help support and fuel growth of the exchange-traded crypto derivatives market.\nWe plan to migrate our cash-settled Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts trading on Cboe's digital exchange to the Cboe Futures Exchange in the first half of 2025 pending regulatory review and certain corporate approvals. Additionally, we plan to wind down operations of the Cboe Digital Spot Market, our digital asset trading platform, in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory review.\nThe lack of clarity on the U.S. regulatory front for the cash spot business, combined with the lack of any time line to provide that clarity, among other considerations, has given us cause to change our strategic direction in the digital business to focus on where we have regulatory clarity and leverage our core strengths of derivatives, technology and product innovation.\nWith these changes, we are reallocating resources to focus on where we see as the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability, which is the continued expansion of our global derivatives franchise.\nOn the clearing side, we plan to align and unify our clearing operations globally and intend to maintain Cboe Clear Digital, which will continue to clear our Bitcoin and Ether futures. We believe these changes provide an opportunity to leverage our global derivatives platform, enhance efficiencies and sharpen our focus.\nOptimizing our business operations and product development across borders and asset classes enables us to better serve our diverse client base and sharpen our strategic focus. We continue to develop leadership in all functions across the company and optimize our organizational structure to support our global strategy. This realignment of our digital business into our derivatives and clearing business lines creates continued opportunities for development and growth within our senior leadership team.\nFinally, we continue to execute on a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The steps we are taking in our digital business illustrate our intent to allocate our resources and capital to the areas where we see the best returns for our firm.\nAlso, as demonstrated during the first quarter and through April, share repurchases remain an important component of our capital allocation framework, one, we plan to continue to use opportunistically in the market.\nOverall, we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet while investing in organic growth initiatives, our technology capabilities and operating efficiencies, thereby driving durable revenue expansion, optimized margins and earnings growth for our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Dave Howson to talk through how we are driving results within our strategy.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. Starting with the strong results in the global derivatives category. Despite the cyclical headwind of low volatility in Q1 with the VIX Index averaging just 13.7%, the lowest in over 5 years, SPX options volume remains strong. Average daily volume was up a robust 17% year-over-year to 3.2 million contracts, finishing just shy of the all-time high set in Q4 last year.\nIn fact, January and February ranked as the second and third highest SPX volume month on record through the first quarter. We believe investors took advantage of the low levels of volatility to more cheaply hedge their portfolio with SPX puts making up a higher share of the total volume.\nHedging demand was particularly strong in our VIX options suite with VIX core volume ADV up 4% quarter-over-quarter to over 500,000 contracts as investors took advantage of the low levels of VIX to our cheap tail protection. The resilience of our index options volume in the face of cyclical headwinds speaks to the strength of the secular drivers of our business, which we outlined in detail on the last earnings call.\nWe continue to lean into these and see further room for growth. For example, in January, we launched Tuesday-Thursday expiries for our Russell 2000 index options, completing the set of daily expiries to small cap stocks. While still early days, Russell 2000 index options volume hit a 5-year high ADV of 79,000 contracts in February. And the share of 0DTE volume grew from 8.7% in Q4 to now 12%.\nWithin our more established SPX product, volumes increased 17% year-over-year, and 0DTE options increased a robust 32% year-over-year and grew 3% from Q4 level to a new record of 1.54 million contracts. 0DTE options has made up 48% of overall SPX activity in Q1, up 2 percentage points from last quarter.\nThe rise of retail options trading is another secular trend we're excited to build on with more platforms coming online for index options trading later this year, giving retail investors expanded access to our products. To that end, we are thrilled to see our margin relief plan approved by the SEC recently, which we believe will make it easier for investors to overwrite index options on ETFs that track the same index. This is expected to benefit not just our SPX XSP options complex but also our Russell 2000 and MSCI suite of index options as well.\nOverwriting funds have grown tremendously in popularity in recent years with total AUM jumping more than sixfold since the pandemic to now over $130 billion. Anecdotally, we're also seeing more interest from the retail and RIA community in using these options to enhance their portfolio. We see this margin relief approval as an additional catalyst for wider adoption of options by the retail community.\nEven without a turn in the macro environment, we believe we are well positioned for the rest of the year as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. However, if we do get a shift in investor sentiment, as were vacated in April, we expect to benefit as traders harness the full versatility of our S&P 500 volatility tool kit.\nFor example, with the market set in April, VIX options volume surged to a 6-year high with daily volumes exceeding 2.6 million contracts on April 12 on the back of escalating Middle East tensions. That's higher volume than we saw during the 2020 COVID crisis despite the VIX index hitting a high of just 19 last month versus 82 in March 2020.\nVIX options through April are on pace to report its second highest quarter on record at current levels. While Q1 was characterized by a consistent market running amidst low volatility, Q2 is looking a lot more precarious amid heightened geopolitical tensions and greater macro uncertainty. As investors grapple with resurgent inflation, rising rates, not to mention the U.S. election later this year, we believe the need to use options to dynamically manage positions, hedge exposures and generate income only increases.\nAnd while trading metrics in North America remained strong during U.S. hours, volumes traded in U.S. products during non-U.S. hours continue to increase. During the first quarter, SPX global trading hours activity increased 41% as compared to the first quarter of 2023. And in April, we saw SPX GTH activity increase 73% versus Q2 2023 levels, and VIX GTH increased 69% over the same period. With GTH activity accounting for just 3% of April's SPX activity and less than 1% of VIX options activity, we continue to see an attractive path forward for non-U.S. customers to increase access to the U.S. markets.\nLooking at the business more globally. We hit some notable milestones on our European derivatives platform CDEC. Total index derivative volumes again hit record levels in March, besting the prior record by 26%, positioning us for future growth. We broadened the list of single-stock options traded on CDEC to more than 300 companies across 14 European countries at the end of March.\nAnd on April 1, we initiated and revamped our liquidity provider programs in the region. Client feedback has been promising. And we look forward to driving greater customer efficiencies through our pan-European approach to trading and clearing.\nDnA net revenues grew 8% compared to the first quarter of 2023 driven primarily by client expansion and additional unit sales of our expanding portfolio of access and data products.\nSpeaking to the breadth of DnA business, during the quarter, each region and every business line outside of digital for net revenue increased. In fact, 43% of data growth in the first quarter came from outside of the Americas. We saw outsized contributions from Australia, where DnA net revenue grew 19% and Europe, where net revenue increased a strong 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe future growth will be fueled by strengthening our distribution capabilities through areas like cloud, further expanding our index capabilities and providing greater access to our markets around the world.\nTaking a look at cash and spot businesses around the globe, first quarter results were solid. It's worth noting, though, our ability to expand our cash and spot reach benefits more than just our transaction revenues. The continued progress we make in these markets has the potential to add additional revenue streams in tangential areas around the globe.\nIn North America, we saw U.S. on-exchange net capture rates rebound from December lows to finish in line with first quarter 2023 levels. Furthermore, Canadian market share improved by 4 percentage points to 15.3% during the first quarter. And we remain on track with our final technology integration, the migration of our Canadian market to Cboe technology in early 2025, subject to regulatory review.\nMoving over to Europe. During the first quarter, Cboe Europe was the region with the largest exchange by value traded, a testament to the strong breadth of our product offering in the region. As we look to expand our capabilities into related areas with untapped addressable markets, we remain on track for a third quarter launch of our securities financing transactions clearing services, subject to regulatory review. Cboe SST business will clear stock lending activities for market participants.\nWith the introduction of stricter capital requirements, we believe now is the right time to leverage our clearing capabilities to bring a solution to the market with the potential to meaningfully reduce risk-weighted assets for our customers. We've secured the backing of 9 key industry participants, spanning banks, clearing firms, asset managers and custodians and look forward to bringing this service to market in the months ahead.\nAnd finally, turning to Asia Pacific. We saw strong momentum in Australia and Japan. In Australia, Cboe continued its market share gains with total market share for the quarter finishing at 20.4%, up nearly 2 percentage points from the first quarter of 2023. In Japan, not only did market share reach 5% in the first quarter, [ a full ] percentage point higher than the 2023 average, but volumes grew a robust 72% as compared to year ago levels. Those trends have continued in the second quarter with Cboe Japan market share hitting a single-day high of 6.5% on the 23rd of April. With our APAC integrations behind us, we look forward to competing more aggressively in the market to expand our transaction and nontransaction revenues.\nOverall, Cboe remains incredibly well positioned to consistently grow revenue across the firms. This means not only leading in a more established product areas like our index business, but allowing newer areas to leverage a robust infrastructure already in place.\nEarlier, Fred spoke to some of the key strategic impacts of our recently announced digital reorganization. I want to provide some additional context on how the move leverages our global derivatives and clearing capabilities.\nOn the derivative side, the reorganization reinforces the integrated global view we take with not only our derivatives franchise but all of our businesses at Cboe. By consolidating Cboe futures products onto one market, Cboe's Futures Exchange, also known as CFE, pending a regulatory review and certain corporate approvals, we can leverage the totality of our derivatives capabilities to grow our businesses while creating efficiencies for market participants.\nSpecifically, that means reducing complexity for clients by allowing them to connect to one global platform for all of their U.S. futures trading needs. As part of CFE, newer products like digital asset futures can leverage tried-and-true CFE capabilities to accelerate the go-to-market time line for products like options on futures and complex orders for digital products, expanding the toolkit of solutions available to clients.\nIn addition, these products will be able to tap into a seasoned and global sales force, a resilient technology infrastructure and a unified management team under the leadership of Kathy Play, our Executive Vice President of Global Derivatives.\nOn the clearance side, we are equally excited about the opportunities presented by unifying our clearing operations on a global basis. Vikesh Patel, currently President of Cboe Europe, will also oversee U.S. clearing. Cboe Europe will continue to operate as a pan-European central clearing counterparty for European equities and derivatives. Adding Cboe Clear Digital under the global clearing umbrella provides a cohesive clearing approach that spans equities and derivatives in Europe to Bitcoin and Ether futures in the U.S. The result is Cboe having great control of its product development destiny from ideation through to clearing considerations.\nAcross the firm, we continue to leverage our core strengths and find pockets of growth in our cash, data and derivatives categories. The first quarter of 2024 was very strong, and we look forward to driving further growth in the quarters ahead.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. As Fred and Dave highlighted, Cboe posted a strong first quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 13% on a year-over-year basis to a record $2.15. I will provide some high-level takeaways from the quarter before delving into an assessment of the segment results.\nOur first quarter net revenue increased 7% to finish at a record $502 million. The growth was again driven by the strength in our derivatives market and Data and Access Solutions businesses with steady results from our Cash and Spot Markets categories. Specifically, derivatives market produced 8% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the first quarter as we saw sustained growth in our proprietary product franchise during the quarter.\nData and Access Solutions net revenues also increased 8% on an organic basis during the quarter. We are pleased with the revenue trends and are confident in our ability to deliver on our 7% to 10% targeted net revenue growth in 2024.\nCash and Spot Markets net revenues were roughly flat to a year ago levels on an organic basis given stable results across our business segments. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% to $193 million with the year-over-year growth driven by higher compensation-related expenses and technology support services during the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA of $337 million grew a solid 9% versus the first quarter of 2023.\nImportantly, given our strong revenue generation and diligent expense management, we made material progress in stabilizing our adjusted EBITDA margins during the first quarter. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 1.4% on a year-over-year basis and by nearly 3 percentage points sequentially to an attractive 67.2%.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for our business segments. So I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe options segment delivered another robust quarter as net revenues grew 10%, led by higher index option transaction fees and growth in recurring nontransaction revenue. Total options ADV was up 1% driven by a 14% increase in index options volume. Revenue per contract moved 12% higher with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume. And access to capacity fees were up 7%, while proprietary market data fees increased 15% versus first quarter of '23.\nNorth American Equities net revenue decreased 1% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, reflecting lower industry market data and steady net transaction and clearing fees. In net transaction and clearing fees, a decrease in Canadian equities market volumes and net capture was partially offset by stronger U.S. off-exchange to capture rate, up 24% versus first quarter '23, given positive mix shift seen during the quarter.\nOn the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees increased 5% as compared to the first quarter of '23. The Europe and APAC segment reported a 10% year-over-year increase in net revenue driven by 20% nontransaction revenue growth across market data fees, access and capacity fees and other revenue. Transaction revenue in Australia and Japan benefited from another quarter of market share gains.\nThe Futures segment net revenue decreased 2% in the quarter primarily due to lower volume. On the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees continue to perform well, up 8% versus the first quarter of last year, and market data revenues increased by 10%. And finally, net revenue in the FX segment decreased 1% driven by a slightly lower net capture rate. Market share was 20.3% for the quarter as compared to 19% in the first quarter of '23.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up a solid 8% on an organic basis in the first quarter. Net revenue growth continued to be driven by solid new subscription and unit growth, accounting for 57% of market Data and Access Solutions revenue growth. We are pleased with the strong start to the year and believe that momentum across the suite of Cboe's businesses position us well to fuel our full year and medium-term DnA revenue growth guidance of 7% to 10%.\nMore specifically, we expect to see continued strength from demand for access across our global markets, particularly as we increase our presence in new geographies; proprietary data sales and options analytics, benefiting from the sustained growth across our derivatives complex; and finally, we anticipate a continued focus on our distribution capabilities, from market data to indices, adding to the enhanced distribution capabilities of Cboe Global Cloud.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $193 million for the quarter, up 4% compared to last year. The increase was a product of higher compensation and benefits and technology support services and partially offset by a decline in professional fees and outside services.\nAs we look ahead on Slide 16 to our 2024 guidance, we are lowering our full year 2024 adjusted operating expense guidance range to $795 million to $805 million from $798 million to $808 million. The updated guidance reflects our first quarter results, some reduced cost expectations as a result of the digital realignment as well as a slightly higher bonus accrual moving forward given our expectation to be at the higher end of our total organic net revenue guidance range for the full year.\nOn digital specifically, I want to walk through a few of the expected onetime and annualized impact of the announced realignment and revised digital strategy. Cboe expects a onetime estimated pretax charge of $39 million to $82 million primarily related to the noncash impairment of long-lived intangible assets, which is expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2024. These charges are expected to be considered onetime and excluded from adjusted earnings. We do anticipate roughly $2 million to $4 million of adjusted operating expense savings this year as we carefully wind down the spot digital asset trading platform in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory review.\nMoving forward, we anticipate the closure will generate annualized savings of $11 million to $15 million on an annualized adjusted operating expense basis. Overall, we believe the current expense guidance range gives us flexibility to invest in high-return areas of our business.\nLooking at our full year guidance more broadly. We are anticipating organic total net revenue growth to finish at the higher end of our 5% to 7% expected range for 2024. We are also reaffirming our DnA organic net revenue growth range of 7% to 10% for 2024, in line with our medium-term expectations.\nThis quarter, we are breaking out our other income line into earnings and investments and other income. Importantly, though, the aggregate benefit we expect to realize for nonoperating income is unchanged at $37 million to $43 million in 2024. We anticipate $33 million to $37 million from positive marks on our investments to help our earnings and investments line and $4 million to $6 million in largely dividend income to flow through our other income line.\nOur full year guidance range for CapEx remains at $51 million to $57 million for 2024, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $43 million to $47 million for the year. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for 2024. And finally, outside of our annual guidance, we expect net expense to be in the range of $9 million to $10 million for the second quarter of 2024.\nOn the capital front, we continue to maintain a flexible and attractive capital return policy for shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned a total of $58.5 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we repurchased [ 89 ] million in shares during the first quarter. We have continued our repurchase activity in the month of April, adding an incremental 27 million in repurchases during the month. Moving forward, we will look to opportunistically repurchase shares given our continued healthy free cash flow generation.\nTurning to our balance sheet. First quarter leverage ratio declined to 1.1x from 1.2x in the prior quarter as a result of solid EBITDA generation. Overall, we remain comfortable with our debt profile and the balance sheet flexibility it affords, having locked in low-, medium- to longer-term fixed rates averaging below 3% on our outstanding debt. As always, we aspire to allocate capital and resources in the most value-enhancing ways, striking the right balance between investing in future revenue growth and optimizing our margins. We look forward to building on the solid year-to-date trends and delivering durable shareholder returns in 2024.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank our team for the continued progress made throughout the first quarter. 2024 is off to a strong start, and we believe we are well positioned for another strong year.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Cboe Global Markets Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the call over to Ken Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.

Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us today. I hope 2024 is off to a great start for everyone. I'm pleased to report on strong fourth quarter and full year results for Cboe Global Markets.\nDuring the quarter, we grew net revenue by 9% year-over-year to a record $499 million and adjusted diluted EPS by 14% to $2.06. These results capped another record year, which saw us grow net revenue 10% to a record $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 13% to a record $7.80. Our outstanding results were driven by record trading volumes across our Derivatives business, continued durability and growth of our Data and Access Solutions business and disciplined expense management.\nOur Derivatives business delivered another record quarter as total organic net revenue increased 18%. As more investors embrace the utility of options to help navigate any market environment, we saw total options average daily volume increased to a record 14.9 million contracts driven by a 24% increase in index options.\nWe saw record volumes across our suite of S&P 500 index options products with fourth quarter ADV and the SPX contract increasing 22% year-over-year to 3.3 million contracts. We also saw solid performance in our volatility product suite with VIX options up 33% year-over-year.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business continued to perform well, and we continue to have a strong conviction in this business going forward as we look to unlock value and revenue opportunities across the globe. During the quarter, organic net revenue in our Data and Access Solutions business increased 7%.\nNet revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets businesses decreased during the quarter, finishing a year of more muted volume activity across global equity markets. Overall, it was a strong quarter for both transaction and nontransaction growth that capped an excellent year for Cboe.\nOver the last few years, Cboe has built out a unique global derivatives and securities network. With the network largely built, nearly all the acquisitions integrated, we are now turning our attention to unlocking the value of this network through strategic organic growth initiatives.\nAs I highlighted last quarter, I'm focused on 3 key priorities that I believe will further strengthen Cboe and enhance shareholder value over the longer term: one, sharpening our strategic focus; two, effective allocation of our capital; and three, developing talent and management succession. We are working through our strategic review now, but I wanted to provide you some framework of how we're approaching this process.\nFirst, we're analyzing the sector trends driving market activity today and how we can continue to maximize our core competencies and leverage our global platform and superior technology. We continue to see several key secular trends reshaping trading and capital markets. As I sit here today, both trends continue to gather momentum and propel our business forward.\nFirst, the globalization of markets and subsequently, our customer base. Our global customer base wants access to all of our trade capabilities. They're looking for efficiencies and a consistent experience trading across asset classes and geographies, which we can deliver.\nSecond, the unprecedented rise of the retail customer has transformed U.S. market in recent years. As with many global trends, we believe what has transpired in the U.S. market will evolve to other global jurisdictions as those markets typically follow a similar evolution.\nWe believe this new generation of retail investors is here to stay and becoming more sophisticated as they increase their use of options to help execute their trading and investing strategies. We continue to see opportunity to service this key segment as the retail wave expands globally.\nFinally, technology and data, including emerging areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, continue to transform the world we live in and is a fuel that helps drive trading in our markets and products. As our customers engage with markets around the world, high-quality technology and easily accessible, relevant data is paramount.\nWhat differentiates Cboe and enables us to leverage these trends is our core strengths. First, our global footprint that we've now assembled; second, our renewed focus on superior technology; and three, our emphasis on greater product innovation. Our recent acquisitions have helped us to own these core strengths, and we now have a solid foundation for continued organic initiatives that we expect to drive revenue growth and earnings growth in 2024 and beyond.\nToday, we are the only truly global derivatives and securities exchange. Our global equities footprint spans 7 of the top 10 global equity markets, creating an unrivaled consistent trading experience for our global customer base. These equity markets have provided strong and consistent cash flow generation for our business. But importantly, we see securities markets as the foundational element, table stakes in creating products and services that span the equities and derivatives landscape.\nAnother strength is our technology, which has enabled us to be nimble and efficient operator of securities markets around the globe. With 2 major technology migrations completed last year in Australia and Japan, we now have all but one of our equities and equity derivatives markets running on our common technology platform.\nOur final technology integration is planned to take place in early 2025 with the migration of our Canadian market to Cboe technology. With nearly all of our acquisitions fully integrated, we are well positioned to unlock the incremental value from our global network by investing in organic growth initiatives in all of our businesses while enhancing and leveraging our global technology platform.\nOver the last 2 years, our product innovation has driven an incredible evolution in the options market that makes us even more confident about the durability of our business. We've seen an increasingly diverse set of market participants turning to shorter-duration options across our SPX complex, continuously hedging and repositioning on a day-in and day-out basis, not just during times of market volatility.\nPrior to the launch of Tuesday and Thursday options in the spring of 2022, 0DTE as a percentage of SPX activity was in the low 20% range. In 2023, that reached 45% for the year and moved to 50% in January. With some product innovations like 0DTE drive immediate volumes, we know with other innovations like standing up a new derivatives market in Europe take time. The remarkable thing about our business is that the core engine can continue to churn and produce revenue in the short term while we continue to incubate new markets for long-term growth.\nIn summary, we remain focused on creating a healthy ecosystem of products and services that create short-, medium- and long-term opportunities, helping to enable a cadence of consistent growth. Additionally, we remain well positioned due to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. During the fourth quarter, we paid off all of our outstanding variable rate debt, and we're in a very good place with our leverage ratio as we begin 2024.\nWe remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet while investing in organic growth initiatives, our technology capabilities and operating efficiencies to drive revenue growth and optimize our margin and thereby drive earnings growth.\nFinally, talent development and succession planning remains a priority for me. We continue to develop leadership in all functions across the company and optimize our organizational structure to support our global strategy.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. As we enter 2024, we are well positioned to capitalize on those trends and build on our record 2023 results. You have heard me speak in the past about the foundational elements that make up our ecosystem and the process we follow on moving up our cash, data and derivatives value ladder. I want to start by outlining the ways we have strengthened the Cboe foundation before looking at how we plan to unlock organic value across the ecosystem in 2024.\nStarting first with the Cash and Spot Markets. In 2023, we enhanced our presence in every major market opens competition around the globe, making the biggest advancements in the Asia Pacific region. In March 2023, we completed our technology migration and BIDS rollout for Cboe Australia. And in the fourth quarter, we completed our technology migration and launch of the BIDS network in Japan. This migration not only provided a uniform infrastructure to enhance our performance and trading capabilities in the region, but it unlocked opportunities across our value ladder for incremental data product offerings and the ability to add adjacent asset classes over time.\nWith the Australian migration complete nearly a year ago, it serves as the most recent example of this expansion strategy in action. Since the [indiscernible], Cboe Australia has seen a solid increase in its market share with Cboe's continuous cash market share finishing December at 21.2%, up 3.5 percentage points as compared to December of 2022.\nThe benefits of our regional expansion are not isolated to cash equity set. As we move up the value ladder, we see Data and Access Solutions in this region grow with Australian market data and access services growing by 11% in 2023.\nThe gains in Australia are illustrative of the broader globalization trend benefiting the Data and Access Solutions business. In fact, the fourth quarter represented the highest quarter ever for data sales to customers outside the U.S.\nCboe Global Cloud, our real-time data streaming service, allows customers efficient access to Cboe's robust suite of market data products. Today, nearly 80% of our cloud customers are located outside of the United States with the demand for 24/7 access to markets and market data only growing.\nLast on our value ladder but certainly not least, as we think about expanding our Derivatives capabilities, we remain steadfast in our efforts to bring U.S. market experience to global participants. Shifting market behavior takes time, and we are still in the early stages of this journey, but we are well aligned with the global ambitions for our broker-dealer partners.\nWe see Europe as a market ripe for this evolution with the value of volume traded for equity and index options running at just 6% of the size of the value traded in the U.S. despite comparable GDP. In the fourth quarter, our European derivatives exchange, [indiscernible], posted its best quarter since launch with volumes up 85% year-over-year.\nMore importantly, completing our index trading capabilities in the region, we successfully launched our single options offering in November. We currently have options on 127 companies in production today with plans for over 300 names later this quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and expect to commence a liquidity provider program in the months ahead. The movement of the value ladder from cash to data to derivatives provide the framework for establishing a flywheel of revenue generation.\nTurning to Slide 8. It was another record quarter for SPX and a record year for the overall Index business as investors turn to our S&P 500 volatility toolkit to help navigate markets. SPX options volumes grew a robust 31% to a record ADV of 2.9 million contracts in 2023. Activity in the fourth quarter was a record 3.3 million contracts.\nNotably, while volumes grew across the board, we saw a more pronounced jump in coal volume as investors turn to options to adjust their portfolios in the face of changing market conditions. Meanwhile, we continue to see sustained traction in our 0-day to expiry options. 0DTE activity grew a remarkable 60% year-over-year to comprise 45% of overall SPX activity. These ultra short-dated options have given investors the ability to hedge risk, generate income and express directional views more precisely and frequently.\nIn our VIX complex, as markets rallied last year, volatility levels fell with the VIX falling from an average of 26 in 2022 to 17 in 2023. The lower VIX levels drove core buying as investors look to the complexity of VIX options to help protect against potential black swan event.\nOverall, VIX ADV jumped 40% to a record 743,000 contracts last year. As volumes continue to grow, so does the demand for new data sets, indices and tradable products. We have many noteworthy developments over 2023.\nIn partnership with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we launched the Cboe 1-Day Volatility Index in April, options on futures for our Cboe iBoxx Bond Index futures in July, the Cboe S&P 500 Dispersion Index in September. And in October, we further expanded our benchmark VIX methodology by launching a new suite of 4 credit volatility indices.\nTurning to Slide 9. As we start 2024, we see a supportive backdrop unfolding for our index products, aided by both strong secular forces and cyclical tailwinds. The increased utilization of options as a tool has been underway for decades, but we are still just scratching the surface on widespread adoption.\nInvestors have become increasingly sophisticated over the years and interest, we've looked to foster through our leading investor education platform, the Options Institute. With additional online platforms planning to offer cash settle products in the year ahead, we see a runway to higher levels of accessibility and activity across our suite of derivative products.\nAs you heard me mention earlier, the opportunity to bring a U.S. market experience to global participants is increasingly compelling. While our current assets are aimed at providing a single access point to trade pan-European products, over time, we expect to leverage our access to other regions like Asia Pacific.\nToday, this shows up both directly through the continued growth in global trading hours activity. In 2023, SPX GTH expanded by a robust 85%, and fixed GTH activity was up a solid 45%. Despite the growth across the complex, GTH for SPX options still represent under 3% of overall activity. And GTH for VIX options made up [indiscernible] 1% of all VIX volume, leaving meaningful potential for expansion.\nAs we have seen in other markets, traders continue to demand greater flexibility in managing their risk profile. The growth in 0DTE activity speaks to the burgeoning need to manage intraday risk at greater levels.\nImportantly, this trend remains firmly in place across market cycles and volatility ratios. Magnifying the impact from the structural tailwinds I just covered, there are a number of cyclical factors working in our favor today. A common misconception that we often hear is that we need higher volatility or a market sell-off to drive options volume growth.\nAs you can see from the chart on the slide, this is far from the truth. Investors have turned to options to help manage risk when the outlook is uncertain. However, it's important that risk runs both ways.\nAnd as we saw in Q4, investors turned to options to help manage the upside potential in the market, buying calls to quickly increase the equity exposure in the face of falling 10-year rates. In fact, our Q4 2023 record volume days all occurred on market updates. And the last quarter was a record period for our SPX complex despite the index moving 11% higher and volatility levels falling dramatically.\nWe believe the options provide an increasingly durable stream of revenue. Unlike cash equity products, options expire on an increasingly frequent basis, particularly as investors embrace shorter-duration trading strategies. This means that traders must continuously reassess the market, putting on and adjusting positions to manage risk, hedge exposure or generate income.\nTurning to Slide 10. I want to reinforce some of our more recent product innovations. In January 2024, we increased access to shorter-duration products with the launch of Tuesday and Thursday expiring Russell 2000 and Mini Russell 2000 index weekly options, providing small-cap investors with some of the same tools available to SPX trader.\nFor XSP, despite the roughly 80% ADV growth produced during 2023, we are even more excited about the potential for the XSP contract in 2024. We believe potential margin relief from the SEC will allow additional customers to benefit from XSP's many advantages. Overall, the potential for regulatory approval coupled with a likelihood for our cash-settled products to be offered on additional online platforms should help catalyze incremental XSP uptake.\nOn the data side, our partners play an important role in our growth. In 2024, we are excited to expand our collaboration with MSCI to include the launch of 2 new volatility indices and 3 new tradable products subject to regulatory approval. This is a great example of our continued relationship with MSCI and the growing demand for both more volatility indicators and tradable products to better manage market risk.\nTouching more broadly on our Data and Access Solutions business on Slide 11, we posted another record quarter results with revenues increasing 7% on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, DnA grew 9% with organic growth making up 7.5 percentage points of a 9% growth. The year-over-year growth was again driven by client expansion and additional unit sales of our expanding portfolio of access and data solutions.\nOutside of our cloud capabilities that I mentioned earlier, we saw the opportunity to grow our business by strengthening our distribution capabilities, expanding our index capabilities and providing greater access to our markets around the world.\nI started my prepared remarks outlining the process we follow when building out our ecosystem of capabilities. As we think about the key trends across our businesses, we believe we are well aligned in each of our major categories. This not only helps drive more durable revenue generation for more established products like our SPX suite but also allows for the build-out of newer initiatives that can leverage a robust infrastructure already in place.\nDigital assets is one such product that touches each segment of our ecosystem. As we see markets increasingly move digital, we believe there will be greater demand for trusted and transparent markets.\nWe were honored to have been chosen as a listing venue for 6 of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs made available for trading in January. Looking beyond the listing, cash trading and data benefits, a more vibrant crypto ecosystem is advantageous to our recently launched margin futures product.\nIn January, Cboe Digital became the only U.S. regulated exchange to offer spots, leverage derivatives and clearing on a single platform. 2024 is off to a strong start, and we look forward to capitalize on the numerous opportunities across our business to drive long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. As Fred and Dave highlighted, Cboe posted a strong fourth quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 14% on a year-over-year basis to $2.06, equaling our previous quarterly record. On a full year basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 13% to a record $7.80 as Cboe generated strong net revenue growth of 10%, hitting a record $1.9 billion for 2023.\nI am incredibly pleased with the 2023 results and will provide some high-level takeaways from the quarter before delving into an assessment of the segment results and our 2024 guidance.\nOur fourth quarter net revenue increased 9% to finish at a record $499 million. The growth was again driven by the strength in our Derivatives market category and the solid results from our Data and Access Solutions business.\nSpecifically, Derivatives market produced 18% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the fourth quarter as we set numerous records across our proprietary product franchise for the fourth quarter and full year. Data and Access Solutions net revenues increased 7% on an organic basis during the quarter. We are pleased with the revenue trends and are confident in our ability to deliver durable growth in 2024.\nCash and Spot Markets net revenues decreased 11% during the quarter on an organic basis, given headwinds in our North American Equities business. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% to $192 million with the year-over-year growth driven by higher compensation and benefits during the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA of $321 million grew a solid 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2022.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics of our business segments, so I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe Options segment provided robust growth to cap an outstanding year. Net revenue grew 15% led by a strong contribution from our Index business and favorable revenue per contract trend, given the mix shift to index options. Total options ADV was up 2% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 24% over fourth quarter 2022 level. Revenue per contract moved 20% higher, given a continued positive contribution of higher capture index products. And access and capacity fees were up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nNorth American Equities net revenue was down 10% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter driven by lower net transaction fees. The decrease was driven by a decline in our U.S. equities on exchange net capture as unfavorable mix shift and higher client volumes pushed more clients into higher tiers, resulting in a negative impact on our overall net capture rate.\nWith our recent fee filings, we have already taken steps to enhance our capture dynamics while maintaining market share as we look to maximize revenue potential for the segment. Partially offsetting some of the headwinds in the U.S. on-exchange business, Canadian equities and our BIDS businesses were solid for the quarter. And on the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees increased 7%, and proprietary market data was up 6%.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported a 9% year-over-year increase in net revenue as stronger nontransaction revenues and favorable foreign exchange trends again outpaced volume headwinds in European Equities. Market data, access and capacity and other, which includes the positive impact of interest income during the quarter, were up a combined 14% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction revenue in Japan and Australia benefited from solid market share gains.\nThe Futures segment reported the strongest year-over-year growth of all of our segments for the quarter with net revenue up a robust 21%. Activity in the segment accelerated as volumes increased 21% on a year-over-year basis, and rate per contract improved by 2%.\nOn the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees continue to perform well, up 6% versus the fourth quarter of last year. And market data revenues increased by 15%.\nAnd finally, net revenue in the FX segment notched another quarterly gain, growing by 12%, making it the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue gains for the segment. Net transaction fees revenue was up 8% as average daily notional value increased by 15%, and market share hit another record at 21.3% for the quarter.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up a solid 7% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total net revenue growth to 9% and organic net revenue growth to 7.5% in 2023.\nNet revenue growth continued to be driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for 84% of the organic market data growth and just over half of the organic access and capacity fees growth during the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the organic net revenue trends for the segment and believe the momentum positions us well to hit our 2024 and medium-term guidance range of 7% to 10%.\nMore specifically, we expect to see continued strength from increasing demand for access across our global markets, particularly given our leverage to growing asset classes and expansion into new regions, proprietary data sales and options analytics benefiting from the sustained growth across our derivatives complex. And finally, we anticipate a continued focus on our sales effort to distribute our content globally for market data to indices, adding to the enhanced distribution capabilities that the Cboe Global Cloud presents.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $192 million for the quarter, up 9% compared to last year. The increase was a product of compensation and benefits, given higher headcount as well as higher technology support services to support the investment in our key growth initiatives during the quarter.\nAs we look ahead on Slide 18 to our 2024 guidance, we are introducing our full year 2024 adjusted expense guidance range of $798 million to $808 million. After 2 years of relatively elevated expense growth as we integrated numerous acquisitions and invested heavily in growth initiatives, we are slowing the pace of expense growth to help provide greater margin stability moving forward.\nOur 2024 expense guidance of $798 million to $808 million represents roughly 6% growth on the bottom end and 8% growth on the top end or just under a 5% increase at the midpoint if using the fourth quarter of 2023 at the baseline. Importantly, this lower growth rate should not be [indiscernible] to the lack of desire or ability to invest in attractive long-term growth opportunities across our businesses, but rather highlight a more refined effort to manage expense growth to better align with revenue generation and stabilize the margins of our businesses.\nLooking at our full year guidance more broadly, we are introducing an organic total net revenue growth range of 5% to 7% for 2024. This is in line with our medium-term guidance of 5% to 7% introduced over 2 years ago as we continue to execute on our vision for the company.\nWe are also introducing a DnA organic net revenue growth target range of 7% to 10% for 2024, also in line with our medium-term expectations. The DnA category has been a durable growth driver over the years, and we remain comfortable in our ability to hit our objectives in 2024.\nIn the other income line, we anticipate a $37 million to $43 million benefit in 2024 from positive marks on our investments in the 7RIDGE fund, which owns trading technologies. Our full year guidance on CapEx calls for an expected range of $51 million to $57 million in 2024. And depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $43 million to $47 million for the year. We expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% for 2024.\nAnd finally, outside of our annual guidance, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $11 million for the first quarter of 2024.\nBefore moving on from our guidance section, I want to spend a minute on Slide 19 to highlight how Cboe has performed against our medium-term expectations historically. Looking back over the last 6 years, we performed well against our target as we've executed on our strategic ambitions.\nOur goal for the last few years has been to grow total organic net revenue by 5% to 7% and organic DnA revenue by 7% to 10% each year, something we have consistently achieved. Given the durable nature of both our nontransaction and transaction businesses, particularly given the increasingly recurring nature of our Derivative franchise, we believe we are well positioned to build on our historical performance and look forward to innovating and leveraging our global platform.\n2024 is off to another strong start. And as we have done in the past, we will fine-tune our annual guidance expectations to reflect the current environment throughout the year.\nOn the capital front, our focus remains maximizing long-term shareholder value through effective capital management. In the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $58.5 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we repurchased $5.8 million in shares at the end of the fourth quarter. Moving forward, we will look to opportunistically repurchase shares, given our continued strong free cash flow generation.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We paid down the remaining $75 million on our term loan facility during the quarter. Our fourth quarter leverage ratio declined to 1.2x from 1.3x in the prior quarter as a result of the debt pay down.\nOverall, we remain comfortable with our debt profile and the balance sheet flexibility it affords, having locked in low-, medium- to longer-term fixed rate averaging below 3% on our outstanding debt. Embedded in our expense, revenue and capital expectations, we are always looking to strike the right balance between investing in future growth and optimizing our margins. We look forward to executing on our growth drivers in the year ahead and delivering solid shareholder returns in 2024.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nWe are excited about both the near- and long-term opportunities to grow and expand our business and believe we have strong momentum as we head into 2024. We are well positioned to leverage our global footprint, our leading-edge technology and continued product innovation to unlock the value of a global network that Cboe has built. And I am excited about the opportunities we see to drive revenue and earnings growth across our platforms.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

Please note that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Fred Tomczyk, our CEO; and Dave Howson, our Global President, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update of our strategic initiatives. Then Jill Griebenow, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as discuss our 2023 financial outlook. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be Chris Isaacson, our Chief Operating Officer; and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.\nI would like to point out that this presentation will include the use of slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nDuring our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties.\nActual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.\nDuring the call this morning, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Fred.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Ken, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. Having taken the helm at Cboe 6 weeks ago, I've been impressed with the strength of the Cboe team and our focus on our clients, which has resulted in another strong quarter for the company.\nFor today's call, I will highlight our overall results and share my priorities as Cboe's new CEO. I will then hand it over to our Global President, Dave Howson, to walk through the [indiscernible] we made against our strategic priorities.\nI am pleased to report record third quarter adjusted earnings for Cboe. During the quarter, we grew net revenue by 9% year-over-year to $481 million and adjusted earnings per share by 18% to $2.06. These results were driven by record activity across our Derivatives business, the continued growth of our Data and Access Solutions business, lower third quarter operating expenses and a lower corporate tax rate.\nOur Derivatives franchise delivered another record quarter as total organic net revenue increased 15%. As the uncertain macro and geopolitical environment impacted markets globally, investors and traders relied on our suite of index options and volatility products to help manage risk and generate income in an uncertain environment.\nWe believe our Derivatives business remains incredibly resilient, supported by a growing customer base and an auctions product that is becoming increasingly recurring in nature as investors shift to shorter-duration expirations and more frequently positioned around changing market environments.\nDuring the quarter, organic net revenue in our Data and Access Solutions business increased 9%. Net revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets business decreased by 6% during the quarter, reflecting the muted volumes we saw across global equity markets. These solid results were made possible by the continued execution of our strategy to build the world's largest derivatives and securities network and position Cboe for a strong finish to the year.\nNow as a Cboe Board member for the last 4 years, I've been very close to the business and support of the team as Cboe expanded and evolved into the leading global derivatives and security network that it is today. The company has a solid foundation, a global ambition and a strong management team that I'm honored to lead.\nIn my new role, I am primarily focused on 3 key priorities that I believe will further strengthen Cboe and enhance shareholder value: first, sharpening our strategic focus; second, effective allocation of our capital; and three, developing talent and management succession.\nWhile I arguably support Cboe's strategic direction, I see opportunity to refine this strategy to provide a clear focus on the core elements of our business that drive revenue and earnings growth. I believe a sharpened strategy will enhance the margin profile of our business and increase shareholder value over the longer term.\nI will also focus on ensuring our capital allocation plan is delivering the kind of returns our shareholders expect from Cboe. I'm intent on increasing the efficiency of our investments that we make across the business to generate durable revenue growth.\nFinally, talent development and succession planning, which is always an important component of any CEO's duties and responsibilities, will be a priority for me.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave Howson to talk through how we are driving results within our strategy.\n\nDavid Howson\n\nExecutive VP & Global President\n\nThanks, Fred. As Fred noted, our strategy yielded solid results during the third quarter as we continue to advance our top strategic growth priorities: Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and Digital.\nBefore moving to the record results for our Derivatives and D&A businesses, let me provide an update on our Digital segment. We are working with our customers and the CFTC on final preparations for the planned launch of margin futures in the first quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. With this launch, Cboe Digital will be the first U.S. regulated crypto-native exchange and clearinghouse to offer spot and leverage derivatives on a single platform. We look forward to bringing this unique product to market.\nTurning to Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions. Last month, we made important leadership changes to further support our global growth strategy. Cathy Clay, who previously led our Data and Access Solutions business, was appointed to Global Head of Derivatives, a new role for the organization as we reorganized the team for the next chapter of global growth.\nFurthermore, we tapped our strong bench of talent to promote Adam Inzirillo to Global Head of Data and Access Solutions. By aligning our organizational structure to the global nature of the business, we anticipate harnessing the full strength of Cboe, increasing efficiency and collaboration across business lines and regions while enabling us to better deliver world-class products and services in a globally consistent manner to our clients.\nTurning to Derivatives on Slide 8. It was another record quarter for the business as traders and investors turn to our flagship S&P 500 and VIX Index products to help navigate the uncertain macro environment.\nSPX volumes surged 21% to a record ADV of 2.9 million contracts in the third quarter, while our Mini-SPX contract, XSP, jumped 82% year-over-year. Within SPX, the fastest-growing segment continued to be the 0-day to expiry options, gaining 33% year-over-year. Investors use these for hedging, income generation, expressing views on market direction and more.\nThe diversity of use cases is why we expect to continue to see strong and sustained volume in 0 DT options regardless of what the market is doing or where the VIX is trading. These options have opened up a whole new risk premium for investors to capture, namely intraday risk.\nAnd as uncertainty increases regarding the longer-term macro picture, interest in capturing shorter-term trends and dislocations have led to a higher share going to 0DTE options, now comprising around 48% of all SPX volumes in the third quarter. However, it's important to note that while the 0DTE options are making up a bigger part of the pie, the pie itself is growing as well.\nOther expiries are also seeing higher volume, including our standard monthly SPX options contract that expires in the third Friday of every month. We believe that bonds are being used less as a diversifier of equity risk, and investors are increasingly turning to auctions to help hedge their portfolios.\nThat hedging demand helps explain why VIX auction volumes have been so strong with ADV surging 60% year-on-year, even as overall VIX levels stay muted. Investors use VIX options primarily to protect against potential black swan events, which typically happen when volatility levels are low or in other words, when least expected.\nWe believe the [indiscernible] of buying VIX call options is to potentially capture that complex move if the VIX triples or quadruples, something that is harder to do when the VIX Index was in the mid-20s last year versus the mid-teens this year. With macro and geopolitical risks arising across the world, we're seeing strong global demand for our products with SPX and VIX options ADV during global trading hours increasing 95% and 10%, respectively, year-over-year.\nAs markets change, our Derivatives product suite remains well positioned for customers in any market environment. Our VIX and SPX products anchor a remarkable [indiscernible] that allows customers to choose the right product size and expiry to meet their needs, be it risk management or income generation.\nComplementing the burgeoning activity posted by our Derivatives business, Cboe is continuously working to expand its suite of data products to enhance the overall trading ecosystem. In collaboration with S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe's product innovation arm, Cboe Labs, recently launched several new benchmark indices for market participants.\nWe were incredibly excited to bring to market the Cboe S&P 500 Dispersion Index known by ticker DSPX as well as our 4 new credit volatility indices. Early market reception has been extremely favorable as each of these indices is designed to provide investors with key information to help them better manage their strategies and portfolios, potentially fueling further growth in our tradable products.\nOn the innovation front in Europe, we are excited about the upcoming launch of single stock options on the Cboe European Derivatives Exchange beginning next week. The commitment secured from leading market participants ahead of the launch highlight the opportunity to materially advance the European options market for clients.\nAs we plan to introduce a liquidity provider and market-maker programs in the first quarter of next year, subject to regulatory approvals, we anticipate volumes on the platform to grow. We see the launch of single stock options as a key milestone for our European derivatives initiative and our broader ambition of creating the leading marketplace to manage risk around the globe.\nMoving to Slide 10. Our Data and Access Solutions business posted record results during the third quarter with net revenue increasing 8.7% on an organic basis. The durable year-over-year growth was fueled by an expanding global customer base and an evolving portfolio of market data solutions.\nThrough our bundled data offerings and cloud strategy, we can package high-quality data from across markets and deliver it to customers globally in a consistent and cost-effective manner, extending the addressable market for this business. We continue to see solid customer adoption of Cboe Global Cloud, a real-time data streaming service that provides simple, effective access to Cboe's robust suite of market data.\nNearly 80% of customers utilizing this service are located outside of the Americas, reflecting our expanded global footprint. Additionally, through our cross-region sales efforts, many customers are subscribing to multiple [indiscernible] products offered by Cboe Global Cloud, given the simple, efficient access to high-quality data this service affords.\nAs we look across our global network on Slide 11, we continue to build on a solid foundation of our global cash equities business, where we have a strong presence in 7 of the top 10 global equity markets serving a diverse customer base. While overall performance in our Cash and Spot Markets reflected the muted volumes we saw across global equity markets during the quarter, we are upbeat about the long-term potential.\nIn Asia Pacific, Cboe Australian market share grew to 17.9% in the third quarter, up from 16.7% in the previous year as momentum continued to build post our technology migration. Later this month, we expect to complete the technology migration of Cboe Japan through our world-class technology stack and launched Cboe BIDS Japan subject to regulatory approvals, further extending our unique block trading network to this important market. We are grateful to our customers for their partnership and look forward to providing them with the best-in-class trading experience that our global customers have come to rely on at Cboe.\nIn Europe, the Cboe Europe Equities business reported market share of 23.2%, while Cboe BIDS Europe experienced another strong quarter and remained the largest block trading venue in Europe. Cboe Clear Europe market share grew to 33.8% in the third quarter, up from 33.2% in the prior year quarter.\nIn North America, Canadian equities market share rose to 15.2%, up from 12.2% in the third quarter of 2022. While U.S. equities market share fell to 12.7% compared to 13.3% in the prior year period, Cboe's addressable market share, which excludes closing auctions and off-exchange volume, remained stable.\nLastly, our Global FX business had another record quarter. Net revenues were up 6% year-over-year in the third quarter as the business expanded spot market share to a record 20.2%, up from 17.8% a year ago.\nOur NDF offering, which trades on Cboe SEF, our swap execution facility, continue to see strong results with volumes increasing 19% year-over-year with ADV of $1.1 billion. These record results were driven by new client growth and increased utilization of our platform by existing clients.\nIn summary, Cboe delivered another outstanding quarter. And we see strong momentum as we head into the final months of the year and into 2024. With our strong foundation of Derivatives, Cash and Spot Markets coupled with our Data and Access Solutions, we will continue to harness the power of our market to deliver innovative products and services to our customers. As we sharpen our strategy and focus, we see even more opportunity for Cboe to maximize its global potential and drive further value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Dave. As Fred and Dave highlighted, Cboe posted a record third quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share of 18% on a year-over-year basis to $2.06. I want to provide some high-level takeaways from the record quarter before delving into an investment of the segment results.\nOur third quarter net revenue increased 9% to finish at $481 million. The growth was again driven by the strength in our Derivatives market categories and the solid results from our Data and Access Solutions business.\nSpecifically, Derivatives market produced 15% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the third quarter as traders and investors found increase in utility in our toolkit of proprietary products. Data and Access Solutions net revenues increased 9% on an organic basis during the quarter. We are pleased with the revenue growth acceleration we have seen through 2023 and remain excited by the continued momentum into year-end.\nCash and Spot Markets net revenues decreased 6% during the quarter on an organic basis as the trade environment remained muted across the globe. Adjusted operating expenses increased a modest 4% to $180 million with the year-over-year growth tempered by a $10 million benefit from executive changes made during the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA of $321 million grew a solid 12% versus third quarter of 2022.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release in the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics from our business segments. I'll provide some highlights for each.\nThe Options segment, again, provided the highest growth of any segment for the quarter. Net revenues grew a robust 14%, led by a strong contribution to our index business and favorable revenue per contract trend, given the mix shift to index options.\nTotal options ADV was up 8% as our higher-priced options ADV increased 28% over third quarter 2022 levels. Revenue per contract moved 12% higher, given the continued positive contribution of higher capture index products. And market data and access and capacity fees were up 19% and 5%, respectively, as compared to third quarter 2022.\nNorth American Equities net revenue was down 2% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. While access to capacity fees increased 6% and proprietary market data was up 4%, U.S. industry volumes remain a headwind for the segment.\nNet transaction fees were down 11%, given softer industry volumes and market share in our U.S. businesses. And while our U.S. on-exchange market share has trended lower on an absolute basis, our share remains stable when adjusting for the increase in off-exchange market volume and auction activity during the third quarter.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported a 2% year-over-year increase in net revenue as stronger nontransaction revenues and favorable foreign exchange trends were tempered by volume headwinds.\nMarket data, access and capacity and other, which includes the positive impact of interest income during the quarter, were up a combined 18% on a year-over-year basis. This outperformance was tempered by softer industry volumes in Europe, down 13% versus the third quarter of '22.\nIn the Futures segment, third quarter net revenue was up 14% as net transaction fees, access capacity fees and market data revenue each produced double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter. Activity in the complex accelerated as volumes increased 12% on a year-over-year basis.\nOn the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees continue to perform well, up 14% versus the third quarter of last year, and market data revenues increased by 16%.\nAnd finally, net revenue in the FX segment notched another quarterly gain, growing by 6%, making it the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue gains for the segment. Net transaction fees revenue was up 5% as average daily [indiscernible] value increased by 8%, and market share had another record at 20.2% for the quarter.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up a strong 8.7% on an organic basis. Net revenue growth continued to be driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for 2/3 of the organic market data growth and just over half of the organic access and capacity fee growth in the third quarter. The uptick in pricing for access and capacity fees was driven by the first pricing increase we have passed through in over 5 years for physical connectivity to our multi-exchange network.\nLast quarter, we spoke to selectively increasing pricing to support innovation and keep pace with the utility we provide to market. We intend to continue to lead with new user and unit growth as we provide exceptional value to our customers. But we'll remain mindful of competitive pricing and our need to support continued innovation for our products.\nWe are pleased with the overall acceleration in organic net revenue trends for the segment and believe the momentum positions us well to hit our full year and medium-term guidance range of 7% to 10%. More specifically, we expect to see continued strength from proprietary data sales benefiting from the sustained growth across our Derivatives complex.\nIn Australia, we continue to see a solid uptick in data sales and access and migration. We expect that momentum to continue. And finally, we anticipate a continued focus on our sales effort to distribute our content globally, adding to the enhanced distribution capabilities that Cboe Global Cloud presents.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $180 million for the quarter, up 4% compared to last year. The modest increase was a product of higher technology support services and professional and outside services fees to support some of our key growth initiatives and an increased travel and promotional spend, given higher ongoing corporate marketing expenses. These higher year-over-year changes were partially offset by a 6% year-over-year decline in compensation and benefits, given a $10 million benefit to executive changes. As we have historically done, we did not adjust for the impact of executive departures, but we would not expect the impact to be a recurring element in the Cboe expense base.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are lowering our full year 2023 expense guidance range by $12 million to $754 million to $762 million from $766 million to $774 million. The 3 basic components of full year expense builds are outlined on Slide 18 of our earnings presentation: expenses from 2022 acquisitions, core expense growth and growth investments.\nLooking at the details of our 3 expense categories. The incremental 2023 expenses from our 2022 acquisitions remains at $30 million to $31 million, following a reduction in expenses earlier in the year. [indiscernible] change in our overall expense forecast comes in the core expense category, now calling for growth of $51 million to $55 million versus our prior expectation of $59 million to $64 million. The reduction is a product of the strong expense management trends we are seeing this year, as highlighted in our third quarter results and modest growth expectations moving forward.\nIn addition, we have recalibrated our cap-related costs given our updated expectations. Overall, we expect core expenses to grow by 8% in 2023.\nMoving on to growth-generating investments. We anticipate that the investments we are making in the business to help drive incremental revenue to our bottom line will be in the range of $21 million to [ $24 million ]. Our new range is roughly $3 million to $4 million lower than our prior range, but we remain committed to investing in high-return areas like D&A expansion, a more aggressive marketing campaign and targeted products and services R&D efforts across our ecosystem.\nLooking at our full year guidance more broadly on the next slide, we are making some positive refinements to our forward outlook across our businesses. At a high level, we are reaffirming our organic total net revenue growth range of 7% to 9% for 2023 and expect to finish at the high end of the range for the year.\nAs a reminder, this remains above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 7% introduced at our Investor Day nearly 2 years ago, a function of the durable innovation we have seen across the entire ecosystem at Cboe. As mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our D&A organic net revenue growth rate of 7% to 10% for 2023, in line with our medium-term expectations.\nGiven the company's positive marks on its investment in the 7RIDGE fund, which owns trading technologies, we are again increasing our expected benefits to the other income line. Our new guidance range of $38 million to $44 million is $4 million above our prior range of $34 million to $40 million.\nOur full year guidance on depreciation and amortization remains at $40 million to $44 million. And we expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 27.5% to 29.5%, down from our prior guidance of 28.5% to 30.5% in 2023.\nOutside of our annual guidance, net interest expense for the third quarter of 2023 was $12 million. For fourth quarter, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $11 million to $12 million.\nOn the capital front, our focus remains maximizing long-term shareholder value through effective capital management. In the third quarter, we returned a total of $58.5 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend.\nIn addition, last week, we announced an increase in our share repurchase authorization, adding $250 million to bring our total capacity to $390 million available for share repurchases. We remain well positioned to invest in our business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares, given our continued strong free cash flow generation.\nTurning to our balance sheet. We paid down $90 million on our term loan facility that matures in December of this year during the quarter. Our third quarter leverage ratio declined slightly to 1.3x from 1.4x in the prior quarter as a result of the debt pay down.\nSince the end of the third quarter, we have paid down the remaining $75 million on our term loan facility. Overall, we remain comfortable with our debt profile, having locked in low, medium- to longer-term fixed rates averaging below 3% on our outstanding debt. Moving forward, we will continue to put capital to work in value-enhancing ways across our ecosystem while looking to strike the right balance between investing in future growth and driving margin efficiency.\nBefore I turn the call over to Fred for some closing remarks, I want to congratulate Ken Hill, who was recently promoted to Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Since joining Cboe in 2021, Ken has made an incredible impact with our Investor Relations program, and I'm delighted for him to expand his leadership with the Treasurer role.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Fred for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nFrederic J. Tomczyk\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Jill. In summary, I want to thank the entire Cboe team for the warm welcome and the incredible achievements over the last quarter. Cboe's success this year and over the last 50 years is a testament to the enduring strength and resiliency of the team, who continue to rise to any occasion and deliver results. I'm very excited about the future of Cboe Global Markets.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

During the quarter, we grew net revenue 10% year-over-year to $467 million and adjusted EPS by 7% to $1.78. These results were driven by strong volumes across our Derivatives franchise, specifically our proprietary index options products and the continued global expansion of our Data and Access Solutions business.\nOur Derivatives business delivered another outstanding quarter as total organic net revenue increased 21% driven by the strength of our index options and volatility products and continued solid volumes in multi-list options trading. During the quarter, total net revenue in our Data and Access Solutions business increased 9%, and organic revenue growth increased over 7%.\nTotal net revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets business decreased 11% during the quarter. Cboe's efforts to achieve its environmental, social and governance goals continue to gain momentum. Last month, we published our fifth annual ESG report, in addition to disclosing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. This year, for the first time, we disclosed our relevant Scope 3 emissions in our report. We plan to continue to make strides forward each year with our ESG program.\nIn the second quarter, we advanced our top strategic growth priorities, which include Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and Cboe Digital, recording wins across each of these priorities during the second quarter. I will turn to Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions in a moment. But first, I want to provide an update on Cboe Digital.\nDuring the quarter, Cboe Digital recorded solid volumes with ADV of more than 50 million and $4.6 billion total traded on our spot [indiscernible]. We were also pleased to receive regulatory approval to expand our product offering to include margin futures contracts, which we plan to launch later this year, making Cboe Digital the first U.S. regulated crypto-native exchange and clearinghouse platform to offer leverage to [indiscernible] products.\nThe initial product rollout will include physically and financially settled Bitcoin and Ether contracts and will help enable customers to trade futures in a much less capital-intensive way. We are working with our customers and the CFTC in preparation to launch and look forward to bringing this unique product to the market.\nAs the digital asset market continues to evolve, we remain highly active in discussions with regulators and policymakers. We continue to see engagement from market participants about the opportunities this asset class affords. And we'll continue to leverage our trusted, transparent and regulated market structure to advance the industry forward.\nOur Derivatives [indiscernible] continued to flourish in the second quarter as traders and investors utilize our flagship VIX and S&P 500 index options products across an ever-changing market environment. As we have evolved our suite of products in recent years, we have created flexible products that provide opportunities for customers of all dimensions to trade a contract that is rightsized for them on a time frame that suits their unique needs. Together, our VIX and SPX products anchor a remarkable tool kit that is available for investors to help find opportunity and hedge portfolios in changing market environments.\nDuring the second quarter, volume in our proprietary index options products increased 38% year-over-year, while multi-list options increased 2%. In June, we reached new record monthly ADV of 3.9 million total index options contracts traded.\nSPX options ADV increased 33% to a record 2.8 million contracts during the quarter. We also continue to see strong momentum in our many SPX options contract known by its ticker symbol XSP, which increased 142% year-over-year. ADV for SPX options opened on the same day of expiration, otherwise called 0DTE, comprised nearly 44% of overall SPX volumes in the second quarter.\nAs we've noted before, we believe there has been a fundamental evolution in how customers are trading this product, and we anticipate this volume to continue. Given the strong customer interest, we continue to focus on the development of a short-term tradable product that is designed to allow customers to more effectively trade [indiscernible] in the market.\nWhile interest in 0DTE trading has gained a lot of attention, we continue to see strong volumes in our standard monthly SPX options contract that expires in the third Friday of every month with average open interest up 12% in June of 2023 compared to 1 year ago. While the VIX Index remained at historically low levels during the second quarter, we saw a significant increase in trading activity in VIX options with a 53% increase year-over-year to an ADV of 778,000 contracts, our fourth best quarter on record.\nGiven the flexibility and utility of both VIX and SPX options [indiscernible] changing market environment, we see customers utilizing both products interchangeably to manage and hedge their risk. And globally, demand for our products continued with SPX and VIX options ADV during global trading hours increasing 81% and 16%, respectively, versus the second quarter 2022.\nThrough our strong foundation of proprietary index options products, we are able to further expand our diverse offerings with new products designed to help meet the evolving needs of our growing global customer base. Last month, we launched options on our corporate bond index futures, bringing in new options on futures functionality to Cboe futures exchange, which we can leverage for additional products in the future.\nThis quarter, we also anticipate that FINRA will receive regulatory approval for new margin requirements recently adopted by Cboe related to cash-settled index options written against ETFs that track the same index underlying the option. Specifically, customers who are writing options against indices that are offset by underlying ETF, for example, access [indiscernible] long [indiscernible] stock will receive margin relief, enabling greater capital efficiencies in their trading.\nAnd in partnership with S&P Dow Jones Indices, we plan to launch a new Cboe S&P 500 dispersion index next month. Dispersion is recognized as one of the fundamental metrics of market risk, a strategy that is predominantly traded in the over-the-counter market. This new index aims to standardize the measurement of S&P 500 dispersion.\nAdditionally, we are preparing for the launch of single stock options on our Cboe Derivatives exchange in the fourth quarter of this year with active engagement from market participants and other members of the ecosystem who share our vision of growing the market and delivering a simpler and more efficient pan-European trading and post-trade experience. We look forward to providing an update on these initiatives during our next earnings call.\nTurning to our Data and Access Solutions business. We continue to see solid growth with total net revenue increasing 9%, up 7% on an organic basis during the quarter. The second quarter results build on the strong demand we see globally from customers for our high-quality data and access to our markets.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we anticipate new opportunities across our Data and Access Solutions ecosystem will drive further growth, including demand for Australian equity market data now that Cboe Australia has migrated its exchange technology to Cboe's uniform trading platform.\nAs we continue to leverage our global footprint and expanded customer base, we also see opportunity to expand our reach of our proprietary data products, such as our Cboe One data feeds and Cboe Global Indices offering. We continue to focus on our sales and marketing efforts in new regions to introduce market participants to the unique value proposition of our unrivaled data offering.\nDuring the second quarter, we announced the launch of Cboe global listings, a first of its kind global listings network, which aims to facilitate worldwide access to capital and secondary liquidities for companies and ETFs. Our new listings offering draws on our deep markets expertise, regional experience in all of the jurisdictions where we operate and the combined strength of our global equities exchange network to provide a locally optimized and centrally coordinated listing services and support for issuers.\nThe expansion of our listings business rounds out our global equities offering, helping to enable market participants around the globe to utilize Cboe markets for more uniform access to equity trading, market data and listings. Performance in our Cash and Spot Markets reflected the overall muted volumes we saw across all global equity markets in the second quarter.\nIn Europe, Cboe Europe equities business increased second quarter market share by 1 percentage point year-over-year to 23.8%. Additionally, Cboe BIDS Europe experienced another strong quarter with 35.8% market share and remained the largest European block trading venue.\nCboe Clear Europe market share grew to 33.8% in the second quarter, up from 31.3% in the prior year quarter. During the quarter, Cboe Clear Europe also announced plans to introduce securities financing transactions or SFTs in 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. Cboe aims to bring this new service to the market to help ease capital requirements for market participants through a centrally cleared service for stock lending. SFT is yet another example of Cboe taking market feedback, leveraging our expansive ecosystem and building tangible solutions for our customers.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. Cboe Australia market share grew to 18.2% in the second quarter, up from 17% in the previous year. In Japan, equities market share was 4.1% during the second quarter, up from 3.5% in the second quarter of 2022. And we remain on track for the Cboe Japan technology migration and expected launch of Cboe BIDS Japan in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval. With the launch of Cboe BIDS Japan, the BIDS network will now extend to 7 of the top 10 global equity markets, creating a one-of-a-kind global equity block trading network.\nIn our Global FX business, net revenues were up 7% year-over-year in the second quarter as the business expanded spot market share to a record 19.5%, up from 17% a year ago. Our NDF offering, which trades on Cboe SEF, our [indiscernible] execution facility, continued to see strong results with volumes increasing 23% during the second quarter with ADV of 937 million.\nTo meet this increased customer demand, we launched a new London matching engine for Cboe SEF during the second quarter. With Asian currency pairs accounting for a significant portion of Cboe SEF volumes, this new matching engine is expected to enhance our service to customers based in Asia and Europe, further diversify our order flow on the platform and create greater matching opportunities for our clients.\nIn summary, Cboe delivered another solid quarter, building on our record first quarter results. With our strong foundation of Derivatives, Cash and Spot Markets coupled with our Data and Access Solutions, we have the ability to continue to harness the power of these markets to create new products and services that deliver innovative products to our customers. We will continue to plant the seeds of opportunity that will help allow us to harvest investments across all seasons to drive consistent growth and value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jill.\n\nJill M. Griebenow\n\nCFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Executive VP & Treasurer\n\nEd, thank you for that kind introduction. I couldn't be more excited to build on the strong momentum at Cboe today. As Ed highlighted, Cboe posted a strong second quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share up 7% on a year-over-year basis to $1.78. The performance was led by continued strength from our Derivatives franchise as well as the steady contribution from our Data and Access Solutions business.\nAs we have done in prior quarters, we look to maximize long-term shareholder value through monetizing today's opportunities while investing in future growth initiatives. I want to highlight some high-level takeaways from the strong second quarter performance before providing a more detailed assessment of our segments.\nOur second quarter net revenue increased 10% to finish at $467 million driven by the [indiscernible] of our Derivatives market category and the solid results from our Data and Access Solutions business. Specifically, Derivatives markets produced 21% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the second quarter as the market continued to find increasing utility in our toolkit of proprietary products. Data and Access Solutions net revenues increased 9.4%, up 7.4% on an organic basis during the quarter.\nWe are pleased with the sequential organic revenue improvement in the second quarter and remain excited by the catalyst we need to see in the second half of the year. Cash and Spot Markets net revenues decreased 11% during the quarter or 12% on an organic basis as the trading environment remained muted across the globe. Adjusted operating expenses increased 22% to $192 million. And adjusted EBITDA of $293 million grew a solid 7% versus the second quarter of '22.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll provide some summary thoughts.\nThe performance of our Options segment was again very robust, delivering the highest growth of any segment for the quarter with net revenue increasing 20%. The results were driven by strong volumes in our index business and favorable revenue per contract or RPC trends, given the mix shift to index options.\nTotal options ADV was up 10% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 38% over 2Q '22 levels. RPC moved 16% higher, given the continued positive contribution of higher capture index products. And market data and access capacity fees were up 11% and 5%, respectively, as compared to 2Q '22.\nNorth American Equities net revenue was down 2% on a year-over-year basis. Results benefited from NEO, which was acquired in June of '22, contributing $3.6 million in inorganic net revenue during the quarter. In addition, access and capacity fees increased 6% as compared to 2Q '22, and market data increased 1% as proprietary market data growth outpaced the decline in [indiscernible] revenues.\nNet transaction fees were down 13%, given softer industry volumes and market share in our U.S. [indiscernible]. And while our U.S. on-exchange market share has trended lower on an absolute basis, our share has remained relatively constant when adjusting for the increase in off-exchange market volume and auction activity seen during the second quarter.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported a 5% year-over-year decline in net revenue impacted largely by softer industry volumes in Europe. The lower activity levels were partially offset by a nearly 1 percentage point increase in market share on a year-over-year basis. And Cboe Clear Europe also grew market share during the quarter from 31% to 34%.\nSecond quarter net revenue was down 1% in the Futures segment as a 3% decrease in net transaction fees was partially offset by an increase in [ access and ] capacity fees. Lower volumes were the primary driver of the decline in net transaction fees, falling 11% during the quarter. The decline of activity was partially offset by a 9% increase in RPC, helped by pricing tweaks we made in the VIX complex in April of this year. On the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees continue to perform well, up 6% versus the second quarter of last year.\nAnd finally, net revenue in the FX segment was up a solid 7% as compared to last year, marking the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year net revenue gains. Net transaction fees revenue was up 6% as average daily notional value increased by 7%, and market share hit another record at 19.5% for the quarter.\nTurning now to Cboe Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up a solid 9.4% in the second quarter, up 7.4% on an organic basis. Net revenue growth continued to be driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for 77% of organic access fee growth and 63% of organic market data growth in the second quarter.\nWe are pleased with the sequential acceleration in organic net revenue growth and remain confident in our ability to hit our full year guidance range of 7% to 10%. Over the second half of the year, we expect solid contributions from proprietary data sales benefiting from the sustained growth across our Derivatives complex. We also anticipate solid trends from Cboe Global Indices with good momentum around index licensing.\nIn Australia, we saw a solid uptick in data sales and access [indiscernible], in line with what we have witnessed following past technology migration. We expect that momentum to continue, adding to the enhanced distribution capabilities that Cboe Global Cloud presents, providing incremental sales potential for our suite of data products.\nWe also expect to make modest pricing increases in areas where our pricing has been consistent for many years but the utility being offered has increased dramatically. Following the selective enhancements, our products are expected to remain competitively priced relative to our peers, and we remain focused on the value proposition for our customers.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $192 million for the quarter, up 22% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 19% or $30 million for the quarter, largely reflecting higher headcount as compared to the second quarter of last year and increased travel and promotional spend, given our 50th anniversary celebration and increased corporate brand and marketing costs. And the second quarter also included a onetime $5 million true-up in June to reclassify certain capitalized charges to operating expenses in the technology support services line. Note that we do not expect any further adjustments for previously capitalized charges to impact our expense or capitalized charges moving forward.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are lowering our full year 2023 expense guidance range to $766 million to $774 million from $769 million to $779 million. The 3 basic components of the year-over-year increase are outlined on Slide 18 of our earnings presentation: expenses from 2022 acquisitions, growth investments and core expense growth.\nLooking at the details of our 3 categories, we expect the 2 2022 acquisitions to add approximately $30 million to $31 million in incremental expenses for '23, below our previously expected range of $33 million to $35 million as hiring slowed in our digital business, in part due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties. While we are still incredibly committed to the digital business, we continue to watch the regulatory landscape closely and adjust our spending to match the revenue environment.\nMoving on to growth-generating investments, we anticipate that the investments we are making in the business to help drive incremental revenue to our bottom line will be in the range of $25 million to $27 million. Our new range is roughly $3 million lower than our prior range, but we remain committed to investing in high-return areas like D&A expansion, a more aggressive marketing campaign and targeted products and services R&D efforts across our ecosystem.\nThe last component is our core expense growth, totaling approximately $59 million to $64 million. As a reminder, this includes our expectations for CAT project costs in '23, investments in infrastructure and inflationary factors on our business. Our updated estimates factor in an incremental $5 million for CAT expenses as well as the onetime reclassification of certain capitalized charges to operating expenses of $5 million. These higher charges were partially offset by lower expected depreciation and amortization expenses.\nMoving forward, we will continue to put capital to work in value-enhancing ways across our ecosystem while striving to strike the right balance between the revenue opportunity available and the expense outlay required to enhance value for shareholders.\nLooking at our full year guidance more broadly on the next slide, we are making some positive revisions to reflect our solid year-to-date performance and our constructive forward outlook across our businesses. At a high level, we are reaffirming our organic total net revenue growth range of 7% to 9% for 2023, but we now expect to finish at the higher end of the range for the year.\nThis remains above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 7% introduced at our Investor Day 1.5 years ago, a function of the meaningful engagement we have seen across the toolkit of products at Cboe. As mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our D&A organic net revenue growth rate of 7% to 10% for '23, in line with our medium-term expectations.\nGiven the company's positive mark on its investment in the 7RIDGE fund, which owns trading technologies, we now expect the other income benefit from minority investments to be in the range of $34 million to $40 million, up from our prior guidance calling for $27 million to $33 million.\nWe are lowering our full year guidance on depreciation and amortization to $40 million to $44 million from $48 million to $52 million. And we expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% in 2023, unchanged from our previous guidance.\nOutside of our annual guidance, net interest expense in the second quarter of '23 was $13.9 million. For 3Q, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $13 million.\nOn the capital front, our focus has been and remains maximizing long-term shareholder value through the effective use of our capital. In the second quarter, we returned a total of $61 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend and $8 million in the form of share repurchases.\nOur leverage ratio declined slightly to 1.4x from 1.5x in the prior quarter as we paid down $140 million on our term loan facility that matures in December of this year. We remain comfortable with our debt profile, having locked in low medium- to longer-term fixed rates averaging below 3% or nearly 90% of our total debt.\nIn summary, second quarter of '23 was another solid quarter at Cboe. I could not be more excited about the outlook for the company, and I look forward to delivering solid returns for shareholders in the quarters ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jill. As you can see, it has been a busy first half of the year. And I want to thank the entire Cboe team for their hard work and consistently delivering outstanding results. We head into the final half of the year on stronger footing than ever, and we look forward to continuing to execute on the growth opportunities ahead.\nI'll now pass it back to Ken for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\n[Operator Instructions]"

Tilly\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to recognize Cboe's 50th anniversary, which took place last week. It was a monumental milestone for the company, and I was excited to celebrate with our associates around the globe. Throughout our 50-year history, Cboe has been driven by a unique vision and an unwavering commitment to continually innovate to meet the evolving needs of the global financial industry. From pioneering options and volatility trading to introducing new technologies and market models, Cboe has transformed the way market participants transfer risk and build capital.\nOur series of strategic acquisitions in recent years have greatly expanded the breadth and depth of the Cboe network, making us the dynamic company that we are today. Each and every quarter, we have built upon our strong foundation, and this quarter is no different.\nI'm pleased to report on record first quarter earnings for Cboe, reflecting the continued endurance of our business. During the quarter, we grew net revenue by 13% year-over-year to a record $471 million and adjusted EPS by 10% to a record $1.90. These record-breaking first quarter results were driven by strong volumes across our Derivatives franchise, specifically our proprietary index option products and the continued global expansion of our Data and Access Solutions business.\nOur Derivatives business delivered another outstanding quarter as total net revenue increased 29% driven by the strength of our index options and volatility products and solid volumes in multi-list options trading. During the quarter, total net revenue in our Data and Access Solutions business increased 9%, while total net revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets business decreased 12%. We continue to make progress delivering on our top strategic growth priorities: Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and Cboe Digital. I'll touch on Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions in a moment.\nBut first, I want to provide an update on Cboe Digital. During the quarter, Cboe Digital continued to onboard new participants as liquidity deepened and our spreads compressed to competitive levels compared to other U.S.-based platforms.\nFebruary represented our best month to date with ADV of more than $100 million. We had a record first quarter with 7.4 billion traded.\n2023 is not only an anniversary year for Cboe, but it also marks the 40th anniversary of SPX options and the 30th anniversary of the VIX Index. The success of both our VIX franchise and suite of S&P 500 index option products is a result of years of innovation and perseverance driven by our unwavering belief in the potential from the beginning.\nTrading in these products was robust during the quarter. The recent enhancements implemented to expand access to SPX and XSP, including expanded trading hours and new expirations, have created new opportunities for customers.\nDuring the first quarter, SPX options ADV increased 59% to a record 2.8 million contracts, including a single day record of 4.2 million contracts traded on March 10. Building on the strong momentum we saw last quarter, our Mini SPX options contract, known by the ticker XSP, increased 195% year-over-year. Additionally, ADV for fixed options increased 18% year-over-year in the first quarter.\nIn both SPX and XSP, we continue to see many market participants opening and trading positions on the same day the options expire as they engage in tactical trading strategies around market events. ADV for SPX options opened on the same day of expiration, otherwise called 0DTE, comprised nearly 43% of overall SPX volumes in the first quarter and nearly 45% of SPX volume in April. We believe there has been a fundamental evolution in how customers are trading this product, and we anticipate this volume to continue.\nWe also continue to see increased demand from our non-U.S. customers and liquidity providers for the ability to trade SPX and VIX products across all time zones day and night. As a result, we have seen a sizable increase in volume during our global trading hour session with ADV for SPX and VIX options increasing 121% and 118%, respectively, year-over-year.\nTurning to our VIX products. ADV for fixed options increased 18% year-over-year to over 718,000 contracts traded in the first quarter while VIX futures ADV remained steady at 223,000 contracts. First quarter volume in multi-listed options increased 1% to an ADV of 11 million contracts. In March, Cboe reached a record 337 million total contracts traded across its 4 options exchanges.\n50 years ago, we founded the listed options industry. And despite its immense growth, we believe that we are still in the early stages of the evolution of this market. We continue to lead the industry forward through continued enhancements to our ecosystem of products to suit the needs of various customers.\nMost recently, we announced the launch of a Cboe 1-day volatility index. The market seeks to measure the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index over the current trading day. Just as the VIX Index has grown to become one of the most recognized tools in the marketplace, we believe that 1 day, VIX Index will be a complementary addition for market participants seeking to better understand current equity market volatility.\nDuring the quarter, we were also excited to announce our plans to expand the product suite of Cboe Europe Derivatives to include single stock options on leading European companies. These products are expected to be available for trading in November of 2023 and cleared by Cboe Clear Europe subject to necessary regulatory approvals.\nWith the utility and flexibility that options provide in any market environment as well as the varied trading strategies utilized by a diverse customer base, we believe we will continue to see demand from new and existing customers as they discover the benefits options can provide to their portfolios.\nWe are pleased with the continued solid growth of our Data and Access Solutions business, which posted another strong quarter with total net revenue increasing 9%. We continue to enhance our bundled data offerings and cloud strategy, packaging high-quality data from across our markets and [indiscernible] it to customers globally in a consistent and cost-effective manner, extending the reach of our content and the opportunity for this business.\nDuring the quarter, we were excited to launch the Cboe 1 [ options ], a product design for the retail options trading community. This high-quality data feed provides retail investors with cost-effective real-time data.\nCboe knows it is imperative to help equip the merchanting retail community with the information they may need to invest responsibly. Cboe's enduring success over the past half century is reflected in the unrivaled position that we hold today across our global derivatives and securities ecosystem. I've covered our Derivatives business and will now touch on highlights from our Cash and Spot Markets.\nIn our Global FX business, net revenues were up 8% year-over-year in the first quarter as the business expanded spot market share to a record 19% with average daily spot notional value traded of $45 billion. In Europe, the Cboe Europe Equities business increased first quarter market share 3 percentage points year-over-year to 24.9%.\nAdditionally, Cboe BIDS Europe had another strong quarter with 36.3% market share, extending its run as the largest European block trading venue for 12 consecutive months. Cboe Clear market share grew to 34.1% in the first quarter, up from 32.2% in the prior year quarter, making it the largest pan-European clearing venue.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. In March, we successfully completed our technology migration of Cboe Australia in partnership with customers and launched Cboe BIDS Australia, making our expansion of BIDS into the Asia Pacific market. We also welcomed [ Emma ] as the new President of Cboe Australia, and we cannot be more excited to have her leading our efforts in this key region.\nIn Japan, we saw our equities market share grow to 4.8% during the first quarter, up from 3.8% a year ago. We also remain on track for the Cboe Japan technology migration and expected launch of Cboe BIDS Japan in the fourth quarter of this year subject to regulatory approval, further extending our reach on the BIDS network into another key global equity market.\nIn summary, Cboe delivered an outstanding first quarter to start the year, continuing the momentum of our record 2022. While we have a long-term view of our business, we are committed to investing in the near term to lay a solid foundation for future sustainable growth. With this perspective, we are confident we can build on our success and continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders for the next 50 years.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Norman Schell\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed. As Ed highlighted, Cboe posted another record quarter to start 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was up 10% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1.90. The record revenue performance was again driven by the continued organic growth of our Derivatives franchise as well as a steady contribution from our Data and Access Solutions business.\n1Q was not only a period of robust financial performance, but it also marked a period of meaningful advancement for many of our strategic initiatives. We believe that striking the right balance between monetizing today's opportunities and investing in the future of our company is crucial for the long-term growth of Cboe.\nI want to quickly touch on some of the high-level takeaways from the first quarter before delving into the segment performance. Our first quarter net revenue increase of 13% set another quarterly record at $471 million led by the strength in our Derivatives markets category and the solid results from our Data and Access Solutions business.\nSpecifically, Derivatives markets produced 29% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the first quarter as the market continued to find increasing utility in our index options complex with the rise of 0DTE trading and global trading hours.\nData and Access Solutions net revenues increased 9%, up 6% on an organic basis during the quarter. We're pleased with the overall performance of the category and even more excited by the numerous catalysts we expect to accelerate growth over the course of this year.\nCash and Spot Markets net revenues decreased 12% during the quarter or 13% on an organic basis as we faced difficult industry volume comparisons versus the first quarter of '22 and a 3 percentage point impact from a stronger dollar. Adjusted operating expenses increased 28% to $186 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $310 million also notched a quarterly high, up 10% from the first quarter of '22.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments so I'll just provide summary thoughts.\nThe performance of our Options segment was again very strong, delivering the highest growth of any segment for the quarter with net revenue increasing 28%. Results were driven by robust volumes in our index business and strong revenue per contract or RPC, given the favorable mix shift trends.\nTotal options ADV was up 9% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 49% over 1Q '22 levels. RPC moved 27% higher given the continued positive contribution of index options and a stronger mix of higher-priced SPX options in our index business.\nAnd market data and access capacity [indiscernible] were up 8% and 9%, respectively, as compared to 1Q '22. One additional item worth calling out for the segment in the first quarter was the 51% year-over-year increase in options royalty fees, somewhat higher than previous quarterly growth rates. Roughly 75% of the increase was related to higher volumes in our SPX and VIX options. The remaining 25% of the increase was related to the last scheduled reset and royalty fees with S&P, which took effect at the beginning of the first quarter. This last scheduled adjustment to contract rates is part of our current agreement with S&P that runs through 2032, '33, making the first quarter a good run rate ratio of royalty fees to proprietary volume moving forward.\nNorth American Equities net revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis. Results benefited from NEO, which was acquired in June of '22, contributing $5.6 million in net revenue during the quarter.\nIn addition, access and capacity fees increased 9% as compared to 1Q '22, while market data declined 7% on the back of lower SIP revenue. Net transaction fees were flat, given softer industry volumes and market share in our U.S. businesses. And while our U.S. on-exchange market share has trended lower on an absolute basis, our share has remained relatively constant when adjusting for the increase in off-exchange market volume activity seen during 1Q.\nThe industry volume and market share headwinds were offset by the positive contribution from the NEO acquisition during the quarter. The Europe and APAC segment reported a 14% year-over-year decline in net revenue. However, adjusting for a $3.5 million FX impact given the stronger dollar during the quarter, net revenue fell by a more modest 8% on a constant currency basis, impacted by softer volumes in Europe.\nThe lower activity levels were partially offset by a 3.1 percentage point increase in market share on a year-over-year basis, making Cboe Europe the largest stock exchange in Europe again. And Cboe Clear Europe also grew market share during the quarter from 32% to 34%.\nFirst quarter net revenue was flat in the future segment as a 4% decline in net transaction fees was offset by an increase in access and capacity fees. Lower volumes were the primary driver of the decline in net transaction fees, falling 9% during the quarter.\nNontransaction revenues continued to perform well with access and capacity fees up 18% and market data flat to the first quarter of last year. And finally, net revenue in the FX segment was up 8% compared to last year, building on the very strong momentum we saw from the FX segment during '22. Net transaction fee revenue was up 8% as average daily notional value increased by 7% and market share hit another record at 19% for the quarter.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Net revenues were up a solid 9% in the first quarter, up 6.2% on an organic basis. Net revenue growth continued to be driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for 70% of access fee and market data growth in the first quarter.\nWhile our 6.2% organic net revenue growth rate for the quarter finished slightly below the low end of our 7% to 10% full year guidance range, we feel confident in our ability to accelerate trends over the back half of the year. Specifically, with the recent launch of Cboe One options, we expect to see an uptake of clients for all of our Cboe One data fees in the second half of Q3, adding incremental revenue for the D&A business.\nIn Australia, we finished our successful technology migration and launched our BIDS offering in the region at the end of the first quarter. Following the migration, we expect to see increased demand for Cboe data in Australia, consistent with what we have seen following past technology migrations around the globe.\nAnd to that positive momentum is the enhanced distribution that Cboe Global Cloud now provides, offering incremental sales potential for our suite of data products. We also anticipate solid trends from Cboe Global Indices with good momentum around index licensing. We are experiencing new global customer wins in risk and market analytics and see opportunities coming online in distribution.\nFrom a timing perspective, we anticipate most of this acceleration will occur in the second half of '23, landing us in our 7% to 10% organic net revenue growth guidance range for the full year and putting us in line with our medium-term expectations outlined at our November 2021 Investor Day.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $186 million for the quarter, up 28% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 19% or $28 million for the quarter, largely reflecting higher headcount as compared to the first quarter of last year as well as some inflationary comp adjustments and higher professional fees and outside services as compared to 1Q '22.\nMoving to our expense guidance, we are reaffirming our full year '23 expense guidance range of $769 million to $779 million. This compares to our 2022 expense base of $652 million.\nThe 3 basic components of the year-over-year increase are outlined on Slide 17 of our earnings presentation: expenses from 2022 acquisitions, growth investments and core expense growth. At a high level, while the aggregate expense range remains unchanged, we expect a $3 million reduction in expenses from 2022 acquisitions to be entirely offset by higher anticipated consolidated audit trail or CAT project expenses, costs that we have limited control over.\nLooking at the details of our 3 expense categories, we anticipate that 2022 acquisitions of NEO and ErisX will add approximately $33 million to $35 million in incremental expenses in '23. We are again calling out growth-generating investments, given the numerous attractive opportunities we see today. These are investments we are making today to help drive incremental revenue to our bottom line in future years.\nSpecifically, we are investing in global listings, D&A expansion and more aggressive marketing campaign and targeted products and services R&D efforts across our ecosystem. In 2023, we continue to expect growth investments to be in the range of $28 million to $30 million.\nThe last component and the largest portion of the year-over-year increase remains our core expense growth totaling approximately $56 million to $62 million. Our new range is $3 million higher than last quarter, given the increased expectations for CAT project costs in '23, while our outlook for investments in infrastructure and inflationary factors remains unchanged.\nWe will continue to exhibit operational efficiency while investing where we see opportunities overtime. We believe the investments we are making today position Cboe well to generate attractive returns in the years ahead.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance. On the next slide, we are reaffirming the '23 guidance we introduced last quarter. In addition to the previously noted D&A organic net revenue growth rate of 7% to 10% range for '23, we expect acquisitions held less than a year to contribute around 0.5 percentage point to total net revenue growth in '23.\nAnd we are reaffirming our organic total revenue growth range of 7% to 9% for '23. This remains above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 7% introduced at our Investor Day 1.5 years ago, a function of our confidence in the durable growth of our business and the progress we are seeing behind the investments we have made to increase the access and distribution of our products and markets globally.\nLast quarter, we introduced guidance calling for an expected contribution of $27 million to $33 million in '23 for minority investments benefiting our other income line. In 1Q, we recognized a $14 million gain on the company's investment in 7RIDGE fund, which owns trading technologies and are reaffirming our full year expectation of a $27 million to $33 million benefit. We look for the impact of minority investments to become a regular and recurring contributor to company earnings and are providing our best estimate of the benefit we anticipate in '23.\nWe are also reaffirming our full year guidance on depreciation and amortization of $48 million to $52 million and expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings and the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% in 2023.\nOutside of our annual guidance, net interest expense for the first quarter of '23 was $15.1 million. For 2Q, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million.\nOn the capital front, our focus has been and remains maximizing shareholder value through effective use of our capital. In the first quarter, we returned a total of $123 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend and $70 million in the form of share repurchases.\nOverall, we remain well positioned to invest in the business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares when we believe our stock price do not adequately reflect the underlying fundamentals of our business as we did in the first quarter. We have $148 million of remaining capacity on our share repurchase authorization as of April 30, 2023.\nOur leverage ratio for the quarter remained at 1.5x, in line with fourth quarter levels. We remain comfortable with our debt profile, having locked in low medium- to longer-term fixed rates averaging below 3% on over 80% of our total debt.\nIn summary, the first quarter of '23 was an excellent start to the year. We look forward to building on our record results through thoughtful investments behind the numerous growth initiatives we have, generating durable returns for shareholders in many quarters and years to come.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. In closing, I want to thank our valued customers who engage with us every day, providing liquidity to our markets, utilizing our products and services and supporting our vision. They are valued partners that have been critical to our success over the last 50 years.\nI'm extremely proud of our people, past and present, who helped build an incredible company and continue to chart the future success for Cboe. Our 50-year legacy is built on trust, relentless innovation and a drive to disrupt the status quo, powered by the exceptional strength of our people. Together, we have created an exchange like no other, the exchange for the world stage.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on record fourth quarter and full year results for Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we grew net revenue 17% year-over-year to a record $457 million and adjusted diluted EPS by 6% to a record $1.80. These results capped a record year. We saw us grow net revenue 18% to a record $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS 15% to a record $6.93.\nOur outstanding results were driven by strong volumes across our global network led by Derivatives complex and continued growth in our Data and Access Solutions business. Our Derivatives business delivered another outstanding quarter driven by robust performance in our index options franchise, where average daily volume increased 55% year-over-year while multi-list options trading increased 6% year-over-year to an ADV of 11.2 million contracts.\nWe saw record volume across our suite of S&P 500 Index options products with fourth quarter ADV and SPX contract increasing 73% year-over-year to 2.7 million contracts. Our Mini-SPX options contract, known by the ticker XSP and 1/10 the size of the SPX options contract, increased 188% year-over-year to an ADV of nearly 66,000 contracts. Additionally, ADV for VIX options increased 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the quarter, net revenue in our Cash and Spot Markets business decreased 5% while we saw a 13% increase in net revenue for our Data and Access Solutions business, including strong organic net revenue growth of 10% year-over-year. We continue to execute on the transformational opportunities we saw in our business: Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and Cboe Digital. I'll touch on Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions at a moment, but first, I want to provide an update on Cboe Digital.\nIn November, we completed the syndication of minority equity interest with a group of 13 firms announced as investor partners in the Cboe Digital business. Our investor partners include many of the most sophisticated and active participants in fiat and digital asset markets globally and contribute to the momentum of the franchise.\nWe are actively onboarding these partners to the Cboe Digital platform and look forward to working together to bring trust and transparency to the digital asset marketplace. Now more than ever, we believe the experience that established market operators provide with the benefits of their regulated framework is critical to helping enable the opportunities afforded by this asset class. With the onboarding of new participants and marketplace evolution, we have seen continued volume increase in industry-leading spreads in Cboe Digital to start the year, with January average daily notional value topping a record $71 million.\nOur Derivatives business delivered strong results as we continue to expand access to our unique products to customers around the globe leveraging our extended distribution network. For the year, a record 558.4 million SPX contracts were traded with an ADV of 2.2 million contracts, a 63% increase year-over-year.\nWe continue to see increased demand from our non-U.S. customers and liquidity providers for the ability to trade or hedge broad U.S. market and global equity volatility conveniently across all time zones day and night. As a result, we have seen a sizable increase in SPX volume during our global trading hour session with ADV increasing 216% year-over-year during the fourth quarter to nearly 55,000 contracts, capping off a record year for global trading hours with total volumes up 3x over the 2021 levels. This year is off to an even stronger start as January volumes ran approximately 55% above 2022 levels.\nIn December, we also added XSP to our global trading hour session, enabling customers to trade this product nearly 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and providing the ability to adjust positions around the clock with even greater precision and flexibility. With the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations late last year for XSP, both SPX and XSP now offer options that expire every weekday.\nWe continue to see increased demand for same-day trading in SPX with many market participants opening and trading positions on the same day the options expire as they engage in tactical trading strategies around market events. ADV for SPX options open on the same day of expiration increased 83% throughout 2022 and comprised over 43% of overall SPX volumes in the fourth quarter.\nWith the utility and flexibility that options provide in any market environment as well as the varied trading strategies utilized by a diverse customer base, we believe we will continue to see sustained momentum in options trading as customers continue to tap the benefits this product offers.\nTurning to the VIX products. ADV and VIX options increased 7% year-over-year to over 550,000 contracts traded in the fourth quarter. During global trading hours, we saw VIX options volumes increase with ADV up 72% year-over-year in the quarter, and we have seen strong momentum to start the year as January volumes ran 56% above 2022 levels.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business posted strong results during the fourth quarter with the integration of our recent acquisitions continuing to fuel the durability of this business. Through our bundled debt offerings and cloud strategy, we were able to package high-quality data from across our markets and deliver to customers globally in a consistent and cost-effective manner, extending the reach of our content and opportunity for this business.\nAdditionally, we continue to see strong customer uptake of Cboe Global Cloud, a real-time data streaming service to provide simple, efficient access to Cboe's robust suite of market data. We now have 25 customers connected to the service with 52% of revenue coming from the Asia Pacific region and 38% from Europe. Additionally, many customers are subscribing to multiple data products offered via Cboe Global Cloud. This diverse customer base reaffirms that our strategy of providing simple, efficient access to our market data is resonating with customers who want access to a global set of market data through a single unified service.\nAdditionally, we have seen solid customer adoption of the Cboe One Canada Feed, a real-time market data feed that provides a comprehensive view of Canadian equities market data since launching last fall. As we integrate Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan post technology migration, we look forward to further expanding our portfolio of market data solutions globally. Through product innovation, thoughtful integration and superior customer service, we continue to expand our ecosystem as we build one of the world's largest and most comprehensive derivatives and securities networks.\nIn our Global FX business, net revenues were up 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as the business expanded spot market share to a record 18.4% with average daily spot notional value traded of nearly $41 billion. Our nondeliverable forward volumes on Cboe SEF also grew significantly with annual ADNV of $836 million last year compared with $406 million in 2021.\nIn Europe, the Cboe Europe Equities business continued to perform exceptionally well with overall market share reaching 24.9% in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased adoption of our services in Europe, it was our lit order books that predominantly drove our market share gains with lit-only market share rising from 21.9% at the start of the year to 27.3% in December 2022.\nAdditionally, Cboe BIDS Europe remains the largest block trading platform during the fourth quarter with 34.5% market share of the European block trading market. At the end of 2022, the BIDS Europe platform had over 600 active traders across 243 buy-side firms and 28 sell-side participants. And we expect to have a strong pipeline of new firms this year. The strong foundation of participants utilizing Cboe BIDS Europe will create opportunities as we continue to expand the Cboe BIDS network around the globe.\nMoving to North America. The power of the BIDS network helped propel Cboe BIDS Canada to another record quarter with 65 million shares traded. Overall equities market share in Canada grew to 13.6% in the fourth quarter while U.S. equities market share was 13.1%.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. Cboe Australia market share grew to 17.2% in the fourth quarter, up from 16.1% in the previous year. We remain on track to extend the BIDS network to the region with the launch of Cboe BIDS Australia this month. Our experience bringing BIDS into new markets globally, including Europe and Canada, has enabled us to perfect our approach, and we are very excited about the demand we have seen from local participants for this distinctive block trading platform.\nWe also remain on track to launch Cboe BIDS Japan in the fourth quarter of this year, further extending our reach of the BIDS network into another key global equity market. Additionally, in Japan, we saw our equities market share grow to 3.6% during 2022, up from 2.7% in 2021.\nWe continue to be in full integration mode since announcing our last acquisition more than 14 months ago. As mentioned, subject to regulatory approvals, we plan to migrate Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan to Cboe technology this year with the Australian migration happening later this month alongside the launch of Cboe BIDS Australia.\nWe've been working with our customers closely over the last year in preparation for the migrations. And look forward to the benefits of bringing both of these critical markets on to our technology, creating a seamless and consistent experience for customers and unlocking value for our global market participants.\nWe have also continued to make solid progress enhancing the framework of our global listings business since welcoming NEO, a Canadian exchange, last year. Our goal is to provide issuers with access to an integrated and global network of capital formation and secondary liquidity while working to harmonize our processes and create efficiencies for our customers around the globe. Building on our strong foundation as the second largest ETP listings venue in the U.S., we are enthusiastic about both the near- and long-term opportunities to grow and expand our listing business globally and believe we have the momentum as we kick off 2023.\nWe are excited by the many growth opportunities we see across our ecosystem today. Brian will do a deeper dive on this in a moment, but this excitement is fueling our attractive 2023 revenue growth targets. Specifically, we anticipate total organic net revenues will increase in the range of 7% to 9% in 2023, above our medium-term guidance range of 5% to 7%. We anticipate that our Data and Access Solutions organic net revenues will grow at a robust 7% to 10% in the year ahead.\nWhile we expect to invest behind the meaningful opportunities we see in the market today, we expect that the investments we make this year will help position Cboe to grow in 2023 and beyond.\nI'll turn it over to Brian to share more.\n\nBrian Norman Schell\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Interim Chief HR Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good day to all of you. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q '22 as compared to 4Q '21 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.\nAs Ed highlighted, Cboe posted another incredibly strong quarter to cap off a record year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was up 6% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1.80. The strong performance was again characterized by the continued growth of our Derivatives franchise as well as a steady contribution from our Data and Access Solutions business.\nOver the course of the year, we made meaningful progress advancing our numerous initiatives, plans that span multiple asset classes and geographies. We see these investments as driving growth in Cboe as reflected in our 2022 record results and in the healthy forward outlook we have for our businesses.\nI want to quickly touch on some of the high-level takeaways from the fourth quarter before delving into the segment performance. Our fourth quarter net revenue increased 17%, setting another quarterly record at $457 million led by the strength in our Derivatives markets category and robust results from our Data and Access Solutions business. Specifically, Derivatives markets produced 33% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the fourth quarter as innovations like Tuesday, Thursday expirations continue to resonate with customers and fuel same-day trading in our SPX complex.\nData and Access Solutions net revenues increased 13%, up 10% on an organic basis, finishing a very strong year where DnA organic revenue increased by a very healthy 12%. Cash and Spot Markets net revenues decreased 5% during the quarter or 7% on an organic basis.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 28% to $177 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $292 million also notched a quarterly high, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2021. And as noted previously, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $1.80, up 6% compared to last year's quarterly results.\nTurning to key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts.\nOur Options segment was a standout for the quarter, again delivering the strongest growth with net revenue increasing 35%. Results were driven by robust volumes in our index business and stronger revenue per contract, given the favorable mix shift trends.\nTotal options ADV was up 15% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 55% over 4Q '21 levels. RPC moved 25% higher, given a continued positive mix shift to index products and a stronger mix of higher-priced SPX options in our index business. And lastly, we continue to benefit from another quarter of double-digit growth in market data and access and capacity fees, up 34% and 15%, respectively, as compared to 4Q '21.\nNorth American Equities net revenue increased by 5% year-over-year. Results benefited from NEO, which was acquired in June of '22, contributing $5.5 million in net revenue during the quarter. In addition, access capacity fees increased 10% as compared to 4Q '21, and market data was up 4%. Net transaction fees fell by 4%, given a mixed volume environment across our businesses, softer market share and capture rates.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported a year-over-year decline in net revenue for the fourth quarter of 15%. However, adjusting for a $5.6 million FX impact given the stronger dollar during the quarter, net revenue fell by a more modest 4% on a constant currency basis, impacted by softer industry volumes in Europe. The lower activity levels were partially offset by a 5.1 percentage point increase in market share on a year-over-year basis, making Cboe Europe the largest stock exchange in Europe again for the quarter.\nFourth quarter net revenue decreased 10% in the Futures segment as transaction fees declined 15% on a year-over-year basis. Lower volumes were the primary driver of the decline, falling 16% in the fourth quarter '22 as compared to fourth quarter of '21. Nontransaction revenues continued to tick higher with access capacity fees up 2% and market data up 25% as compared to 4Q '21.\nAnd finally, net revenues in the FX segment were up a strong 14% as compared to 4Q '21, capping a very strong year for FX, where net revenues grew an impressive 18%. Net transaction and clearing fees in the fourth quarter benefited from a 21% increase in average daily notional value and higher levels of market share, hitting another quarterly record of 18.4%.\nTurning now to Cboe's Data and Access Solutions business. Organic net revenues were up an impressive 12% for the full year. Net revenues were up 13% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, up 10% on an organic basis. As we have seen in past quarters, net revenue growth continues to be driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for over 90% of access fee growth and 58% of market data growth.\nIn our Data and Access businesses, we saw robust physical and logical port usage in our Options and Equities businesses driven by increased demand for trading capacity. And on the market data side, the Equities top of book and Options depth of book products continued to perform well. Cboe Global Indices Feed also benefited from some pricing enhancements during the quarter. In 2023, we anticipate that trends will remain resilient as we are forecasting 7% to 10% organic net revenue growth for Data and Access Solutions, in line with our medium-term guidance range outlined at our November 2021 Investor Day.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $177 million for the quarter, up 28% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 21% or $28 million for the quarter, largely reflecting higher headcount as compared to fourth quarter of last year as well as some inflationary comp adjustments and additional incentive compensation in 4Q '22.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are introducing a full year 2023 expense guidance range of $779 million. This compares to our 2022 expense base of $652 million. There are 3 basic components to the year-over-year increase outlined on Slide 17 of our earnings presentation that I want to walk through in detail, namely expenses from 2022 acquisitions, revenue-enhancing investments we are making in our business and core expense growth.\nThe first component is the normalization for the 2 transactions ErisX and NEO we completed in 2022. We anticipate these deals will add approximately $36 million to $38 million in incremental expenses in 2023.\nIn our expense base, we are again calling out growth-generating investments we are making, given the numerous attractive growth opportunities we see today. These are costs we expect to drive incremental revenue to our bottom line, furthering the robust growth trends we have enjoyed over the past few years. Specifically, we are investing in global listings, DNA expansion, a more aggressive marketing campaign given our 50-year anniversary as a company and targeted R&D efforts across our ecosystem. In 2023, we expect revenue-enhancing investments to be in the range of $28 million to $30 million accounting for roughly 4.5 percentage points of our 2023 adjusted expense growth.\nThe last component and the largest portion of the year-over-year increase is our core expense growth, approximately $53 million to $59 million or 8% to 9% of our expense increase in 2023. I think it's important to understand the moving pieces within our core expense base.\nFirst, we continue to invest in the infrastructure of our business. As we strengthen our footprint as a multi-asset class global exchange and services provider, we will continue to invest behind a robust technology offering to deliver a best-in-class client experience. Roughly 2% of our expense growth in '22 was related to core infrastructure. And we would expect a similar contribution this year as we continue to build a cohesive offering around the globe. Facilitating the expanded capacity, access and distribution of our products and services globally is important to our success, and we will continue to ensure Cboe can meet the needs of our clients.\nUnrelated to our infrastructure spend is an incremental 2 percentage points of expense growth we are attributing to the consolidated audit trail or CAT project. These costs, which we have limited direct control over, are expected to add an incremental $10 million to $15 million to our 2023 expense base, based on our initial estimates.\nThe remaining core piece is related to our day-to-day cost of doing business. In '22, we talked about some inflationary pressures impacting these expenses. And while we do still feel some of those pressures today, we expect core day-to-day expenses to be up a modest 4% in '23, down from the 7% growth we saw in '22.\nCboe has enjoyed some of the most consistent and most durable revenue growth, operating margins and earnings generation in the industry. The expense forecast we are providing today highlights the continued investment we are making to sustain those trends moving forward. To state this more directly, it is because of the investments we have made in our business that we generated record '22 results and are able to guide to a robust 7 to 9 percentage point increase in organic total net revenue in the year ahead. We believe that the investments we make in '23 will position us well to generate attractive return for years to come.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. I want to call out some highlights for '23 following our record net revenue results in '22. For Data and Access Solutions, we expect net revenue growth to be in the 7% to 10% range for '23, in line with the medium-term guidance of 7% to 10% we introduced at our Investor Day a little more than a year ago.\nWe expect acquisitions held less than a year to contribute around 0.5 percentage point to total net revenue growth in '23. Most importantly, we are guiding our organic total net revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% for 2023. This is above our medium-term guidance of 5% to 7% introduced at our Investor Day a little more than a year ago, a function of our confidence in the durable growth of our business and the progress we are seeing behind the investments we have made to increase the access and distribution of our products in markets globally.\nDuring this year, we are introducing an expected contribution of $27 million to $33 million for minority investments benefiting our other income line. Cboe has made and will look to continue to make investments in businesses that align with our strategic vision.\nOur 4Q '21 investment in 7RIDGE with Cboe becoming a limited partner in the acquisition of Trading Technologies is a great example of how we plan to utilize our network of partners to invest in strategic assets. We look for the impact of these investments to become a more regular contributor to company earnings and are providing our best estimate of the benefits we anticipate in '23.\nWe are introducing full year guidance on depreciation and amortization of $48 million to $52 million and expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws to come in at 28.5% to 30.5% in '23. Outside of our annual guidance, interest expense for the fourth quarter of '22 was $15.7 million. Moving forward, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $14.5 million to $15.5 million for 1Q '23.\nOn the capital front, our focus has been and remains maximizing shareholder value through the effective use of our capital. In the fourth quarter, we returned a total of $53 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend and $15 million in the form of share repurchases. Year-to-date '23, we've also repurchased $30 million of our shares. We remain well positioned to invest in the business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares with $188 million in remaining capacity on our share repurchases authorization as of January 31, 2023.\nOur leverage ratio decreased to 1.5x at the end of the fourth quarter, down from 1.7x at September 30 and from 1.9x from June 30, reflecting our significant growth in earnings as well as the repayment of $120 million of our term loan facility in 4Q '22. And through prudent debt capital markets transactions, we have also locked in low medium- to longer-term fixed rates averaging below 3% on over 80% of our total debt.\nOverall, we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet and striving to put capital to work in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders. Given where we are today in our capital structure, we plan to shift slightly to prioritize opportunistic share repurchases over further debt paydown, given our leverage ratio at 1.5x at the end of 4Q '22.\nIn summary, 2022 was a tremendous year of record revenue generation and earnings growth. We expect that momentum to continue, fueled by the attractive investments we are making across our ecosystem. We are incredibly pleased with the start to '23 and look forward to delivering attractive returns to our shareholders in the quarters ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. In summary, Cboe delivered a very strong fourth quarter to close the year. And 2022's record results give us increased confidence that if we continue to invest in high-value growth initiatives that further expand the Cboe ecosystem, we can continue to deliver strong long-term results for our investors.\nI'm also proud of the work we did to advance our corporate ESG initiatives in 2022. We will continue to look for opportunities to support our communities and associates while driving for a more sustainable future.\nI would like to thank our team for the incredible results achieved during the fourth quarter to cap off a fantastic year. As we enter our 50th year of business, we are more optimistic than ever about the future. Our history of innovation, client service and good citizenship will be the foundation for building trusted markets for the next 50 years. I am extremely proud to lead this incredible team and organization as we continue to push Cboe to new heights.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Kenneth Hill. Mr. Hill, please go ahead.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call.

During the call this morning, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on an outstanding third quarter at Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting revenue results, growing net revenue 20% year-over-year to a record $442 million, and growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 20% to a record $1.74. These record results were driven by strong volumes across our Derivatives franchise, solid growth in our Data and Access Solutions business and increased trading activity in our Cash Equities businesses.\nOur Derivatives business delivered another strong quarter, driven by robust performance in our index options franchise, specifically SPX options, as well as a solid increase in multi-listed options. Record activity across our SPX complex helped drive a 67% year-over-year increase in average daily volume in the SPX contract for the quarter.\nThe third quarter ADV reaching [2.4] million contracts, up from 1.4 million contracts 1 year ago. ADV for VIX options increased 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, and growth accelerated to start the fourth quarter with October ADV finishing 27% above third quarter levels. Multi-listed options trading on Cboe increased 8% year-over-year to an ADV of 10.6 million contracts.\nOur cash and spot markets business was solid during the third quarter, with net revenue increasing 5%, including organic net revenue growth of 3% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, our Data and Access Solutions business posted strong results with the integration of our recent acquisitions continuing to fuel the durability of this business. Year-over-year, net revenue increased 15% with 12% organic net revenue growth.\nWe remain focused on the significant opportunities we see in 3 core areas of our business: Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and Cboe Digital. We fuel these opportunities by executing against our ongoing strategy which remains consistent: leverage our superior technology, further strengthen our core proprietary products, increase recurring revenue and expand our product line by geography and asset class.\nI'll touch on Derivatives and Data and Access Solutions in a moment, but first, I wanted to provide an update on Cboe Digital. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the initial group [of firms that] intend to become equity investors in the Cboe Digital business, which includes a diverse range of market participants.\nWe have finalized the material investment terms and anticipate closing partner syndication very soon. We are actively onboarding partners to the Cboe Digital platform, and we look forward to leveraging the combined expertise of these firms to help accelerate Cboe's vision of a transparent and well-regulated digital asset marketplace for participants across the globe.\nLast week, we signed a memorandum of understanding with SBI Holdings, a pioneer of Internet financial services and the largest online brokerage in Japan, laying the foundation for potential collaboration in the areas of traditional and digital finance. The MoU creates the opportunity for Cboe and its Japanese equities market, Cboe Japan, to work together with SBI to leverage the expertise of respective companies in mutually beneficial ways to extend the reach of our products, services and customer bases.\nAlso, we see a wide range of potential opportunities to work with SBI on the development of an institutional digital asset infrastructure. SBI has established a global leadership position in this area through its affiliate, SBI Digital Asset Holdings.\nWe saw positive momentum in our Derivatives business as we continue to innovate and expand access to our core product suite. The enhancements we have recently made, including the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX and SPX options, known by the ticker XSP and 1/10 the size of the standard SPX options contract, continue to reshape trading behavior and expand the overall market.\nTwo weeks ago, we hosted our Global Risk Management Conference, where traders, investors strategists and academics from around the world gathered to discuss the challenges and opportunities for managing risk in the current dynamic market environment. It was fantastic to hear from industry participants how they are navigating today's markets amid a backdrop of rising inflation, interest rates and geopolitical tensions.\nOne of the key themes discussed at the conference was the increased usage of shorter-dated options. The strong volume in SPX options activity I noted earlier was driven by trading in our short-dated SPX Weeklys options as investors navigated rapidly changing market conditions. We've also seen volumes in Mini-SPX increased by over 50% since adding Tuesday and Thursday expirations last month.\nAdditionally, we've seen a surge in users opening and trading positions on the same day as contract expiry. These zero days to expiration contracts have become the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. Options business. Adding Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX and Mini-SPX has enabled market participants to trade zero days to expiration contracts any day of the week. Volume in zero days to expiration options has increased steadily month-over-month this year, reaching a record ADV of 1.2 million contracts in September, which represented over 44% of total SPX options volume.\nWith our diverse index options product suite, we are well positioned as investors of all shapes and sizes to continue to embrace shorter-duration trading strategies as they navigate this volatile market environment. Given our global footprint, we're continually looking for ways to increase access to our proprietary suite of products in every region.\nOur efforts to expand trading hours in SPX and VIX options to 24 hours a day, 5 days a week have translated to greater client adoption and incremental volumes. In the third quarter, ADV and global trading hours for SPX options increased 219% year-over-year, and VIX options increased 71%.\nThose trends have further accelerated in October, with global trading hours ADV up 63% in SPX options and 36% in VIX options as compared to third quarter levels. Next month, we plan to extend trading in many SPX options to encompass global trading hours, enabling global market participants to have access to this unique product, whose smaller contract size allows for greater accessibility and flexibility.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business continued to perform exceptionally well, and we have strong conviction in this business going forward as we plan to further unlock revenue opportunities created through the integration of our recent acquisitions.\nTo that point, in September, we launched the Cboe One Canada Feed, our new real-time market data feed that combines NEO and MATCHNow data to provide a comprehensive view into the Canadian equities market, further expanding our portfolio of market data solutions globally. Additionally, we are focused on uniquely packaging and delivering data to meet the needs of our diverse customer base.\nLast month, we added pan-European equities market data to Cboe Global Cloud, a real-time data streaming service that provides simple, efficient access to Cboe's robust suite of market data. Through our bundled data offerings and cloud strategy, we are able to package high-quality data from across our markets and deliver it to customers globally in a consistent and cost-effective manner, extending the reach of our content and the durability of our Data and Access Solutions business.\nIn each region we operate, we continue to expand our footprint and unique product set, enable us to meet the needs of increasing diverse set of customers around the world. In Europe, Cboe Europe Equities delivered its highest quarterly market share in nearly 7 years, reaching 24.6% for the third quarter, making it Europe's largest stock exchange for the quarter.\nOur analytics-driven campaign in the region continues to encourage additional order flow to our exchange and extend our leadership position, with overall October market share nearly 200 basis points from the third quarter levels to an all-time high of 26.5%. Additionally, Cboe BIDS Europe remained the largest block trading platform during the third quarter, reaching a record 35% market share of the European block trading market.\nMoving to Asia Pacific. Cboe Japan market share increased to 4.4%, up from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2021, driven by existing retail partners in Japan, including Rakuten, as well as new liquidity provider program introduced earlier this year. These efforts in Japan are an early demonstration of our commitment to bringing healthy competition to the vital Japanese market.\nIn Australia, market share grew to 16.7%, up from 15.7% year-over-year, and we are on track to migrate Cboe Australia to our proprietary technology in February 2023 as well as extend the BIDS network to the region with the launch of Cboe BIDS Australia, both subject to final regulatory review and approval.\nTurning to North America. The power of the BIDS network propelled Cboe BIDS Canada to a record quarter with 59 million shares traded. With the addition of NEO, our overall equities market share in Canada grew to 12.2%. We remain focused on our integration plan to help us maximize the outstanding potential we see for our global equities and listing businesses.\nDuring the quarter, we conducted our first coordinated launch of ETFs on both sides of the border with the listing of the Emerge ETFs on our Canadian and U.S. stock exchanges. This dual listing was the first step towards realizing our vision to become an unparalleled global listings network that creates connections across borders and provides new capital formation and investment opportunities for capital raisers and investors around the world. These listings added to the strength of our ETP listings business, where we remained the second largest ETP listing venue in the U.S. as of quarter end.\nFinally, our Global FX business saw strong volumes as monetary policy divergence rattled markets, with average daily notional volume topping $40 billion during the quarter, with record spot market share of 17.8%. We saw our full amount offering, which provides clients with a solution for larger order risk transference with low market impact, increased 24% year-over-year to reach new record of 12.3 billion average daily notional volume in the third quarter.\nOur NDF offering also saw record volumes, increasing 102% year-over-year to 953 million ADNV. With our diverse product set within FX, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the FX business. These efforts to expand our footprint through an on-the-ground global presence also serve the growth of our global flagship derivatives and DNA products, which are accessible around the world and around the clock.\nImportantly, while achieving strong results, we continue to successfully execute on key initiatives to advance our corporate strategy to innovate, integrate and grow our business globally. Our strength lies in our ability to successfully combine strategic acquisitions with organic growth initiatives. We remain laser focused on the seamless integration of our recent acquisitions and are making excellent progress around the globe.\nAs I've stated before, we approach the integration of technology and teams holistically, avoiding silos while maximizing synergies, both revenue and cost. This approach creates workflow efficiencies for customers, harmonizing technology and access points, creating a better experience for them.\nThe last several years have been very exciting as we've evolved our business, broadened our geographic reach and extended access to our unique set of products and services around the globe. Our global presence gives us the unmatched ability to efficiently scale and expand our business in new ways. We remain focused on creating a healthy ecosystem of products and services that create short, medium and long-term opportunities, helping to enable a cadence of consistent growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Norman Schell\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Interim Chief HR Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good day to all of you. Let me remind everyone that, unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 3Q '22 as compared to 3Q '21 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.\nAs Ed highlighted, Cboe posted an exceptionally strong third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 20% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1.74. The quarter was characterized by the outside contribution from our Derivatives franchise, but our Data and Access Solutions results were strong. And Cash and Spot Markets performed solidly for the quarter, each playing a notable role in our record net revenue results.\nThe supportive macro environment also provided us the opportunity to advance many of our initiatives across geographies and asset classes, some having an immediate impact in the quarter. And others, we expect to make measured progress against over the medium and longer term. I want to quickly touch on some of the high-level takeaways from the third quarter before delving into the segment performance.\nOur net revenue increase of 20% set another quarterly record at $442 million, led by the strength in our Derivatives markets category and steady performance in Data and Access Solutions and Cash and Spot Markets. Specifically, Derivatives Markets produced 31% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the third quarter, given the continued strength of our index business.\nData and Access Solutions net revenues were up 15%, up 12% on an organic basis, driven again by strong new subscription and unit growth. And Cash and Spot Markets produced 5% net revenue growth for the quarter, up 3% on an organic basis on the back of a strong macro backdrop and market share gains in many of our businesses.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 23% to $173 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $287 million, also another quarterly high, was up 20%. And last, as noted previously, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $1.74, up 20% compared to last year's quarterly results.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts.\nAs mentioned earlier, we saw impressive year-over-year growth in many of our segments during the quarter. Options again delivered the strongest growth, with net revenue increasing 33%. The results were driven by robust volumes, increased market share and higher revenue per contract, or RPC, given the favorable mix shift trends.\nTotal options ADV was up 15% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 49% over 3Q '21 levels. RPC moved 21% higher, given a continued positive mix shift to index products and a stronger mix of higher-priced SPX options in our index business. And lastly, we continue to benefit from another quarter of double-digit growth in market data and access and capacity fees, up 26% and 25%, respectively, as compared to 3Q '21.\nNorth American equities net revenue increased by 13% year-over-year. Solid industry volumes, up 12% as compared to 3Q '21, helped drive the segment uptick. NEO, which was acquired in June of this year, contributed $5.4 million in net revenue during the quarter. On the nontransaction side, access capacity fees increased 10% as compared to 3Q '21 and market data was up 7%.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported a year-over-year decline in net revenue for the third quarter of 8%. However, adjusting for a $7.1 million FX impact, given the stronger dollar during the quarter, net revenue grew by nearly 6% on a constant currency basis, helped by a 6.4 percentage point increase in market share on a year-over-year basis, making Cboe Europe the largest stock exchange in Europe for the quarter.\nThird quarter net revenue decreased by 2% in the Futures segment as transaction fees declined on a year-over-year basis. Volumes fell 8% during the quarter, partially offset by a 5% improvement in RPC. Nontransaction revenues continued to tick higher with access capacity fees up 2% and market data up 12% as compared to 3Q '21.\nAnd finally, net revenues in the FX segment were up a robust 21% as compared to 3Q '21. Net transaction and clearing fees benefited from a 27% increase in average daily notional value and higher levels of market share being a record 17.8% for the quarter.\nCboe's Data and Access Solutions net revenue growth has continued its strong momentum in 3Q, posting a 15% year-over-year increase and an attractive 12% growth rate on an organic basis. As we have seen in past quarters, net revenue growth was overwhelmingly driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for over 60% of the market data growth and 95% of the access fee growth for the quarter as opposed to the pricing changes.\nMore specifically, we saw robust physical and logical port usage in our options for these businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity. And on the market data side, the equity's top-of-book and options depth-of-book products continued to perform well.\nWe anticipate trends will remain healthy in the Data and Access Solutions business into year-end as we lap more meaningful comps from the fourth quarter of last year. We are reiterating our targeted 2022 DnA organic net revenue growth rate range of 10% to 13% and remain confident in our 7% to 10% medium-term guidance range outlined at our November 2021 Investor Day.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $173 million for the quarter, up 23% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 18% or $25 million for the quarter, largely reflecting higher headcount as compared to third quarter of last year as well as some inflationary comp adjustments and additional incentive compensation accrual in 3Q '22.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are reducing our full year 2022 expense guidance range to $651 million to $659 million, down from our prior guidance of $659 million to $667 million. The decrease in expense guidance is a product of diligent expense management as well as some delayed hiring for open positions as a result of the competitive labor market. The favorable expense trends are more than offsetting some incremental build in our employee incentive compensation given our strong year-to-date financial performance and 4Q expectations.\nAnd while our operating expense guidance is moving lower for the year, we are not wavering in our commitment to invest in our business over the long term. As reflected in our guidance, we expect to see incremental growth in our expense base in the fourth quarter as we work to fill open positions and invest behind the revenue-generating and infrastructure initiatives we outlined at the start of the year.\nWhile we're taking the current inflationary environment into our planning, we will continue to manage our cost base judiciously, but remain committed to investing aggressively behind high-return, high-conviction, high-growth investments. This includes the completion of our integration activities as well as the organic expansion of our Derivatives, Data and Access Solutions and digital networks. We look forward to sharing more about our 2023 guidance at our fourth quarter earnings call.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. I want to call out some updates given the year-to-date strength and confidence we have in the current operating environment. As noted previously, we're continuing to anticipate DnA organic net revenue growth in 2022 will be in the 10% to 13% range and remain confident in our medium-term guidance of 7% to 10%.\nWe continue to expect acquisitions held less than a year to contribute between 2 and 3 percentage points to total net revenue growth in 2022. Most importantly, we are increasing our overall organic net revenue growth target by 5 percentage points at the midpoint to 14% to 16%, up from our prior guidance of 9% to 11% for 2022.\nLastly, I want to note our full year guidance on depreciation and amortization and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings under the current tax laws remain unchanged, but we are lowering our CapEx guidance range to $40 million to $43 million from our prior guidance of $47 million to $52 million. Outside of our annual guidance, interest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $15.3 million. Moving forward, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $16 million to $17 million for 4Q '22.\nThe last thing I will note, as you think about your financial models moving forward, is that during the third quarter, we recognized an $8.3 million unrealized gain on the company's investment in 7RIDGE fund on our net other income line. This was an investment we announced in the fourth quarter of last year, with Cboe becoming a limited partner investing in the acquisition of trading technology.\nMoving forward, we expect that this investment will be revalued on a more regular basis in 2023. We do not expect to see any material impact in 4Q '22, and we'll look to provide some updated guidance on 2023 when we roll out fiscal year 2023 guidance with 4Q '22 results.\nOn the capital front, our focus has been and remains maximizing shareholder value through the effective use of our capital. In the third quarter, we returned a total of $53 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend. We remain well positioned to invest in the business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares, with $233 million in remaining capacity on our share repurchase authorization.\nOur leverage ratio decreased to 1.7x at the end of the third quarter, down from 1.9x at June 30 as we repaid $100 million on our term loan facility. Overall, we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet and striving to put capital to work in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.\nIn summary, the momentum in our business is evident in the strong third quarter results. We could not be happier with the progress we have made year-to-date and look forward to continuing to invest behind the many attractive opportunities we have to enhance shareholder value in the quarters to come.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian. In closing, I would like to thank our team for the incredible progress made throughout the third quarter. We have much to be proud of as we expand our business and continue to deliver on the goals to create a more sustainable future.\nAs an operator of markets around the globe, we continue to be focused on our carbon footprint as well as making a positive impact in the communities around the world in which we live and work. We have a lot of momentum going into the final quarter of the year and are well positioned for a strong finish to 2022.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nAt this point, we would be happy to take questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to Ken Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives.

Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Before I begin, I'm pleased to officially welcome Dave Howson to the U.S. He relocated to Chicago last week from London and is overseeing Cboe's business lines globally in his new role as President. We are excited to have him here today.\nI'm pleased to report on another strong quarter at Cboe Global Markets. During the quarter, we achieved record-setting revenue results, growing net revenue 21% year-over-year to a record $425 million, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 21% to $1.67. Our solid second quarter results were driven by the continued diversification of our business as we continue to integrate recent acquisitions with strong volume in our proprietary index products, increased trading activity on our cash equities businesses and continued growth across Data and Access Solutions business.\nOur derivatives business had another excellent quarter driven by strong performance in our index options franchise, specifically SPX options as well as a solid increase in our multi-listed options business. Record monthly activity in the FX complex helped drive a 66% increase in average daily volume for the quarter, while VIX futures were up 7%, and VIX options remained flat. Multi-listed options trading ADV increased 12% year-over-year.\nOur cash and spot markets business performed remarkably well during the second quarter with net revenue increasing 7%, including 3% organic net revenue growth year-over-year. These results were driven by exceptionally strong performance in our European equity segment, where average daily notional value traded was up 49% year-over-year.\nAdditionally, Cboe European equities market share increased nearly 6 percentage points year-over-year to 23.2%, similar trends we saw last quarter. These results reflect not just a favorable market backdrop, but the implementation of an analytics-driven campaign by our sales team to help clients achieve better results in Cboe Europe that is achievable on other venues.\nOur Data and Access Solutions business remains strong with the integration of our recent acquisitions continuing to fuel the durability of this business. Year-over-year net revenue increased 20% with 14% organic net revenue growth.\nWe continue to remain focused on executing on the significant opportunities we see in 3 core areas of our business: Data and Access Solutions, Derivatives and Cboe Digital. During the quarter, we made solid progress advancing each of these priorities, including closing the acquisition of ErisX on May 2. While the digital asset market environment has changed dramatically since we closed ErisX transaction, which resulted in the accounting adjustment that Brian will discuss in more detail, our strategy has not changed.\nWe remain excited by the compelling strategic opportunity for Cboe in the digital asset space. We believe the long-term opportunity within the digital asset space will continue to evolve. Now more than ever, market participants want a trusted, transparent, regulated market for digital assets, which is foundational to our strategy for this asset class. We are continuing to work closely with our partner group and expect to announce equity partners soon as we shape and define the future of Cboe Digital and the broader industry.\nTurning now to derivatives, where our SPX franchise continued to flourish as we expanded across to customers to meet increased demand, both on and off the trading floor. With market uncertainty and heightened volatility continuing across the globe, market participants turn to Cboe's derivatives and volatility products to help manage risk.\nMany of our newer initiatives, like the extension of trading hours for SPX and VIX options to nearly 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX Weekly options have outperformed our early expectations in 2022, further accelerating the strong growth across our core business. Since adding Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX Weekly options this spring, our initial estimates indicate we've added an average of over 200,000 incremental SPX contracts per day, reinforcing the trend we have seen of customers embracing shorter-duration trading strategies.\nThe expansion of our SPX Weekly is complex to include expiries every trading day has helped to meet this customer demand. ADV and SPX contracts with 0 days to expiration increased 120% since the start of 2021, with retail brokerage platforms accounting for over 80% of the volumes. Additionally, during global trading hours, average daily volume in SPX options increased 189% year-over-year. VIX options increased 49%, and VIX futures volumes increased 19%.\nGlobal customers want access to tools to manage risk. And we continue to focus on expanding upon our core strength and finding new ways to deliver access to meet their needs. We continue to believe strongly in the durability of our Data and Access Solutions business going forward as we continue to integrate our recently acquired businesses and strive to further unlock value and revenue opportunities.\nBrian will expand on this later in the call, but we are updating our 2022 organic net revenue growth expectations for this business to a range of 10% to 13%, up from our prior guidance range of 8% to 11%. The record results during the quarter were driven by continued demand for access to our global exchange network, Cboe's front-end platforms and proprietary market data.\nSince the first quarter 2021, we have averaged 19% year-over-year growth. And as we continue to integrate and innovate, we believe there is more total addressable market to capture across trading, data and products. And we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities through our Data and Access Solutions group.\nThree important areas of expansion we're excited about include distribution as a service, which leverages Cboe's expansive network to provide data stream and services for vendors and partners; bundled data, which allows us to package high-quality data from across markets to deliver consistent and cost-effective data solutions to customers; and Cboe's cloud strategy, which further extends Cboe's data to new users and geographies, an important step towards broadening investor access to our proprietary content and market data globally.\nThe last several years have been very exciting as we evolved our business, broadened our geographic reach and extended access to our unique set of products and services around the globe. Today, we are the only truly global market infrastructure provider, operating markets and delivering services around the world and around the clock every day of the week.\nAround the globe, we've continued to see strong performance in all geographies and asset classes. Starting with our global FX business, we saw strong volumes with average daily notional value topping $39.6 billion during the second quarter with market share of 17%.\nWe also saw our full amount offering, which provides clients with a solution for a larger order risk transference with low market impact reached a new record of $11.8 billion ADV in the second quarter. We're also very encouraged by our product diversification strategy, in particular, our higher-margin NDF offering, where we saw a 200% year-over-year increase to $785 million ADV. With continued rising inflation and interest rates, we continue to be bullish on the opportunities that exist for our FX business.\nTurning now to Europe. In addition to the strong results I noted earlier for our European equities business, Cboe BIDS Europe became the #1 block trading platform with a record 33% market share of the European block trading market. Additionally, EuroCCP, our European clearing business, saw steady growth this quarter.\nWe also continue to make progress on our European derivatives initiative. And while early volume trends have been softer than we expected due to geopolitical events in Europe, delaying customer onboarding timetables, we still believe strongly in the long-term strategy and the vision for this business.\nMoving to Asia Pacific. Cboe Japan market share increased to 3.5%, up from 2.5% 1 year ago as the new liquidity provider program introduced earlier this year continued to attract volume. In Australia, market share grew to 17% from 16% year-over-year, and we are on track to migrate Cboe Australia to our proprietary technology in February 2023.\nFinally, in North America, we completed the acquisition of NEO last month, bolstering our market share in Canada and expanding our listings business globally. Our overall market share in Canada now tops 12.1%, including both NEO and MATCHNow. And we are working on integration plans that will help enable us to maximize the opportunities we see for our global equities and listing businesses.\nOur geographic and asset class diversification, coupled with our unique product set, enables us to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse set of customers around the world. Our global scale gives us the unmatched ability to efficiently scale and expand our business in new ways.\nWith the closing of the acquisitions of ErisX and NEO in the second quarter, the entire Cboe team remains focused on extracting even greater value from the ecosystem we have created, integrating our platforms and positioning Cboe for its next wave of growth in the quarters ahead.\nWe've acquired 9 companies in the last 2 years, and we remain laser-focused on the various stages of integration for each of these companies. Each of these companies has brought a unique offering to Cboe and helped us achieve a greater global breadth of services and products as well as new distribution channels.\nAs we stated before, we approach the integration of technology and teams holistically, avoiding silos while maximizing synergies, both revenue and cost. This approach creates workflow efficiencies for customers, harmonizing technology and access points, creating a better experience for them.\nAs we continue to architect our business for the future, our strategy remains focused on delivering products and services that create short-, medium- and long-term opportunities, helping to enable and achieve a consistent growth. We are excited to have announced acquisitions closed and integration efforts well underway, which is creating strong momentum for our flywheel as we head into the second half of the year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Norman Schell\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Interim Chief HR Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q '22 as compared to 2Q '21 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. As Ed discussed, the first half of 2022 was an exceptionally strong one for Cboe.\nIn the second quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $1.67. A combination of continued investment across our businesses and a favorable operating environment continued to propel revenue above last quarter's record levels.\nQuickly touching on some of the noteworthy takeaways from the second quarter, our net revenue increased 21%, setting yet another quarterly record at $424 million led by the strength in our derivatives markets and Data and Access Solutions categories. I would like to note that not only did each of our revenue categories, derivatives, D&A and cash, post a year-over-year gain, but every segment at Cboe, from options to FX, posted a year-over-year increase, speaking to the diversity and truly broad-based strength in the second quarter results.\nDerivatives markets produced 30% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the second quarter, given the continued strength of our index business. Data and Access Solutions net revenues were up 20%, up 14% on an organic basis driven again by strong new subscription and unit growth. And cash and spot markets produced 7% net revenue growth for the quarter, up 3% on an organic basis on the back of strong volumes and market share in our European cash equities business. Adjusted operating expenses increased 22% to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $274 million was up 17%. And last, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.67, up 21% compared to last year's quarterly results.\nBefore getting into the segment results, I want to spend a moment walking through the accounting adjustment we made this quarter for ErisX. As Ed mentioned, we closed the ErisX transaction on May 2. The environment has changed dramatically. Given the observable publicly traded peer valuations, digital asset prices and intermediary dislocations, we felt it necessary to reassess our holding value of ErisX.\nAs a result of our analysis, along with the work of our third-party auditors and consultants, we booked a goodwill impairment of approximately $460 million, effectively writing goodwill in ErisX to 0 and recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $116 million. Our book carrying value at June 30 is $220 million, reflecting the sum of tangible and intangible assets of approximately $104 million and a deferred tax asset.\nWe believe that our adjustment reflects the reality of the digital asset market environment today, but in no way changes our commitment to the digital asset space or what we set out to do when we announced this transaction back in October. In fact, recent events only underscore the strong need for a transparent and trusted trading, clearing and data venue for digital assets. And we believe that Cboe, along with the help of industry partners, is best positioned to provide these solutions.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck include information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments, so I'll just provide summary thoughts.\nAs mentioned earlier, we saw impressive year-over-year growth in each of our segments during the quarter. Options delivered the strongest growth with net revenue growing by 32%, driven by higher trading volume in both proprietary and multi-listed options, better market share as well as higher revenue per contract and index options.\nTotal options ADV was up 18% as our higher-priced index options ADV increased 46%. Revenue per contract moved 21% higher, given a continued positive mix shift to index products and a stronger mix of higher-priced SPX options in our index business. And lastly, we continue to benefit from another quarter of double-digit growth in market data and access and capacity fees, each up 29%, respectively.\nNorth American Equities net revenue increased by 4% year-over-year. Solid industry volumes up 20%, helped drive the segment uptick. On the nontransaction side, access capacity fees increased 15%, and proprietary market data was up 8%.\nThe Europe and APAC segment reported solid growth for the quarter with net revenue up 20%. The increase was driven by higher volumes in Europe and the inclusion of Cboe Asia Pacific revenues of $8.2 million.\nNet transaction fee growth was 18%. During the quarter, FX rates were a headwind for the segment, impacting reported net revenue growth by nearly $4 million or 7%. Transaction fees were led higher by Cboe Europe's equity ADV, increasing 49% year-over-year given very strong industry volume growth and a nearly 6 percentage point increase in market share. Clearing fees benefited from an increase in clearing volumes of 21%.\nSecond quarter net revenue increased 8% in the future segment as both transaction and nontransaction revenue posted year-over-year gains for the quarter. Volume and rate for contract metrics were slightly better on a year-over-year basis.\nOn the nontransaction side, access capacity fees were up 21%, and market data grew 24% as compared to the second quarter of 2021. And finally, net revenues in the FX segment were up 20%. Net transactions and current fees benefited from a 22% increase in average daily notional value as well as continued favorable market share trends.\nAs Ed noted earlier, Cboe's Data and Access Solutions net revenue growth has continued to accelerate, posting 20% year-over-year increase and an attractive 14% growth rate on an organic basis. Again, this strong growth was primarily driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for 3/4 of the year-over-year revenue increase as opposed to pricing changes.\nMore specifically, we saw a robust physical and logical port usage in our options and equities businesses driven by increased demand for trading capacity. And on the market data side, the equities top-of-book and options depth-of-book products continue to perform well.\nAs we look out over the remainder of 2022, we anticipate trends will remain healthy in the Data and Access Solutions business. We are raising our targeted 2022 D&A organic net revenue growth rate to a range of 10% to 13%, up from 8% to 11% and above the 7% to 10% medium-term guidance range we outlined at our November Investor Day.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $157 million for the quarter, up 22% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 12% or $15 million for the quarter.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are increasing our full year 2022 expense guidance range to $659 million to $667 million, up from our prior guidance of $647 million to $660 million when including the acquisitions of ErisX and NEO. The increase is almost exclusively driven by higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong financial performance through the first half of this year, coupled with a positive outlook for the second half of 2022.\nWe have long talked about Cboe's pay-for-performance culture, and our adjustments today reflect the outstanding work our entire associate base has done in driving outsized growth. And while our operating expenses are moving higher with revenues, we continue to expect $23 million to $26 million of the 2022 investment spend to directly drive incremental revenue growth. And that approximately $10 million is needed for infrastructure enhancements to support and scale our business for greater levels of activity in the future.\nOverall, our updated 2022 expense guidance reflects our commitment to invest in high conviction growth opportunities as well as to attract and retain best-in-class talent driving our strong results.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. I want to call out some of the positive updates to our revenue targets that are reflected in our expense update.\nAs noted previously, we now anticipate D&A organic net revenue growth in 2022 will be in the 10% to 13% range, up from our prior guidance range of 8% to 11% and our medium-term guidance of 7% to 10%. We continue to expect acquisitions held less than the year to contribute between 2 to 3 percentage points to total net revenue growth in 2022.\nLastly, but certainly not least, our overall organic net revenue growth target is moving higher to 9% to 11%, up from our prior guidance of 5% to 7% for 2022. We believe our updated revenue guidance reflects not only the strong year-to-date results we have posted, but the confidence we have in the business moving forward.\nWe are seeing a solid contribution from all of our operating segments, strengthening the broader ecosystem here at Cboe. And our full year guidance on depreciation and amortization, CapEx and our effective tax rate and adjusted earnings under the current tax laws remain unchanged.\nOur interest expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $14.6 million. Factoring in the incremental borrowing costs related to the financing put in place for ErisX and NEO, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $16 million to $17 million for 3Q '22.\nOn the capital front, our focus has been and remains maximizing shareholder value through the effective use of our capital. In the second quarter, we returned a total of $67 million to shareholders, comprised of $51 million in dividend payments and $16 million in share repurchases. We remain well positioned to invest in the business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares with $233 million in remaining capacity on our share repurchase authorization.\nOur leverage ratio increased in the second quarter to 1.9x, up from 1.6x at June 30 as our debt levels increased related to the funding of our NEO and ErisX transactions. Overall, we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet and putting capital to work in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.\nIn summary, Cboe reported an excellent second quarter. Our core business performed exceptionally well, and we are excited about our numerous short-, medium- and long-term investments. We look forward to continuing to deliver durable growth for investors in the quarters ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian. Before I close, I wanted to highlight our 2022 ESG report, which was published last month. This report covers the important progress we've made on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, including our commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, an exciting endeavor designed to helping ensure Cboe does its part to help combat climate change.\nI want to thank the entire Cboe team and our customers for another great quarter. I couldn't be more excited about the progress we continue to make, and I believe we are well positioned to continue to innovate, integrate and grow as we head into the second half of the year.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nAt this point, we'd be happy to take questions.

Tilly\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on strong financial results for the first quarter 2022 at Cboe Global Markets, reflecting the continued strength of our business. During the quarter, year-over-year, we grew net revenue 14% to a record $418 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 13% to a record $1.73. Our solid first quarter results were driven by the ongoing expansion and diversification of our business, with strong trading activity in our cash equity business, higher volumes in our proprietary index products and increased demand for our suite of Data and Access Solutions.\nOur Options business had an outstanding quarter with a strong contribution from our proprietary index products and solid results from our multi-listed Options business. Our proprietary index products resonated well with our customers as volatility continued to remain steadily elevated around the world and market participants engage with our product suite to manage risk.\nAverage daily volume increased 42% in SPX options year-over-year with VIX options increasing slightly year-over-year and up 18% over the fourth quarter 2021. Multi-listed options trading ADV increased 2% year-over-year to a new record of 11 million contracts per day. Additionally, our European Equity segment had a very strong quarter. Net revenue increased 37% as industry average daily notional value traded increased 31% and market share rose 5 percentage points year-over-year to 21.8%, the highest since the first quarter of 2019.\nThese results were driven by not just favorable market backdrop, but by the expansion of our data and analytics services to help clients improve the quality of their executions and enhance their overall trading experience across our lit and dark order books, periodic auctions and Cboe BIDS Europe. On the U.S. equity side, we were pleased to launch periodic auctions on our BYX Exchange earlier this month and hope to replicate the success we've had with our European periodic auctions offering.\nTurning to Asia Pacific. Cboe Japan market share increased considerably during the first quarter to 3.8%, up from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of new liquidity provider program designed to attract new volume to the market. We are excited to have a growing footprint in Japan, which is the fourth largest equities market in the world by volume traded.\nIn Australia, volumes remained strong across our equities business and we are also preparing to list Asia Pacific's first crypto ETFs on Cboe Australia in the coming weeks. We're excited to be helping to bring these innovative products to market. Importantly, while achieving strong results, we continue to successfully execute on key initiatives to advance our corporate strategy to innovate, integrate and grow our business globally.\nIn February, we completed the migration of MATCHNow, the largest equities alternative trading system in Canada, to Cboe technology, creating a unified training experience for all of our North American customers. Along with this technology migration, we launched Cboe BIDS Canada, bringing a new and enhanced block trading offering to the Canadian equities market.\nIt's important to note that these enhancements are already benefiting from our platform with the migration of MATCHNow, improving latency and institutional activity increasing with over 10 sponsoring brokers signed on as Cboe BIDS Canada sponsors. We look forward to further expanding our footprint in Canadian equities market, with the expected close of our acquisition of NEO later this quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\nWe also announced plans to migrate Cboe Australia to our world-class technology platform in February 2023, pending regulatory review and approval, and released technical specifications for this migration a month ahead of schedule. We appreciate the early engagement with customers in Australia on this important initiative, and we will be working closely with them throughout the year as they make their preparations for the migration.\nAs we continue to broaden and evolve Cboe, our global network gives us the unmatched ability to efficiently scale and expand our business in new ways, both organically and inorganically. As we architect the business for future growth, I was incredibly excited to announce several leadership changes last month, including the appointment of David Howson to President of Cboe on May 12.\nMany of you know Dave well, as he currently serves as President of our European and Asia Pacific segments and has done a remarkable job working with the team and our customers to successfully grow these businesses. His track record speaks volumes, and he has spearheaded the development and execution of some of Cboe's most innovative products and services. Dave is planning to relocate from London to Chicago and will oversee Cboe's business lines globally. Please welcome Dave as he joins us on the call today. I believe the enhancements to our management team showcase our deep bench of talent and position Cboe well to advance our global expansion strategy.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are focused on executing on the transformational opportunities we see in 3 core areas of our business: Data and Access Solutions, Derivatives and Cboe Digital. We continue to fuel these opportunities by executing against our ongoing strategy, which remains consistent: leverage our superior technology; further strengthen our core proprietary products; increase recurring revenue; and expand our product line by geography and asset class. During the first quarter, we made solid progress advancing each of these core areas of our business.\nLet me begin with Data and Access Solutions, which delivered record results during the quarter with revenues increasing 18%. This growth was driven by continued demand for access to our exchanges, proprietary market data and new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms. Cboe Global Cloud, a cloud-based market data streaming service we launched during the fourth quarter, continues to gain traction with customers. This new service aims to increase access to our unique data set to customers globally. We plan to further expand the data set offered via Cboe Global Cloud this summer, with the addition of European equities data, which we believe will further expand the customer base accessing our data via the cloud.\nWe continue to believe this business is positioned incredibly well moving forward. Given our confidence, we are increasing our 2022 targeted organic growth rate for Data and Access Solutions to 8% to 11% from 7% to 10%. Our unique product set, coupled with our geographic and asset class diversification, enables us to meet the needs of customers from London to Tokyo, Chicago to Singapore and everywhere in between. As the world continues to grapple with uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and interest rates and the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, market participants have increasingly turned to derivatives and volatility vehicles to help mitigate risk. We continue to innovate and expand our derivatives business globally to meet this ongoing customer need by growing 24x5 trading in SPX and VIX options, expanding our popular SPX Weekly's options offering to provide expirations every trading day of the week starting in May; and launching Nanos, a new smaller size product designed for the retail trader.\nEarlier, I noted our overall strong volumes across our proprietary products franchise, as we continue to see solid momentum trading in SPX and VIX options since launching 24x5 trading in November 2021. During the first quarter, average daily volume in SPX options during global trading hours increased 164% year-over-year, more than double the volume prior to launch of 24x5. Additionally, average daily volume in VIX options during global trading hours increased 14% year-over-year, while VIX futures volumes increased 19%. Although still in its early days, the incremental volume we are seeing as a result of 24x5 enhancements has already generated an attractive return on our 2021 investment.\nLast week, we added Tuesday expirations to our SPX Weeklys complex and plan to add Thursday expirations beginning May 11. These new listings build on the success of our SPX Weeklys, which currently include Monday, Wednesday and Friday expiries. Since we launched SPX Weeklys in 2005, they have become one of the most actively traded products, accounting for 70% of total SPX options volume as they allow investors to manage their short-term U.S. equity market exposure and execute trading strategies with even greater frequency, precision and flexibility. We have received very positive feedback from a broad range of market participants, and we are off to a strong start.\nOn Tuesday, we saw over 600,000 Tuesday expiry contracts traded. Last month, we were excited to launch Nanos, a first-of-its-kind options contract designed to make trading more accessible for the retail trader. We have been pleased with initial volumes, which have topped 3,500 contracts on several days, and we plan to continue to expand the network of retail brokers offering this product. We expect this market to continue to flourish over time, and we look forward to engaging with this growing retail segment.\nTurning now to Europe. Our European Derivatives business continues to gain momentum, and we are pleased with the progress made since launch last September. Volumes continue to grow, and we reported over 6,000 contracts traded in the first quarter, an almost fourfold increase on last quarter's volumes. Earlier this week, we launched Futures and Options on 4 additional country indices: Italy, Spain, Sweden and Norway. This second phase of products broadens our equity index product suite to cover additional key European markets, providing customers with the tools to efficiently manage their European index exposures via a single marketplace. The expansion of our global derivatives franchise is laying a strong foundation to build upon throughout the rest of the year as we help clients around the world navigate risk.\nTurning now to Cboe Digital and our planned acquisition of ErisX, which remains on track to close very soon, subject to customary closing conditions. ErisX will provide Cboe with spot trading, data and clearing capabilities for digital assets and derivatives trading, clearing and data through its regulated futures exchange and clearinghouse. This is a pivotal moment for Cboe as we reenter the digital asset market, and we couldn't be more excited to apply our blueprint of success, operating trusted, transparent, regulated markets to digital assets. As we said before, we believe Cboe can play a guiding role in shaping the trajectory of this revolutionary market. We have been actively engaged with regulators as they shape policy for this emerging asset class.\nAdditionally, the ErisX application for merchant futures is currently in review at the CFTC. We look forward to welcoming the ErisX team to Cboe and accomplishing great things together as Cboe Digital. We are focused on driving durable growth here at Cboe, and I believe the targeted investments we are making across the ecosystem today not only help us diversify our product set and strengthen our flywheel, but also allow us to enhance the robustness of our revenue growth, the ability to harvest investments over various periods of time from near-term contributors like Tuesday/Thursday expiries and 24x5 to longer-term investments in place like Nanos, position Cboe well to grow for years to come.\nAnd now I will turn over to Brian.\n\nBrian Norman Schell\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Interim Chief HR Officer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me remind everyone that, unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 1Q '22 as compared to 1Q '21 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.\nAs Ed discussed, the year is off to a very strong start, producing the second consecutive record-setting quarter for Cboe. Overall, adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 13% on a year-over-year basis to $1.73, and both the transaction and nontransaction elements of our business performed well. We believe these strong results validate our investment focus as we continue to put capital to work across our ecosystem to help us enable to take full advantage of the favorable market dynamics.\nQuickly touching on some of the noteworthy takeaways from the first quarter. Our net revenue increased 14%, notching another quarterly record at $418 million, led by the strength in our Derivatives Markets and Data and Access Solutions categories. I would like to note the change in our income statement to reflect cash and spot markets, Data and Access Solutions and derivatives market categories, we laid out at the November Investor Day. The update reflects how we think about the business, in addition to our segments, and how we will be reporting our results moving forward. You can find more details in our 10-Q.\nNoting a couple of highlights for our updated categories in the first quarter. Derivatives markets produced 18% year-over-year organic net revenue growth in the first quarter, given the strength of our index business. Data and Access Solutions net revenues were also up 18%, up 12% on an organic basis, helped by strong new subscription and unit growth. And cash and spot markets produced 5% net revenue growth for the quarter, up 2% on an organic basis on the back of strong volumes and market share in our European cash equities business.\nPlease note that historical quarterly values for these categories covering the 2020 and 2021 time frames are available on our IR site. Adjusted operating expenses increased 17% to $146 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $281 million was up 12%. And last, our adjusted diluted earnings per share hit a record $1.73, up 13% compared to last year's quarterly results.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics for each of our business segments. So I'll just provide some summary thoughts. We saw impressive year-over-year growth in many of our segments during the quarter. Options delivered exceptional net revenue growth of 21%, driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary and multi-listed options, better market share as well as higher revenue per contract, or RPC in index options.\nTotal options ADV was up 6% as our higher-margin index options volumes increased 27% over 1Q '21 levels. RPC moved higher by 18% given the continued positive mix shift to index products and a stronger mix of higher-priced SPX options in our index business. And lastly, we continue to benefit from another quarter of double-digit growth in market data and access and capacity fees, up 26% and 22%, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nNorth American Equities net revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year against some difficult comparisons to the first quarter of 2021. Industry volumes were lower by 12%, and market share declined by 70 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. On a sequential basis, market share improved by a full percentage point and industry ADV was up nearly 20%.\nOn the nontransaction side, access capacity fees increased 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. The Europe and APAC segment again delivered outsized growth for the quarter, with net revenue up 37%. The increase was driven by higher volumes and the inclusion of Cboe Asia Pacific revenues of $8.4 million.\nNet transaction fee growth of 47% outpaced solid clearing fee growth of 10%. Transaction fees were led higher by Cboe Europe's equity ADV increasing 71% year-over-year given very strong industry volume growth and a 5 percentage point increase in market share. Clearing fees benefited from an increase in clearing volumes of 52%. First quarter revenue increased 2% in the Futures segment as transaction and nontransaction revenues posted slight gains for the quarter. Volumes and rate for contract metrics were relatively flat year-over-year. On the nontransaction side, access and capacity fees were up 2% and market data grew 25% as compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nAnd finally, revenues in the FX segment were up 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Net transaction and clearing fees benefited from a 13% increase in average daily notional value traded and a slight increase in net capture rates.\nAs noted previously, Cboe's Data and Access Solutions revenue growth started the year on strong footing with 18% total growth and 12% organic growth as compared to 1Q '21. Again, the strong growth was primarily driven by additional subscriptions and units, accounting for over 90% of the year-over-year revenue increase as opposed to pricing changes. More specifically, we saw robust physical and logical port usage in our Options and equities businesses, driven by increased demand for trading capacity.\nAnd on the market data side, the equities top-of-book and Options depth of book products continued to perform well. As we look to 2022, we see tremendous potential for the Data and Access Solutions business. We are raising our targeted DnA, organic net revenue growth rate to 8% to 11% from the 7% to 10% range, slightly above the medium-term guidance delivered at our November Investor Day.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $146 million for the quarter, up 17% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 12% or $15 million for the quarter.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are reaffirming our full year expense guidance range of $617 million to $625 million for 2022. As we have previously stated, we expect our expense base to build over the course of this year as we invest behind many attractive initiatives at Cboe. We expect $23 million to $26 million of the 2022 investment spend to directly drive incremental revenue growth. We believe that approximately $10 million is needed for infrastructure enhancements to support and scale our business for greater levels of activity in the future.\nIn the past, we have talked to investments in areas like DnA or our EuroCCP acquisition and integration as producing solid returns for Cboe. I would like to point out that a few of our more recent 2021 investments are already producing some very attractive returns as well. For instance, 24x5, which went live in November, has translated to year-to-date global trading hour volumes in the SPX options contract or the doubling 2021 levels averaging over 27,000 contracts per day in the first quarter.\nTuesday expirations went live last week. In this Tuesday, we saw over 600,000 Tuesday expiry contracts traded a very strong start. We recognize that each of the investments we made across our ecosystem is unique with different return profiles, payback periods and levels of complexity. In each case, though, we leverage the same core attributes that make Cboe, Cboe, the ability to leverage our superior technology and unmatched global footprint and a cohesive trading experience across asset classes. We invest consistently behind this framework so that we can harvest the investments across cycles from short-term initiatives like 24x5 to longer-term endeavors like the EuroCCP acquisition, the EU derivatives launch, introduction of BIDS block trading capabilities in new equities markets and other multiyear integration and technology migration activities.\nLooking ahead to our pending acquisitions. We expect to close the ErisX transaction very soon, subject to customary closing conditions and anticipating midyear closing for NEO, also subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. Adjusting our prior expense framework for the updated timing, we expect the acquisitions of ErisX and NEO to add an incremental $30 million to $35 million to our 2022 guided range of $617 million to $625 million. We continue to anticipate that revenues from ErisX and NEO will offset more than half of the expenses in 2022, with an expectation that the additions are EBITDA-positive on a combined basis in year 2. The company plans to further refine this guidance for 2022 after the acquisitions close.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. Given our early year performance and positive outlook for the businesses, we are providing incrementally positive updates for the many elements we spoke to at our Investor Day back in November. Specifically, as we have already mentioned, we now anticipate DnA organic net revenue growth will be in the 8% to 11% range, up from the previous guidance of 7% to 10%. Acquisitions held less than a year have performed well, and we are slightly increasing our guidance, calling for acquisitions held less than a year to contribute between 2 and 3 percentage points to total net revenue growth in 2022, up from our prior guidance of 1 to 3 percentage points. And our overall organic net revenue growth target remains unchanged after the first quarter at 5% to 7% for 2022. But we see potential upside to our revenue expectations given the early performance of our growth initiatives and the year-to-date macro trading environment.\nDepreciation and amortization is expected to be in the $40 million to $44 million range. Our CapEx guidance range is $47 million to $52 million for the full year, and we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in the 27.5% to 29.5% range for 2022 under the current tax laws.\nOur interest expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $10.8 million. Given the incremental borrowing costs related to the financing put in place ahead of the planned acquisitions of ErisX and NEO, which includes an expanded and longer-tenured revolving credit facility, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $14 million to $15 million for 2Q '22.\nOn the capital front. Our focus has been and remains maximizing shareholder value through the effective use of our capital. In the first quarter, we returned a total $121 million to shareholders, comprised of $51 million of dividend payments and $70 million in share repurchases. We remain well-positioned to invest in the business, support our dividend and opportunistically repurchase shares with $249 million in remaining capacity on our share repurchase authorization.\nOur leverage ratio increased versus the prior quarter to 1.6x at March 31, as our debt levels increased with the issuance of a 10-year note in anticipation of our NEO and ErisX transactions. Overall, we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet and putting capital to work in the most value-enhancing way possible for shareholders.\nIn summary, Cboe kicked off 2022 on very strong footing with a record quarter, and we remain confident in the many attractive initiatives we were investing in across the Cboe ecosystem. We look forward to continuing to deliver strong and sustainable results for investors in the quarters ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward T. Tilly\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. In closing, I would like to thank our team for the incredible progress made throughout the first quarter. 2022 is off to an exceptional start. And with the help of our dedicated associates, we are well-positioned to define markets globally, delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\n\nKenneth William Hill\n\nVP of IR, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\n(Operator Instructions)"

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nAt this time, for opening introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nKenneth Hill - Head of IR\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings conference call.\nOn the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss our performance for the quarter and provide an update for our strategic initiatives. Then Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter as well as an update on our 2022 financial outlook. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward look statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call. During the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward Tilly - Chairman of the Board\n\nThank you, Ken. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I hope the year is off to a good start for all of you, and I hope the year ahead sees us turning the page in this global pandemic.\nI'm pleased to report on a strong fourth quarter and record full year results for Cboe Global Markets. For the year, we grew net revenue 18% to a record $1.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS grew by 15%. For the quarter, we reported revenue growth across each of our business segments, reflecting strong year-over-year increases in both transaction and recurring non-transaction revenues.\nOur results were driven by higher volumes across our businesses, coupled with increased demand from our suite of data and access solutions. In our proprietary products, ADV increased by 50% in VIX futures, 10% in VIX options and 47% in SPX options. We also continue to see strong growth in multi-listed options trading with ADV up 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we also announced key planned acquisitions designed to strategically expand our global network, including ARRIS X, which is expected to provide Cboe with spot trading, data, derivatives and clearing capabilities for digital assets through its regulated futures exchange and clearinghouse and Neo Exchange, which is expected to provide us with a significant presence in the Canadian equities market. We also invested as a limited partner in Trading Technologies, a global provider of professional trading software, connectivity and data solutions. The ARRIS X and Neo deals, which I'll touch on or detail later and are subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions, are expected to further expand our ecosystem of market infrastructure and tradable products as we continue to build out 1 of the world's largest and most comprehensive derivatives and securities networks.\nTurning to our targets and expectations for this year. Similar to last year, we plan to leverage new and recent acquisitions to fuel future investment opportunities across our business in 2022. Our recent expansion into Asia Pacific, Canada and our planned reentry into digital assets further expands our global ecosystem, providing Cboe the ability to drive growth as we innovate, integrate and grow.\nTo highlight a few recent examples. Last week, we reached 2 important milestones for these recent acquisitions. In Canada, we completed our year-long effort to migrate the technology platform of MATCHNow, the largest equities alternative system in Canada to Cboe technology. We also launched Cboe BIDS Canada, bringing BIDS leading block trading capabilities to the Canadian market. We were very pleased and grateful for the strong engagement and widespread support from customers, vendors, regulators and other market participants throughout the migration process.\nIn Asia Pacific, we rebranded the Chi-X businesses to Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan and announced our planned technology migration road map for Cboe Australia, anticipating a February 27, 2023, migration of exchange to Cboe technology pending regulatory review and approval. Brian will do a deeper dive in prepared remarks, but we plan to invest an incremental $23 million to $26 million of organic growth initiatives tied to revenue in 2022. Initiatives we expect to contribute to our top line and annual organic revenue growth target of 5% to 7% over the medium term.\nOur results from this year reaffirm our view that further investment in our business can help us deliver value for shareholders.\nKey to the long-term success of Cboe will be the ability to execute on the transformational opportunities we see in 3 core areas of our business: data and access solutions, derivatives and Cboe Digital. We will fuel these opportunities by executing against our ongoing strategy, which remains consistent, leverage our superior technology, further strengthen our core proprietary products, increase recurring revenue and expand our product line by geography and asset class.\nLet me begin with data and access solutions, where we continue to see strong momentum resulting in a 21% increase in our recurring non-transaction revenue for the quarter. This growth was driven by continued demand for access to our exchanges, proprietary market data and new subscribers to Cboe's front-end platforms.\nDuring the quarter, we were excited to launch Cboe Global Cloud, a cloud-based market data streaming service that aims to optimize the efficiency and delivery of Cboe's data services for market participants globally. The launch of Cboe Global Cloud is an excellent example of utilizing technology solutions to increase access for new and existing data products to new customers around the world.\nProspective customers may not have access to one of our data centers, but they have an Internet connection and can now benefit from our truly unique data set that is unrivaled amongst exchanges. This year, G&A will be able to realize the full value of our global expansion efforts as we were able to add new data sets and penetrate new markets with our products and services.\nWe are also focused on growing our index and analytics platforms and services and have made key hires that we believe can help fuel sales of this business.\nData and Access Solutions posted a very strong fourth quarter to cap an excellent 2021, and we believe the business is positioned incredibly well moving forward. We anticipate Data and Access Solutions organic revenues will grow at a 7% to 10% rate in 2022, consistent with our medium-term guidance provided at Investor Day in November.\nIt was an exciting quarter for our derivatives businesses, and we continue to expand access to our products and services globally through new initiatives, including the successful launch of 24/5 training for SPX and fix options, scaling of our new European derivatives business and the continued engagement of retail customers in the options market. Additionally, while we're only 5 weeks into the new year, we are seeing strong volumes across our proprietary products franchise. In January, month over-quarter volume increased 31% in VIX futures, 24% in VIX options and 17% in SPX options. We have seen a strong start to 24/5 trading since launching in late November, validating our belief that global customers want access to tools like our proprietary products around the clock.\nIn January, average daily volume in SPX options during global trading hours was nearly 24,000 contracts, up from an ADV of approximately 11,000 contracts prior to the launch of 24/5. We are also seeing positive impact from VIX options as a result of the 24/5 trading initiative, and we look forward to continuing to expand access to our suite of proprietary products to new and existing customers.\nIn that vein, earlier this week, we were excited to announce a planned March 14 launch date for Nanos' pending regulatory approval. Nanos' is a first-of-its-kind options contract designed to make trading more accessible for the retail trader. We are excited to have a number of retail brokers offering the product on day 1, including interactive brokers, TradeStation, Trader and Lebel, who recently added SPX and VIX options to their suite of products.\nAs the retail market continues to grow, we remain committed to investing in education and product development to meet their unique needs. In tandem with Nanos' launch, the Options Institute will unveil new curriculum customized for retail audience. We expect this market to continue to grow over time, and we look forward to welcoming a new generation of options traders with the launch of Nanos.\nAs we expand access to new customers around the world, we have an opportunity to integrate them into the Cboe ecosystem across many touch points via access to new asset classes, products and services. This week, we also announced plans to expand SPX Weekly options with the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations pending regulatory approval. With these planned new listings, Cboe will offer SPX Weekly options that expire each and every trading day, providing traders with additional tools to manage their short-term U.S. equity market exposure and execute trading strategies with even greater frequency, precision and flexibility.\nWe have seen increasing levels of interest and adoption for short-dated option strategies through our Monday, Wednesday and Friday weekly exploration contracts, driving trading volume growth in the AsetXcomplex in recent years. We see the launch of Tuesday, Thursday expiries as a way to build on the success of existing weeklies and look forward to bringing these to the market.\nOn the retail front, we saw solid growth in SPX options trading on retail broker platforms with ADV on those platforms up 8% from the third quarter, hitting a new all-time high.\nTurning now to Europe. I'm pleased to report that our recently launched European derivatives market continues to gain momentum. Since launching a few months ago, we have laid a strong foundation for future growth and product expansion. We grew the number of participants trading on the exchange and volume continue to grow month-over-month. The market is off to a strong start in 2022 with nearly 2,000 contracts tuned in January, already surpassing our total in 2021.\nIn terms of product expansion, we are planning to launch futures and options on 4 additional Cboe European country indices, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Norway, next quarter, subject to regulatory approval. And we have already secured market making support for this product complex expansion.\nLater in the second quarter, we plan to also launch weekly options on our Phase 1 index products, and our longer-term plans include a third phase of product expansion to include a European single-stock options, subject to regulatory approvals. We are very excited about the many initiatives in the works with the derivative franchise, and we find new ways to deliver access and meet client needs around the world.\nTurning to Cboe Digital and our planned acquisition of ARRIS X, which remains on track to close in the first half of 2022 and is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.\nWe've been pleased with the reception from regulators and state approval processes progressing as expected. As the appetite for ownership and digital assets continues to grow, we believe Cboe can play a guiding role in shaping the trajectory of this revolutionary market.\nWhile this is a new asset class, we can apply our blueprint of success, operating trusted, transparent regulated markets to this experience. While much of the market focus today is on a transaction opportunity, we also see tremendous potential to generate and provide benchmark crypto data that is currently opaque and untimely in many instances. Our teams are working closely behind the scenes on integration and road map planning.\nWe're also excited to close the transaction with the Airtex team and our incredible partner group of investors and engage market participants to charge Cboe's course in this exciting new frontier.\nWe're excited about both the near and long-term opportunities to grow and expand our business, and believe we have a strong momentum as we kick off 2022. We are well positioned to move up into attractive and expanding addressable markets across all of our businesses, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity set in front of us today. We expect these initiatives to help us further strengthen our position as one of the world's largest global derivatives and securities networks.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Schell - CFO\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q '21 as compared to 4Q '20 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.\nAs Ed spoke to, fourth quarter was a very strong finish to an exciting and record-setting year at Cboe. Overall adjusted earnings per share were up 41% on a year-over-year basis and 17% sequentially, as both the transaction and nontransaction businesses turned in excellent results.\nFurthermore, as we look at trends through January, we have seen continued acceleration across our businesses.\nQuickly looking back at some of the noteworthy takeaways from the fourth quarter, our net revenue increased 27%, matching another quarterly record. Net transaction fees were up 42% and recurring non-transaction revenue was up 21%. Adjusted operating expenses increased 23%. Adjusted EBITDA of $264 million was up 28%. And last, but certainly not least, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $1.70, up 41% compared to last year's quarterly results.\nTurning to the key drivers by segment. Our press release and the appendix of our slide deck includes information detailing the key metrics from each of our business segments. So I'll just provide summary thoughts. We saw year-over-year growth in all of our segments for the second consecutive quarter. Options delivered exceptional growth of 25%, driven by higher trading volumes in both our proprietary multi-listed options as well as higher revenue per contract, or RPC, and index options.\nTotal auctions ADV was up 23% as we again saw double-digit increases in both index and multi-listed options. RPC moved higher by 9%, given a positive mix shift to index products and a solid increase in our index options RPC, up 5%. And lastly, we continue to benefit from another quarter of double-digit growth in recurring non-transaction revenue, particularly access and capacity fees, which were up 20% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nNorth American Equities net revenue increased 24% year-over-year as industry volumes moved slightly higher, further helped by solid growth in proprietary market data fees and access to capacity fees. Net capture meaningfully improved on a year-over-year basis, somewhat offset by a decline in market share.\nAs we move forward, we continue to look to strike the right balance between market share and pricing, while delivering on quality market data, innovative new order types and functionality to the market. For the quarter, BIDS contributed $8.5 million in net revenue. Lastly, recurring non-transaction organic revenue increased by more than $4 million or 13%.\nThe Europe and APAC segment delivered outsized growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, with net revenue up 46%. The increase was driven by higher volumes and the inclusion of Chi-X Asia-Pacific revenues of $8.5 million. Clearing fee growth outpaced transactions as settlement volumes were up 25%, clearing volumes up 19% and European equity market ADV was up 17%, coupled with market share growth of 230 basis points.\nFourth quarter revenue increased in futures by 39%, benefiting from a 44% increase in ADV and a 5% increase in capture. We continue to see steady engagement in our futures business to start the year, with January ADV up 32% from fourth quarter levels. And finally, revenues in the FX segment increased 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as net capture moved higher and trading volumes remained steady.\nDuring the quarter, Cboe recorded its sixth consecutive record ADV quarter at $725 million versus $135 million in fourth quarter 2020. Cboe's recurring non-transaction revenue growth accelerated from strong third quarter levels, with a year-over-year organic growth reaching 15% in the fourth quarter. Again, the strong growth was primarily driven by additional subscriptions and units as opposed to price increases. More specifically, we saw robust physical and logical port usage in our equities and options businesses driven by increased demand for trading capacity. And on the market data side, the equities top of book and options depth of book products are performing well.\nAs we look to 2022, we see tremendous potential for the Data and Access Solutions business. We are targeting D&A organic net revenue growth to run in the 7% to 10% range for the year, in line with the medium-term guidance we delivered at our November Investor Day. We look to continue to invest strategically in the business to unlock its full potential within the Cboe ecosystem.\nTurning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were approximately $138 million for the quarter, up 23% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions owned less than a year, adjusted operating expenses were up 13% or $15 million for the quarter. Most of the expense variance related to the acquisitions was compensation and benefits.\nMoving to our expense guidance. We are introducing a full year expense guidance range of $617 million to $625 million for 2022. This guidance incorporates our run rate expenses as of December, coupled with a healthy level of investment spend in the year ahead, a reflection of our conviction in the many high-margin, high-return opportunities ahead of us.\nThroughout 2021, we have consistently messaged that we would be investing in our business, strengthening our global infrastructure and laying the groundwork to support future growth. We see 2022 as a year where we make many of those investments. We expect $23 million to $26 million of the 2022 investment spend to directly drive incremental revenue growth at for greater levels of activity in the future.\nI think it's important to spend some time illustrating how some of our recent investments have led to higher levels of revenue growth. Most recently, Cboe has invested purposely in Data and Access Solutions, European clearing and derivatives and the expansion of core product set, with initiatives like 24/5 and a planned launch of Nannos. While we are by no means finished, we are already seeing attractive returns that contribute to today's 41% year-over-year growth in EPS for the fourth quarter and record results for the full year.\nMore specifically, in Data and Access Solutions, we delivered 21% growth and recurring non-transaction revenue for the fourth quarter and 20% growth for the full year. This growth was made possible by investing and integrating recent acquisitions to build a global distribution and sales platform.\nAs we look to take on D&A business to the next level, we are investing in cloud capabilities, hiring senior sales talent and further building out our index franchise to help unlock the full potential of the platform and broadening our potential revenue expansion opportunities in the years ahead.\nEuroCCP was an investment we made a little over 1.5 years ago that is driving more meaningful revenue at Cboe. Not only has EuroCCP vastly exceeded our initial expectations, but it has also laid the groundwork for European derivatives business that is beginning to take shape. While European derivatives is still a minimal contributor today, we have seen January contract volume and open interest nearly triple from December levels. We will look to expand on that growth with plans to introduce 4 new contracts in April and weekly options later in the second quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval.\nLastly, 24/5 trading on the SPX and VIX options contracts went live on November 21. As Ed highlighted, in only a short amount of time, 24/5 has delivered incremental volumes to our platform, not to mention the ancillary benefits of greater market data and access fees and an expanded customer base. We expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to facilitate greater volumes across our platforms.\nWe believe these initiatives exemplify our philosophy at Cboe, leverage our superior technology, further strengthen our core proprietary products, increase recurring revenue and expand our product line by geography and asset class. While not included in our formal 2022 expense guidance range of $617 million to $625 million, we believe the pending acquisitions of ARRIS X and Neo has the potential to add an incremental $36 million to $42 million of expenses in 2022, contingent on the timing of closings, which are subject to regulatory reviews and other customary closing conditions. We anticipate a potential revenue offset for more than half of the expense in 2022, with an expectation that the additions are EBITDA positive on a combined basis in year 2. The company plans to further update its guidance for 2022 after the acquisitions close, which is expected in the first half of this year.\nLooking forward, we see numerous opportunities to invest in ways that fuel sustainable earnings growth for years to come. Investments have delivered a double-digit return on invested capital that shareholders have received and they come to expect.\nNow turning to a summary of full year guidance on the next slide. We are reaffirming many of the elements you've heard us speak to at our Investor Day back in November. Specifically, we anticipate D&A organic net revenue growth will be in the 7% to 10% range. Acquisitions held less than a year are expected to add 1 to 3 percentage points to total net revenue growth this year. Inorganic net revenue growth is expected to be 5% to 7% in 2022.\nDepreciation and amortization is expected to be in the $40 million to $44 million range. Our CapEx guidance range is $47 million to $52 million for the full year, and we anticipate our tax rate will fall in the 27.5% to 29.5% range for 2022 under the current tax laws.\nOur interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $11.1 million. During the first quarter, we anticipate incremental borrowing costs as we put financing in place for the acquisitions of ARIS X and Neo, which includes an expanded and longer-tenured revolving credit facility. Given this expected activity in the debt markets, interest expense is expected to be in the range of $12 million to $12.5 million for 1Q '22.\nWhile the investment priorities have taken on a bigger role in our capital allocation strategy, as of late, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In total, we returned $52 million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter. We remain opportunistic around share repurchases, with $319 million in remaining repurchase authorization available. Our leverage ratio decreased slightly versus the prior quarter to 1.3x at December 31 as our debt levels remained steady on a sequential basis.\nGiven the anticipated funding of Neo and ARRIS X, we expect our leverage ratio to expand in the quarters ahead, but we remain committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet over time.\nIn summary, Cboe delivered a very strong fourth quarter to close the year, and 2021's record results give us increased confidence that if we continue to invest in the Cboe ecosystem, we can continue to deliver strong long-term results for investors.\nNow I'd like to turn it back over to Ed for some closing comments before we open it up to Q&A.\n\nEdward Tilly - Chairman of the Board\n\nThanks, Brian. In closing, it's an exciting time at Cboe as we continue to execute on our strategy and initiatives, aimed at accelerating growth and value creation as we innovate, integrate and grow. We are extremely proud of the record results we delivered in 2021, and I'm even more excited about the opportunities ahead.\nThe investments we plan to make this year are expected to contribute to our long-term growth in 2022 and beyond.\nI want to thank the entire Cboe team for their dedication and hard work to continue to put Cboe to new heights.\nWith that, I'll turn it to Ken for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nKenneth Hill - Head of IR\n\nAt this point, we will be happy to take your questions.
